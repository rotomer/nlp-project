Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Underwriting Agreement
 
On August 9, 2012, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (the "Corporation") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Corporation, the selling stockholders listed on Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Selling Stockholders") and Barclays Capital Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as underwriters (the "Underwriters"), with respect to the sale by the Selling Stockholders of an aggregate of 58,000,000 shares of Class P common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares").  The Shares sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement were registered under the Corporation's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179812), which became automatically effective on March 1, 2012. The closing of the sale of the Shares occurred on August 15, 2012.
 
The net proceeds to the Selling Stockholders from the sale of the Shares, after deducting the underwriting discounts, were approximately $2,001.6 million. Neither the Corporation nor the Corporation's management sold any shares of common stock in the offering, and the Corporation did not receive any of the proceeds from the offering of the Shares by the Selling Stockholders.
 
The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Corporation, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriter against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with sale of the Shares and for customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities.
 
The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Underwriting Agreement has been filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Corporation. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Underwriting Agreement.  The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Underwriting Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after
the date of the Underwriting Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Corporation's public disclosures.
 
Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On August 13, 2012, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement, dated August 6, 2012 (the "Contribution Agreement"), among Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership"), the Corporation, El Paso TGPC Investments, L.L.C. ("TGPC Investments") and El Paso EPNG Investments, L.L.C. ("EPNG Investments" and, together with TGPC Investments, the "Contributors"), the Partnership completed the acquisition from the Contributors of (i) 100% of the outstanding equity interests in Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. ("TGPC"), which owns a 13,900-mile pipeline system that transports natural gas from Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and south Texas to the northeastern United States, and (ii) 50% of the outstanding equity interests in El Paso Natural Gas Company ("EPNG"), which owns a 10,200-mile pipeline system that transports natural gas from the San Juan, Permian and Anadarko basins to California, other western states, Texas and northern Mexico (the "Drop-Down Transaction"). The Partnership and the Contributors are subsidiaries of the Corporation. The total consideration was approximately $6.22 billion, including cash of approximately $3.49 billion and the issuance to the Corporation of the Partnership's common units representing limited partner interests having an aggregate value of approximately $387 million. The Partnership also assumed approximately $1.8 billion of debt at TGPC and approximately $560 million of debt at EPNG, which represents 50% of the total debt of EPNG. The Drop-Down Transaction is effective as of August 1, 2012.
 
The terms of the Drop-Down Transaction were unanimously approved on behalf of the Corporation by the independent members of the board of directors of the Corporation.  In approving the Drop-Down Transaction, the independent members of the board of directors of the Corporation based their decision in part on an opinion from the independent financial advisor that the consideration to be paid to the Corporation is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Corporation.
 
The Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries currently own, through the Corporation's general and limited partner interests in the Partnership and its ownership of shares issued by its subsidiary Kinder Morgan Management, LLC, an approximate 12.2% interest in the Partnership, based on the number of limited partner units outstanding as of June 30, 2012.
 
Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
Upon completion of the offering of the Shares described in Item 1.01 above, funds advised by or affiliated with The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings LLC owned less than 2.5% of the voting power of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the election of directors.  As a result, under the shareholders agreement among the Corporation and stockholders referred to as the original investors, The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings LLC no longer have the right to appoint director nominees to the Corporation's board of directors.  In accordance with the shareholders agreement, Mr. R. Baran Tekkora, associated with Riverstone Holdings LLC, and Mr. Glenn A. Youngkin, associated with The Carlyle Group, have therefore tendered their resignations from the Corporation's board, effective as of August 15,
2012, the closing date of the sale of the Shares.  Mr. Tekkora and Mr. Youngkin served on the five member Compensation Committee.
 
In addition, in connection with the reduced ownership of Shares resulting from the sale of Shares by funds advised by or affiliated with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mr. Henry Cornell and Mr. Kenneth A. Pontarelli, both associated with Goldman, Sachs & Co., have elected to tender their resignations from the board effective as of August 15, 2012.
 
As a result of the foregoing sales, the size of the Corporation's board has decreased, and the Corporation now has 11directors.  Further, the provisions in the Corporation's bylaws requiring supermajority board approval of ten directors for certain actions are no longer in effect.
 
None of Messrs. Cornell, Pontarelli, Tekkora or Youngkin resigned because of a disagreement with the Corporation on any matter relating to the Corporation's operations, policies or practices.

(iii)

(c)

(d)
                                
Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Sections 9(a) and 9(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriters, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(c) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Corporation, provided that if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for the indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) counsel for the
 
indemnified party reasonably determines that representation of both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 or Section 10 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(e)
                                 
If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 9(a)(ii) or 9(b)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 9(a)(ii) or 9(b)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
 
10.
                                
Contribution
.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Purchased Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses,
 
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Purchased Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Purchased Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses but after deducting the total underwriting commission received by the Underwriters) received by the Selling Stockholders and the total underwriting commission received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Purchased Securities as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Corporation or such Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Corporation, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Purchased Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Selling Stockholder shall be required to (i) contribute unless such Selling Stockholder would have had indemnification obligations pursuant to subsection (9)(b) above or (ii) contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which such Selling Stockholder's proceeds received by it from the sale of the Purchased Securities pursuant to this Agreement (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before other expenses) exceeds the amount of any damages which such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission; provided, however, this sentence does not modify, limit or reduce (x) the Corporation's agreement to contribute to the full extent provided by clauses (i) and (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 10; (y) with respect to the Corporation's agreement to contribute, the relative benefits received by the Corporation and Selling Stockholders as described in the second sentence of this Section 10; or (z) with respect to the Corporation's agreement to contribute, the relative fault of the Corporation and Selling Stockholders as described in the third sentence of this Section 10. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter and no Underwriter shall be under any liability to the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders, except that (a) if this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders to comply with the terms of this Agreement or because any of the conditions contained in Section 6 of this Agreement, other than Section 6(n) or Sections 6(d)(i), (iii), (iv) or (v), have not been met, the Corporation will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursement of their counsel) reasonably incurred by them and (b) no Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Purchased Securities agreed to be purchased by it hereunder, without some reason sufficient hereunder to justify its cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder, shall be relieved of liability to the Corporation for damages occasioned by its default.

Default of Underwriters

If no such arrangements have been made within 24 hours after the Closing Date, and
 
(a)
                                 
the aggregate number of Purchased Securities to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall not exceed 10% of the total number of Purchased Securities, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase such Purchased Securities on the terms herein set forth in proportion to their respective obligations hereunder, or
 
(b)
                                
the aggregate number of Purchased Securities to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall exceed 10% of the total number of
 
Purchased Securities, the Corporation shall be entitled to an additional period of 24 hours within which to find one or more substitute underwriters satisfactory to the remaining Underwriter or Underwriters to purchase such Purchased Securities, upon the terms set forth herein.
 
In any such case, the Underwriters or the Corporation shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven business days in order that necessary changes and arrangements may be effected.  If the aggregate number of Purchased Securities to be purchased by such defaulting Underwriters shall exceed 10% of the total number of Purchased Securities, and neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Corporation shall make arrangements pursuant to this Section 12 within the period stated for the purchase of the Purchased Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter and without liability on the part of the Corporation or any Selling Stockholder, except, in each case, as provided in Sections 7(k), 9, 10 and 11 hereof.  The provisions of this Section 12 shall not in any way affect the liability of any defaulting Underwriter to the Corporation or the non-defaulting Underwriters arising out of such default.  A substitute underwriter hereunder shall become an Underwriter for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
13.
                                
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship.
  Each of the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Purchased Securities, pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Corporation and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Underwriters is acting solely as a principal and not an agent or fiduciary of the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders, (iii) the Underwriters have not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders on other matters) or any other obligation to the Corporation except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Corporation or the Selling Stockholders and (v) each of the Corporation and each Selling Stockholder has consulted its own legal advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
