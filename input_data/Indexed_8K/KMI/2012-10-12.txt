In accordance with General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
Investment funds affiliated with Goldman, Sachs & Co., The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings LLC (collectively, the "Selling Stockholders") have priced an underwritten public offering (the "Offering") of 69,296,921 shares of Class P common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Kinder Morgan, Inc. ("KMI") pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179812).  The public offering price is $34.15 per share.  The offering is expected to close and settle on October 17, 2012.  It is expected that the Selling Stockholders will sell all of their holdings of KMI common stock in the Offering.  Neither KMI nor KMI's management is selling any shares of common stock in the offering, and KMI will not receive any of the proceeds from the offering of shares by the Selling Stockholders.
