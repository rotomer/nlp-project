CARMAX REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND -------------------------------------- ANNOUNCES FISCAL YEAR 2005 SUPERSTORE OPENING PLANS --------------------------------------------------- Richmond, Va., December 4, 2003 - CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) today reported record third quarter sales for the quarter ended November 30, 2003. o Comparable store used unit sales rose 2% for the quarter. o Total third quarter used unit sales grew 13%. o Total sales increased 14% to $1.07 billion from $936.8 million in the same period last year. o The company continues to expect third quarter earnings per share in the range of 16 cents to 18 cents, with the mid-point of the range being the most likely outcome. o The company announced plans to open approximately 10 used car superstores in the next fiscal year, expanding its superstore base by approximately 20%. Sales Commentary - ---------------- "We are pleased that the quarter's used unit comp sales growth came in at the upper end of our revised expectations," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive officer. "We believe there were two main factors that contributed to the pickup in our comparable store sales rate during the second half of the quarter. First, we reduced our margin targets on selected cars at mid-quarter to improve our price position. Second, we saw wholesale prices decline at a faster pace in October and November, consistent with our expectations. Our newly opened stores continue to perform somewhat above our expectations. "The third quarter, which encompasses the new car model-year changeover period, is always our most volatile and challenging quarter," Ligon said. "In our October 15 release, we noted two probable contributors to the sales slowdown we had seen to that point: o Flatter than normal wholesale prices through mid-October, which meant that some of our used car prices were likely less competitive with new car closeout models than usual. -more-

Page 2 of 4 o A possible return to a more normalized fall seasonality after two exceptionally good fall seasons in fiscal 2002 and 2003, which were driven by sharper-than-normal wholesale pricing declines during the preceding summers. "Based on our internal wholesale pricing data through the end of November, we continue to hold these views," said Ligon. "At this point, it appears that wholesale pricing this year is following a pattern similar to that we observed during fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001. As a result, we expect wholesale prices to bottom out in December as they typically have, and we would expect a relatively normal fourth quarter used car market environment." Third Quarter Earnings Expectations - ----------------------------------- "We expect third quarter earnings per share in the range of 16 to 18 cents, most likely at the midpoint of the range," said Ligon. "This expectation is consistent with the guidance we gave in October." In last year's third quarter, CarMax reported net earnings per share of 14 cents, including 4 cents of costs associated with the separation from Circuit City. "We plan to issue sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year when we release third quarter earnings on December 17," said Ligon. Store Openings - -------------- CarMax opened 2 superstores during the third quarter, entering the Memphis market with a standard superstore and adding a satellite superstore in Glencoe in the Chicago market. The company has opened 6 superstores thus far in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter, CarMax plans to open 2 superstores, entering the Louisville market with a standard superstore and adding a satellite superstore in Las Vegas. In addition, during the fourth quarter, the company expects to co-locate its two remaining stand-alone new car franchises next to a new satellite used car superstore in Los Angeles. Fiscal 2005 Store Opening Plan - ------------------------------ During the fiscal year ending February 28, 2005, the company plans to expand its used car superstore base by approximately 20%, opening approximately 10 used car superstores. Planned entries into new mid-sized markets include Indianapolis, Ind.; Columbia, S.C.; Austin, Tex.; and Albuquerque, N.M. Satellite superstore additions are planned for Winston-Salem, N.C.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Miami, Fla.; and Richmond, Va. CarMax also plans to add a standard superstore and a satellite superstore in the Los Angeles market on sites that were land-banked when the company suspended growth in 1999. -more-
