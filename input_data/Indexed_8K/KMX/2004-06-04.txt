CARMAX REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER SALES ----------------------------------------- Richmond, Va., June 4, 2004 - CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) today reported record sales for the first quarter ended May 31, 2004. o Comparable store used unit sales declined 3% compared with last year's first quarter, consistent with the expectations we set in our May 12th announcement. o Total used unit sales grew 7% in the first quarter. o Total dollar sales increased 13% to $1.32 billion from $1.17 billion in the first quarter of last year. Sales Commentary - ---------------- "The difference between our 13% dollar sales growth and the 7% growth in unit sales was driven primarily by increases in wholesale sales and in average retail prices," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive officer. "Used car sales continued to be volatile during the second half of May. The volatility was felt broadly across virtually all of our used car stores and markets." First Quarter Earnings Expectations - ----------------------------------- "For the first quarter, we continue to expect earnings per share in the range of 30 to 32 cents," Ligon said. "We plan to offer guidance for our second quarter when we release our first quarter earnings report on June 17." Store Openings - -------------- CarMax opened three standard-sized superstores during the first quarter, entering the Indianapolis, Ind., and Columbia, S.C., markets and adding a third superstore in the Los Angeles market. The company plans to open approximately seven superstores during the balance of the fiscal year, bringing total fiscal 2005 store openings to approximately ten.
