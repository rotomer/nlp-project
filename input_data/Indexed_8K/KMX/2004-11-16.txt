CARMAX RAISES COMPARABLE STORE SALES EXPECTATIONS; NOW EXPECTS THIRD QUARTER EPS OF 17(cent) OR 18(cent) Richmond, Va., November 16, 2004 - For the third quarter ending November 30, 2004, CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) today: |X| Raised comparable store used unit performance expectations to growth of 2% or 3%, and |X| Revised earnings per share expectations to 17 cents or 18 cents, which includes a favorable adjustment in the valuation of its retained interests in securitized receivables of approximately 1 cent per share. On September 20, 2004, CarMax had issued third quarter expectations of comparable store used unit performance in the range of -8% to -2% and earnings per share in the range of 12 cents to 17 cents. "Used car sales trends are stronger thus far this quarter than the performance we experienced this summer," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive officer. "Generally we are seeing a typical autumn model-year-changeover period, with used car prices falling in line with historical norms. We may yet see the wholesale market adjust even further than seasonally, helping remove any remaining imbalance in the price gap between used cars and new cars that may be left over from the spring and summer, but that has not yet occurred. "We believe that we also are recovering some of the sales lost to severe weather in Florida and the southeastern United States during August and early September," Ligon said. "DRIVE is contributing approximately 3% to comp sales this quarter. We began testing DRIVE in the fiscal fourth quarter last year. While DRIVE sales are incremental, they contribute much lower gross profit. "Our revised sales and earnings per share estimates reflect our sales trends, which have strengthened through the quarter," said Ligon. "As expected, margins are under pressure because of the seasonal declines in wholesale values and the lower margin contribution on DRIVE-financed sales. We are also experiencing lower service margins and higher-than-forecast SG&A expenses. Store unit bonuses are reflecting the stronger sales we are seeing, and, therefore the store bonuses are higher than we had forecast. "Earnings will benefit from a favorable adjustment to our retained interests in securitized receivables, " Ligon said. "The net loss rates on our more recent securitizations have been trending consistently lower than we assumed. This adjustment will contribute approximately 1 cent to third quarter EPS." -more-
