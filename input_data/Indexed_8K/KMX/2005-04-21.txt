Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement - --------- ------------------------------------------ On April 18, 2005, the Compensation and Personnel Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of CarMax, Inc. (the "Company") established pre-tax net income goals for fiscal year 2006 under the Company's Annual Performance Based Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). The Company maintains the Bonus Plan for its employees, including its named executive officers. Under the Bonus Plan, the Committee fixes pre-tax net income goals for the Company for each fiscal year. Participants receive a predetermined percentage of their base pay as an annual cash bonus depending upon the pre-tax net income level achieved by the Company. On April 18, 2005, the Committee also authorized the payment by the Company of annual cash bonus awards for fiscal year 2005 to the Company's named executive officers under the Bonus Plan. These annual cash bonus awards were earned under the Bonus Plan based upon the achievement of certain fiscal year 2005 pre-tax net income levels, which were previously established by the Committee. However, because the Company failed to fully meet its pre-tax earnings goals for the year, the named executive officers earned and received only a portion of their target bonuses. The annual cash bonus awards for fiscal year 2005 for the Company's named executive officers are set forth in the table below. --------------------------------------- ------------------------ Name and Position 2005 Annual Cash Bonus --------------------------------------- ------------------------ Austin Ligon, President and Chief $412,500 Executive Officer --------------------------------------- ------------------------ Thomas J.
