CarMax, Inc. Page 4 of 9 Business Performance Review - --------------------------- Sales and Earnings. "We are pleased with our earnings growth, particularly in - ------------------- light of sales that were lower than expected in April and May," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive officer. "Our sales pace began to lose some momentum in April and weakened further in May, reflecting a softening used car market environment. We believe some of the same factors that affected the marketplace last spring and summer put pressure on the market this spring, including an atypical rise in wholesale auction prices and higher gas prices. "In April, we began to take steps to counter the current challenges in the market," Ligon said. "We saw prices for low-mileage, late model vehicles at major wholesale auctions increase in an unprecedented fashion this spring. Our analysis suggests that reduced supplies of off-lease cars combined with an unexpected shortage of off-rental cars have been a major factor in these increases. In response, we have not increased our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase in the major wholesale auction market prices. We believe that doing so has helped keep our retail prices more in line with demand, helping to keep our cars attractive to consumers as they compare their options in the new and used car marketplace. We also believe that our appraisal offers are consistent with the broader market trade-in offers, as evidenced by our buy rate, which was ahead of the buy rate for first quarter last year. "We also began to bring our inventories in line with our sales pace, and they are currently where we want them," said Ligon. "Last year, anticipating a stronger summer selling season, we kept our inventories higher than our spring sales pace. If the sales rate increases as this summer progresses, we believe we have sufficient reconditioning capacity to provide replacement units through the summer. "Our 6% growth in comp store used unit sales reflected 3 percentage points added by DRIVE-financed sales," Ligon continued. "The tax-refund seasonal increase in DRIVE sales did not extend into April, as we had originally forecast. Consequently, DRIVE-financed sales were 1 percentage point below our original comp estimates for the quarter, but still in line with the expected overall contribution in the range of 3 to 5% of total sales. "As expected, new vehicle total sales declined, reflecting our disposing of five new car franchises since last year's first quarter," said Ligon. "New vehicle unit comps were flat. Our remaining franchise sales were generally in line with the overall performance of the brands we represent." Margins. "We were within our target range for retail used vehicle gross profit - -------- per car, which declined slightly compared with last year," said Ligon. "Our retail pricing and the higher auction prices put some pressure on used vehicle gross profit. Our in-house wholesale auction prices usually reflect the general wholesale market trends. As a result, our higher in-store auction prices yielded a strong increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per car. The somewhat lower retail margins and higher wholesale margins roughly offset one another, and we achieved total gross profit per car in line with our expectations." CarMax Auto Finance. CarMax Auto Finance income increased to $27.1 million in - -------------------- this year's first quarter from $21.8 million in last year's first quarter. The majority of the increase resulted from a favorable valuation adjustment and the favorable terms of the public securitization completed in April. The current quarter CAF income included a benefit of 2 cents per share from the adjustment - more -
CarMax, Inc. Page 5 of 9 in the valuation of the retained interest in securitized receivables. We lowered the loss assumptions on previously securitized receivables, reflecting the favorable market conditions and the continued excellent performance of CAF's portfolio. CAF's first quarter income also included a benefit of 1 cent per share related to the 2005-1 public securitization. The cost of funds and credit enhancements on this securitization were better than expected as a result of the strong market demand for asset-backed securities, together with CAF's strong portfolio performance. In May 2005, CAF repurchased and subsequently resold into the warehouse facility the remaining receivables related to the 2001-2 public securitization. In May 2004, CAF completed a similar repurchase and resale related to the 2001-1 securitization. Each transaction added approximately 1 cent per share to quarterly earnings. For loans originated and sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the gain was 3.3% compared with 3.8% in last year's first quarter. The reported gain as a percent of all loans sold for the current year's quarter was 4.3%, which includes the effect of the items previously discussed. SG&A. "As we expected, the SG&A ratio at 10.1% was higher than in last year's - ----- first quarter when the ratio was at 9.9%," said Ligon. "The increase reflects primarily the larger percentage of our store base that is made up of stores not yet at base maturity. In this year's first quarter, 45% of our stores were newer stores; in last year's first quarter, that percentage was 35%. The current year's SG&A ratio also reflects the March 30 rollout of marketwide advertising in Los Angeles. We are pleased to report that sales in our Los Angeles stores are strong enough to continue our full marketing program in Los Angeles." Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 Expectations. "The volatility of the used car market - ---------------------------------------- environment has hampered our ability to forecast our performance in the short term," Ligon said. "Consequently, our forecasts for this year's second quarter comp sales and earnings are in wider ranges than we normally would issue. We now believe that second quarter comp store used unit sales will grow in a range of 3% to 9%, with second quarter earnings per share in the range of 29 to 34 cents. These expectations assume continued softness in the used car marketplace, and they also reflect the anniversary of DRIVE's rollout to our entire store base last August. We expect the CAF gain on loans sold will be somewhat below the normalized range of 3.5% to 4.5% as the increase in our cost of funds continues to outpace rises in consumer rates." CarMax plans to release second quarter sales and earnings results on Wednesday, September 21, 2005, before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange. Store Openings. CarMax opened four superstores during the first quarter. We - --------------- expanded our presence in the Los Angeles market, adding both a standard and a satellite superstore, and bringing to five the total store count in this large market. We entered the Jacksonville market with a standard superstore, and we added a satellite superstore in the Kansas City market. CarMax plans to open five additional superstores during the balance of the fiscal year, bringing total fiscal 2006 store openings to nine. - more -
