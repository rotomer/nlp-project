Second Quarter Business Performance Review
Sales
.
 
We had another strong quarter, with solid contributions on many fronts, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. Continued strong traffic and store execution were the primary drivers of our 7% used unit comps. We were particularly pleased with our robust sales performance given the difficult comparison with last years second quarter when we reported 10% comps. Last years quarter benefited from the domestic manufacturers new car employee pricing programs, which drove traffic into the market and created greater pricing transparency.

Wholesale sales climbed reflecting increases in both retail sales and appraisal traffic, said Folliard. New vehicle unit sales were down, reflecting a combination of weaker new car industry trends and our strategic decision to increase targeted gross margin dollars per unit on new vehicles. The increase in other sales and revenues reflected an increase in extended service plan sales in line with our used unit sales growth and an increase in third-party finance fees resulting from a decline in subprime-financed sales.
Margins
.
 
Similar to the first quarter, our used vehicle gross profit per unit benefited from a steady, consistent sales performance, said Folliard. CarMax is a volume-based business, and we systematically cut prices based on our proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance inventory turns and margin achievement. When our sales pace is consistently strong, we take fewer pricing reductions, which in turn maximizes gross profit dollars.
As anticipated, our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased to nearly $700 per unit, reflecting the combined benefits of refinements in our car buying process and increased efficiencies in our in-store auctions over the past couple of years, said Folliard.
CarMax Auto Finance
. CAF income climbed 53% compared with last years second quarter, said Folliard. CAF income benefited from the growth in total sales and managed receivables, an increase in the average amount financed, an improvement in the gain spread, and a favorable valuation adjustment. This years second quarter CAF income included a benefit of 4 cents per share, primarily due to lowering the loss rate assumptions on previously securitized receivables that continue to outperform previous loss estimates. The lower loss rate reflected both fewer defaults and improved recoveries.
The gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans sold was 3.9% in this years second quarter, compared with 3.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, said Folliard. Consumer rates typically lag movements in our funding costs, and the recent pause in interest rate increases allowed our funding costs to remain relatively stable during the second quarter, even as consumer rates continued to rise. The reported gain as a percent of loans sold including the benefit of the favorable item was 4.6% in this years second quarter.
SG&A
. Our SG&A ratio declined to 10.4% compared with 10.5% last year, said Folliard. This quarter we absorbed a nearly 30 basis point increase related to higher share-based compensation costs. This increase was driven, in large part, by the accelerated vesting of stock options this quarter upon the retirement of our former CEO.
As previously reported, CarMax adopted SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and results for the prior year have been restated to enhance comparability. SFAS 123R requires all share-based compensation to be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. CarMax recognized $13.1 million of share-based compensation expense ($8.1 million net of taxes) in the second quarter of the current year, including $12.5 million reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses, compared with $6.2 million ($3.8 million net of taxes) in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, all of which is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Earnings
. We are very pleased to have two back-to-back quarters where we experienced broad-based strength, said Folliard. Earnings per share for the first half of the year were up 47%, with across-the-board contributions related to used and wholesale sales and gross profits, CAF, and SG&A leverage.

Store Openings
No new superstores were opened during the second quarter. CarMax plans to open two standard superstores and four satellite superstores during the balance of the fiscal year, bringing total fiscal 2007 store openings to ten. Normal construction delays have shifted the planned opening date of the companys third used car superstore in the Charlotte, N.C., market into the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This store was previously expected to open in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fiscal 2007 Expectations
Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we believe it is appropriate to refine our comparable store used unit growth expectations and to increase our earnings per share expectations for the current fiscal year, said Folliard. We now expect annual used unit comp growth in the range of 6% to 8%. Fiscal 2007 used unit comps were previously expected to be in the range of 2% to 8%.
We now expect fiscal 2007 earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, representing EPS growth in the range of 23% to 31%, compared with the $1.26 reported in fiscal 2006 after restatement for SFAS 123R, continued Folliard. This revised range includes an estimated 19 or 20 cents per share of share-based compensation expense, compared with 13 cents per share recognized in the restated fiscal 2006 results. The revised range also includes the 7 cents per share of favorable CAF items reported in the first half of this year, while last years results included 9 cents per share of favorable CAF items. Fiscal 2007 earnings per share were previously expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.47.
Our revised expectations assume that we dont experience abnormal winter weather events, said Folliard. Our outlook also assumes a decline in gross profit dollars per wholesale unit in the second half of the year compared with the unusually high levels reported in the second half of fiscal 2006. And, we now expect CAFs gain spread to be in the range of 3.7% to 4.0% in the second half of the year, assuming no significant changes in the interest rate environment.
