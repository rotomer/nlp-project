Increase in Commitments.
 
(a)
 
Request for Increase
. Provided there exists no Default and there has been no prior reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Company may, from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $100,000,000;
provided
that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, (ii) no such increase shall result in any increase in the Letter of Credit Sublimit, Swing Line Sublimit or the New Vehicle Swing Line Sublimit
, and (iii) the Company may make a maximum of three such requests
. At the time of sending such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).
 
(b)
 
Lender Elections to Increase
. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. No Lender shall be obligated to increase its Commitment upon the Companys request pursuant to this
Section 2.16
.
 
(c)
 
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders
. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To the extent (i) one or more Lenders have declined to increase their respective Commitments or have agreed to increase their respective Commitments by an amount less than their respective Applicable Percentages of a requested increase and (ii) one or more Lenders have agreed to increase their respective Commitments by an amount greater than their respective Applicable Percentages of such requested increase, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, allocate the Commitments that would otherwise have been allocated to the Lenders described in clause (i) above to one or more of the Lenders described in clause (ii) above. To the extent the Lenders have not agreed to increase their respective Commitments in an amount sufficient to provide the full amount of a requested increase, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders in order to provide, together with the existing Lenders increasing their Commitments, the aggregate requested additional Commitments. In order to become a Lender, each such additional Eligible Assignee shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
 
 
4
 
(d)
 
Effective Date and Allocations
. If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the 
Increase Effective Date
) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.
 
(e)
 
Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase
. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Company and the Borrowers, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Borrowers contained in
Article V
and the representations and warranties of each Loan Party contained in each other Loan Document are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.16
, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of
Section 5.05
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of

, and (B) no Default exists. On each Increase Effective Date, (i) each relevant Lender that is increasing its Commitment shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other relevant Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the application of such amounts to make payments to such other relevant Lenders, the outstanding Committed Loans (and risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans, New Vehicle Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations) to be held ratably by all Lenders in accordance with their respective revised Applicable Percentages, and (ii) the Revolving Borrower shall be deemed to have prepaid and reborrowed the outstanding Committed Loans as of such Increase Effective Date to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section.

(n)
 
Liens on Vehicles purchased directly from consumers or on specific property acquired pursuant to an Acquisition permitted by
Section 7.10
,
provided
that (i) such Liens were in existence at the time of such purchase or Acquisition, (ii) no such Lien extends to any property other than the property purchased or
 
 
6
