Richmond, Va. December 20, 2006 - CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2006.
Third Quarter
 
Business Performance Review
We are very pleased to announce stronger-than-anticipated third quarter results, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. Similar to the first half of the year, we experienced widespread strength as reflected in our retail and wholesale sales and profit margins, CAFs performance, and the overhead leverage achieved.
Sales
. We are especially pleased with our robust sales performance, said Folliard. Used unit comps climbed 13%, driven by a combination of strong store and Internet traffic, and continued excellent execution by our store teams. It is difficult to attribute our strong traffic flow to any single factor, as we believe a number of elements had a positive effect. We believe one contributing factor was our increased Internet visibility resulting from recent improvements to carmax.com and the expansion of our Internet classified advertising. We continued to see a rebound in sales of SUVs and trucks, which were adversely affected last year by consumer reaction to higher gas prices. Sales of luxury vehicles also continued to comprise a larger percentage of our sales.

As a result of strong growth in wholesale units, our wholesale sales expanded by nearly 30% in this years third quarter, said Folliard. The increase in wholesale units reflected the growth in our store base and a substantial increase in appraisal traffic, in part spurred by the strong increase in retail sales.
Gross Profit
. Historically, our margins have been seasonally weakest in the third quarter, due to the effects of the model year changeover period and slowing customer traffic in the fall, said Folliard. This quarter we are pleased to report a year-over-year increase in gross profit dollars per unit in all categories, including used, new, and wholesale vehicles, as well as in other sales and revenues. Similar to the first half of the year, our used vehicle profits benefited from our steady, consistent sales performance, resulting in fewer pricing reductions. While we had anticipated that our wholesale gross profit per unit would decline compared with the unusually strong level reported last year in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we nevertheless achieved a modest improvement. The continuing success of our car-buying strategies benefited both our used retail and our wholesale gross profits per unit.
CarMax Auto Finance
. We had another quarter of solid performance at CAF, said Folliard. CAF income rose 14 percent, to $32.0 million, despite the challenging comparison with last years quarter, which included $6.1 million, or 3 cents per share net of taxes, of favorable items. As in the first half of this year, CAF benefited from our strong sales performance, an increase in the average amount financed, and an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold.
The gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans sold increased to 4.3% in this years third quarter compared with 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We had expected a gain in the range of 3.7% to 4.0%, said Folliard. The relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve a better-than-expected gain percentage.
SG&A
. This quarters improvement in fixed overhead leverage was generated by our strong comparable store sales growth, said Folliard. The SG&A ratio declined 120 basis points, to 10.6% in this years quarter compared with 11.8% in last years quarter. The SG&A ratio benefited modestly from a shift in the timing of certain planned spending, which we now expect to incur in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
As previously reported, CarMax adopted SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and results for the prior year have been restated to enhance comparability. SFAS 123R requires all share-based compensation to be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. CarMax recognized $6.1 million, or 3 cents per share, of share-based compensation cost in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, including $5.6 million reflected in SG&A, compared with $5.6 million, or 3 cents per share, in last years third quarter, all of which was included in SG&A.
Earnings
. We are gratified to report that from virtually every standpoint, the first nine months of this year have proven exceptional and reflect the increasing success of our long-term business strategy, said Folliard. Given our many opportunities for geographic expansion, we remain excited about our long-term prospects.
Superstore Openings
We opened two superstores in late November: a satellite superstore in the Los Angeles, Calif., market; and a standard superstore in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is part of the Washington, D.C., television market. In the first nine months of fiscal 2007, we opened six superstores, including four standard superstores and two satellite superstores. We plan to open four additional superstores during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

Earnings Highlights
Fiscal 2007 Expectations
Given our strong third quarter results, we believe that it is appropriate to increase our fiscal 2007 comparable store used unit growth and earnings per share expectations, said Folliard. The company now projects comparable store used unit growth in the range of 8% to 9%, an increase from the most recent guidance of 6% to 8%.
The company now expects fiscal 2007 EPS in the range of $1.75 to $1.85, representing growth in the range of 39% to 47%, compared with EPS of $1.26 in fiscal 2006 (after restatement for SFAS 123R). This revised range includes an estimated 19 or 20 cents per share of share-based compensation expense, compared with 13 cents per share recognized in the restated fiscal 2006 results. The revised range also includes the 7 cents per share of favorable CAF items reported in the first nine months of this year, while fiscal 2006 full years results included 9 cents per share of favorable CAF items. Fiscal 2007 EPS was previously expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65.
As always, our projections were not adjusted for the possibility of unusual winter weather, which could adversely affect our fourth quarter results, said Folliard. In the fourth quarter, we expect the opportunity for SG&A leverage will be limited by the combination of significantly higher store pre-opening costs in this years quarter, the shift in timing of certain spending from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and the challenging comparison to last year when we benefited from unexpectedly favorable healthcare and property tax costs.
Fiscal 2008 Superstore Opening Plan
During the fiscal year ending February 28, 2008, we expect to open 13 used car superstores, including 5 standard superstores and 8 satellite superstores. These store openings will expand our used car superstore base by approximately 17%, consistent with our target for used car superstore annual growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Planned store openings are as follows:

Our store opening plan for next year is fairly balanced, said Folliard. Well be entering five new markets and expanding our presence in six existing markets, geographically dispersed across the country. The opening plan also contains a mix of market sizes, ranging from San Diego, which is our first new large market in several years, to markets such as Omaha and Jackson.
