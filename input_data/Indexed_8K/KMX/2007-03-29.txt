Richmond, Va., March 29, 2007 - CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the effect of the 2-for-1 stock split on March 26, 2007.
Fourth Quarter Business Performance Review
Weve had a great year at CarMax and are pleased to wrap up fiscal 2007 with another quarter of solid performance, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.
Sales
. We posted our second consecutive quarter of double-digit used unit comp growth, up 12% in the fourth quarter, said Folliard. Similar to the first nine months of the year, we benefited from strong store and Internet traffic and continued excellent execution by our store teams. Compared with earlier quarters of this year, our average used vehicle selling price moderated slightly in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of last year, our average selling price reflected the rebound in SUV and truck sales, which had been adversely affected by the spike in gasoline prices earlier that year.
Wholesale vehicle sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter, as the increase in unit sales was offset by a decline in our average wholesale selling price. We believe the decline in wholesale price reflects the difficult comparison with last years fourth quarter. Our wholesale selling prices were unusually strong in the second half of last year, due in part to the large number of vehicles destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which caused a supply/demand imbalance, particularly for older, higher mileage cars that make up the majority of our wholesale sales.

Gross Profit
. Our total gross profit per unit of $2,651 was slightly below the prior years quarter, primarily because of a $60 per unit decline in wholesale vehicle profits. As expected, our wholesale profit per unit was lower than in last years fourth quarter, which had benefited from the unusually strong demand and pricing for older cars in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. However, our wholesale profit per unit did strengthen compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2007, as we typically generate our highest wholesale margins in the fourth quarter when the seasonal demand for older, higher mileage cars normally peaks.
CarMax Auto Finance
. We again reported strong financial results at CarMax Auto Finance, said Folliard. CAF income rose 25%, to $31.7 million, despite the 1 cent per share of favorable valuation adjustments recorded last year. CAF income benefited from our strong sales performance and an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold.
The gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold (the gain percentage) increased to 4.0% in this years fourth quarter compared with 3.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Over the long-term, we expect our gain percentage to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We were at or below the lower end of this range throughout fiscal 2006. Our gain percentage began returning to more normalized levels last summer, coincident with the general stabilization in our funding costs.
SG&A
. The SG&A ratio increased 10 basis points to 10.7% from 10.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. As expected, we had significantly higher pre-opening costs in this years fourth quarter due to differences in the timing of store openings. In addition, this years fourth quarter SG&A expense included an impairment charge of approximately $4.9 million, or 1 cent per share, related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new car franchises. Excluding the impairment loss and assuming pre-opening costs at a level similar to the prior year, we estimate the SG&A ratio would have declined approximately 30 basis points versus last years fourth quarter.
As previously reported, we adopted the new accounting rules for stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and results for the prior year were restated to enhance comparability. We recognized $6.5 million, or 2 cents per share, of share-based compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, $5.9 million of which was included in SG&A, compared with $6.1 million, or 2 cents per share, in last years fourth quarter, all of which was included in SG&A.
Superstore Openings
. We opened four stores during the fourth quarter: a standard superstore in Fresno; satellite superstores in Austin and East Haven; and a satellite superstore in Charlottesville, Va., which was our first entry into a small market. We adjusted our store footprint, inventory level, and staffing model in Charlottesville to accommodate the expected smaller aggregate sales opportunity in this market. We believe this store will help us better understand our long-term opportunities in smaller markets, as well as having possible application in larger markets in fill-in situations or where real estate availability is constrained. For the fiscal year, we opened a total of ten superstores, including five standard and five satellite superstores, expanding our store base by 15%.

Fiscal 2008 Expectations
Superstore Openings and Capital Expenditures
. We plan to expand our used car superstore base by approximately 17% in fiscal 2008, opening 13 used car superstores, including 5 standard and 8 satellite superstores. We plan to enter five new markets and expand our presence in six existing markets. The fiscal 2008 store opening plan contains a mix of market sizes, ranging from San Diego, which is our first new larger market in several years, to Omaha and Jackson, Miss.
In fiscal 2008, we also plan to open three additional car buying centers, in the Raleigh, Tampa, and Dallas markets. These sites will expand a test begun in fiscal 2007, when we opened our first car buying center in the Atlanta market. These test stores are part of our longer-term efforts to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency.
We currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately $300 million in fiscal 2008. Planned expenditures primarily relate to new store construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings. Compared with the approximately $192 million spent in fiscal 2007, the fiscal 2008 capital spending estimate reflects more real estate purchases for future development in larger, multi-store markets. In addition, the fiscal 2007 capital spending amount was lower than originally projected, due in part to the acquisition of some store sites pursuant to ground lease.

Fiscal 2008 Sales
. We currently anticipate comparable store used unit growth for fiscal 2008 in the range of 3% to 9%, said Folliard. We also expect wholesale unit sales growth to be consistent with our total used unit sales increase. Total revenues are expected to climb by between 14% and 20%, reflecting our expectations for used unit comp growth, new store openings, a modest increase in used vehicle average selling price, and a continued decline in our new vehicle sales.
Fiscal 2008 Earnings Per Share
. We currently anticipate fiscal 2008 earnings per share in the range of $1.03 to $1.14, representing EPS growth in the range of 12% to 24%, said Folliard. We expect modest improvement in both used vehicle and wholesale gross profits per unit in fiscal 2008, as we continue to refine and improve our car-buying processes.
We expect CAF income to increase modestly, but at a pace slower than anticipated sales growth, primarily reflecting the headwind created by the $13 million of favorable CAF items reported in fiscal 2007, continued Folliard. The CAF gain percentage is anticipated to be slightly above the midpoint of our normalized 3.5% to 4.5% range in fiscal 2008, assuming no significant change in the interest rate environment.
We expect to begin generating SG&A leverage with comparable store used unit sales growth at the midpoint of our expectation range, said Folliard. This expectation reflects an increase in planned SG&A spending to support strategic, operational, and Internet initiatives, as well as an increase in pre-opening costs for the larger number of planned store openings.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be similar to the fiscal 2007 rate, said Folliard. However, our diluted share count is expected to increase by approximately 3%, reflecting the effects of the recent increase in our stock price and option exercises on the weighted average share calculation.
