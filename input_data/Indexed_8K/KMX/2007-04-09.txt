Rick had the vision to revolutionize the automotive retail industry with the unique CarMax consumer offer while he was president and chief executive officer of Circuit City, said Tom Folliard, CarMax president and chief executive officer. On behalf of all CarMax associates, let me express our gratitude to him for the role he played in helping CarMax become the nations largest retailer of used cars.

He is currently the chairman of the board of Crocs, Inc. and a director of Flextronics International.
Mr. Tiefel, age 73, has served on our board of directors since 2002 and as our independent lead director since May 2006. He is retired vice-chairman of Marriott International, Inc. and chairman emeritus of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C.
