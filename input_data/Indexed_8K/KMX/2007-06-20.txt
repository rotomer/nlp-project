Richmond, Va., June 20, 2007  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported record first quarter results for the quarter ended May 31, 2007.
First Quarter Business Performance Review
.  Comparable store used unit sales growth of 6% kicked off another good first quarter and what we are confident will be another year of growth for CarMax, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  We are pleased with our sales performance this quarter, particularly given what we believe was a somewhat weak retail environment and the fact that we were up against 6% comparable store used unit sales growth in the first quarter of each of the last two years.  Broad-based increases in traffic, both in our stores and on our website, and solid execution by our store teams continued to positively affect our results.  Credit availability via CarMax Auto Finance and our third-party finance providers remained consistent with prior quarters, also enabling our strong sales performance.  We believe we continued to gain share in the late-model used vehicle market.
Sales
Wholesale unit sales increased 7%, in line with our expectations and reflecting the challenging comparison with the first quarter of last year when wholesale unit sales grew by 21%.  Other sales and revenues climbed 11%, supported by an 18% increase in the sales of extended service plans and a 10% net increase in third-party finance fees.
.Our total gross profit per retail unit of $2,801 was up modestly from the prior years first quarter, with an improvement in wholesale gross profit per unit largely offset by a reduction in new vehicle profits.  Our average gross profit per unit on our retail used cars was slightly higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and it climbed from the fourth quarter level primarily as a result of normal seasonal trends.  The increase in wholesale gross profit per unit reflected the continuation of our multi-year efforts to improve both our car-buying process and our in-store auctions.

.  We had another strong quarter at CAF, said Folliard.  CAF income climbed 14%, despite the inclusion of approximately $6 million of favorable items in last years first quarter.  CAF benefited from our solid sales growth, an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold, and the increase in total managed receivables.
CarMax Auto Finance
The gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans sold increased to 4.2% in this years first quarter compared with 3.4% in the first quarter of last year.  Since last year, we have been able to gradually increase the rates charged to consumers to reflect previous increases in our own cost of funds.  Over the long-term, we continue to expect that our gain percentage will generally be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
As a result of our normal quarterly review of the valuation of our retained interest in securitized receivables, we recorded an immaterial favorable valuation adjustment in the quarter.  While the loss trend on receivables originated since late 2005 has been higher than on receivables originated in 2003 and 2004, the higher losses were expected and were already incorporated into our existing loss assumptions.  The receivables originated in these earlier years experienced losses well below both CAFs historical averages and our targeted loss rates.  Following a period of testing and validation, CAF gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2005 in order to maximize originations while remaining within targeted loss rates.
.  Our SG&A ratio was modestly unfavorable in this years first quarter, at 10.0% compared with 9.9% in the corresponding quarter last year.  As expected, our SG&A spending this year related to planned strategic, operational, and Internet initiatives precluded achieving overhead leverage from our sales growth.
SG&A
.  Net income increased by 15% to $65.4 million, from $56.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  As expected, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 3%, primarily as a result of stock option exercises in fiscal 2007 and the effect of the increase in our stock price on the calculation of fully diluted common shares.  As a result, earnings per share increased at a slower pace than the growth in net income.
Earnings and Earnings Per Share
. During the first quarter, we opened three used car superstores, entering the Tucson market with a standard superstore, and the Milwaukee market with two satellite superstores.  Vehicle reconditioning for the Milwaukee satellites is provided by our standard superstore in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has available capacity.  We also opened a car-buying center in the Raleigh market, expanding the test we began last year in Atlanta.  The car-buying centers focus on appraisals and vehicle purchases and are part of our long-term effort to increase vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency.  We plan to open an additional ten used car superstores and two car-buying centers during the remainder of fiscal 2008.
