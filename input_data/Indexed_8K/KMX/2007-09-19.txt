Richmond, Va., September 19, 2007  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the second quarter ended August 31, 2007.
$54.3 million, or 25 cents per diluted share, earned in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Second Quarter Business Performance Review
.  Despite missing our sales targets for the first half of the year, we were relatively pleased with our sales performance, given the context of the current macro-economic conditions and the challenging automotive retail environment over the past few months, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer of CarMax.  While our 3% increase in comparable store used unit sales represents a deceleration in our growth rate compared with recent quarters, we believe that we nevertheless continued to gain share in the late-model used vehicle market during the quarter.
Sales
Our sales growth was supported by increases in traffic, both in our stores and on our website, and the continued consistent availability of credit from CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) and our third-party finance providers.  During the second quarter, we opened one used car superstore in Torrance, California, our seventh store in the Los Angeles market.
Wholesale unit sales increased 15% in the second quarter, somewhat greater than the 11% increase in total retail used unit sales, reflecting the easier relative comparison with the second quarter of last year.  Other sales and revenues rose 10%, supported by a 14% increase in extended service plan revenues and an 11% net increase in third-party finance fees.
New vehicle unit sales declined by 15%, reflecting the combination of softer new car industry sales trends and the August divestiture of our Orlando Chrysler Jeep Dodge franchise.  Following this divestiture, we now operate six new car franchises.

.  Total gross profit per retail unit climbed to $2,869 in this years second quarter compared with $2,755 in last years quarter.  The majority of the increase was attributable to an improvement in wholesale gross profit per unit to $796, up $97 compared with last years second quarter.  Wholesale profit was relatively consistent with the $800 per unit reported in this years first quarter, however.  The wholesale operation continued to benefit from our superior car-buying process, as well as continued strong dealer attendance at our auctions.
Gross Profit
.  CAF income decreased approximately 8% to $33.4 million compared with $36.5 million in last years second quarter.  In the prior year period, CAF income included approximately $6 million of favorable adjustments, primarily related to lowering loss rate assumptions on loans originated in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Excluding the effect of adjustments, CAF income increased 9%, reflecting our retail sales growth, a slight improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold from 3.9% last year to 4.0% in the current quarter, and an increase in total managed receivables.
CarMax Auto Finance
.  The SG&A ratio improved to 10.1% in this years second quarter compared with 10.4% in the corresponding quarter of last year.  Last years second quarter SG&A ratio included the effect of approximately $5 million of share-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock options held by our former chief executive officer upon his retirement.  Excluding the effect of the accelerated vesting, last years second quarter SG&A ratio would have been 10.1%.
SG&A
.  The effective tax rate increased to 39.5% in the current quarter compared with 38.2% in the second quarter of last year.  The higher effective tax rate, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.01 per share, was primarily the result of the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.
Income Taxes
.  Although our comparable store used unit sales growth was slower than in recent quarters, the improvement in our gross profit per unit allowed us to increase earnings at a rate higher than our sales growth, said Folliard.

Fiscal 2008 Expectations
Our sales and profits for the first half of the fiscal year fell short of our original expectations, said Folliard.  We believe this is largely the result of the current market environment and the industry-wide slowdown in auto sales.  While it is difficult to predict how long the current conditions may persist, we believe it is appropriate to revise our expectations for comparable store used unit sales growth and earnings per share for the current fiscal year.  Our revisions assume that the current trends will continue for the remainder of the fiscal year.
We now expect annual comparable store used unit sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, compared with the 9% increase achieved in fiscal 2007.  Fiscal 2008 used unit comps were previously expected to be in the range of 3% to 9%.

We now expect fiscal 2008 earnings per share in the range of $0.92 to $0.98, compared with the $0.92 per share reported in fiscal 2007.  Fiscal 2008 earnings per share were previously expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.14.
Our new fiscal 2008 expectations reflect:
Although we are clearly disappointed with the revised outlook for fiscal 2008, we believe the downward revisions to our earnings outlook are largely related to external factors, said Folliard.  We believe we have a superior business model for automotive retailing, and we plan to continue investing to support our long-term growth initiatives.  We plan to continue adding stores at our 15% to 20% stated annual growth rate and fully expect to gain market share regardless of the external environment.
Future Store Opening Plan
In the second half of fiscal 2008, we plan to open an additional nine used car superstores, one of which was opened in early September.  This will bring the total fiscal 2008 store openings to 13, representing a 17% increase in our store base.  In addition, we plan to expand our car-buying center test with the opening of our third and fourth centers, including one in Dallas and one in Tampa.  At the car-buying centers, we conduct appraisals and purchase cars but do not sell vehicles.  These test stores are part of our long-term program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency.
In the first half of fiscal 2009, we currently plan to open eight used car superstores, as follows:
Normal construction, permitting, or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates of any of these stores into a later period.
