RICHMOND, Va.  August 6, 2008  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported that comparable store used unit sales declined by an average of 17% for the months of June and July.  As reported in June, the sudden and dramatic drop-off in our sales beginning Memorial Day weekend caused us to withdraw our previous sales and earnings guidance for the fiscal year, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  Through Thursday, May 22, our comparable store used unit sales for the month of May were slightly below our expectations, but they were still a positive 1%.  From Memorial Day weekend through the end of May, however, comparable store used unit sales declined by 5 percentage points.  The slowdown in customer traffic and sales closely followed the sharp rise in gasoline prices, which topped $4.00 per gallon nationally in early June.  In June, our customer traffic and comparable store used unit sales eroded further, and July was somewhat weaker still, resulting in an average decline in comparable store used unit sales of 17% for the two months.
As a result of these unprecedented declines, we have made dramatic reductions in our used vehicle inventory levels in June and July to bring them in line with the lower current sales rate and have adjusted the vehicle mix to reflect changes in consumer preferences.  Compared with inventory levels of stores open at May 31, 2008, we reduced our used vehicle inventory by approximately 9,500 units as of July 31, representing $150 million.  In addition, we have been aggressive in reducing our variable store staffing levels (primarily through scheduling and attrition), are reevaluating all open positions and are continuing to focus on controlling overhead expenses.
As a result of the current environment and in order to enhance profitability, we have decided to temporarily slow our store growth, said Folliard.  Historically, our earnings have funded a significant portion of our store growth, and the current slowdown in customer traffic and sales is pressuring this source of funding.  We expect to open one additional store, in Hickory, North Carolina, in fiscal 2009, which will bring us to a total of ten store openings for the current fiscal year.  The remaining four stores originally planned to be opened late in fiscal 2009 will be pushed into fiscal 2010, when we plan to open a total of between five and ten stores.  With the temporary slowdown in store growth, we now expect gross capital expenditures will total between $225 million and $250 million in fiscal 2009.  Previously, we expected gross capital expenditures to total approximately $350 million in the current year.  We remain committed to our long-term growth plan; however, we are slowing growth on a temporary basis in order to achieve our long-term objectives.
While this is clearly a difficult environment for us, we remain confident in our superior consumer offer and our long-term growth opportunity, said Folliard.
