Richmond, Va., June 19, 2009  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2009.
First Quarter Business Performance Review
.  While our customer traffic trend continued to be weak, we did see improvement in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  On a year-over-year basis, sales execution improved notably, which partially offset the decline in traffic.  In this difficult environment, superior in-store execution becomes even more critical, said Folliard.  We are pleased to see our store teams executing at a high level, despite the tough environment.  The improvement in execution occurred even as we decided to continue our strategy, begun in the fall of 2008, to slow the rate of CAF loan originations.  We believe the reduction in the percentage of sales financed by CAF contributed modestly to the decline in comparable store sales.
Sales
Our wholesale unit sales declined 25% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2009.  The decline primarily reflected continued depressed levels of appraisal traffic, partly offset by a slight improvement in our buy rate compared with the prior years quarter.  We believe the recent upward trend in industry wholesale prices and the resulting increase in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the buy rate.

Other sales and revenues declined 4% versus those reported in the first quarter of last year.  Extended service plan revenues decreased 5%.  Service department sales increased 9%, reflecting higher service-related customer traffic.  Third-party finance fees declined 42%, primarily reflecting a mix shift among providers, as well as the lower retail unit sales.
.Total gross profit declined 2% to $276.2 million from $282.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, despite the 17% decline in total revenues.  The effect of the decline in unit sales was largely offset by an improvement in our total gross profit dollars per retail unit, which increased $347 per unit to $2,911 in the current quarter from $2,564 in the corresponding prior year period.  
Gross Profit
 
 
Used vehicle gross profit per unit increased to $2,001 per unit from $1,742 per unit in the prior year quarter.  In part, this improvement reflected the below-average profitability reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, when the initial slowdown in customer traffic and the rapid decline in underlying wholesale values of SUVs and trucks put pressure on our used vehicle margins.  The improvement also reflected benefits realized from our initiatives to reduce vehicle reconditioning costs.
Wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased to $904 per unit from $784 per unit in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.  The strong industry wholesale price appreciation in the last several months contributed to the increased per-unit contribution, as did the strong dealer-to-car ratio experienced at our auctions.
.  CAF reported a loss of $21.6 million compared with income of $9.8 million in the first quarter of the prior year.  In both periods, CAF results were reduced by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, these adjustments totaled $40.4 million, and they included:
CarMax Auto Finance
 
 
The unfavorable adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 totaled $20.0 million and they related to increased funding costs on the $845 million of loans that were securitized in the warehouse facility at the end of fiscal 2008.
Excluding these adjustments from both periods, CAF income declined to $18.8 million from $29.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.  CAFs gain on loans originated and sold was $3.1 million in the current quarter versus $17.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher estimated warehouse facility credit enhancements and funding costs, a decline in loan origination volume, and the use of a higher discount rate assumption.  The volume of CAF loans originated and sold fell 27% from the prior years quarter, reflecting both the decline in used unit sales and our decision to decrease the percentage of sales financed by CAF.

Based on conditions in the credit markets, we anticipate that the warehouse facility funding costs and credit enhancement levels will increase upon its renewal or replacement in July, after which they will more closely align with the current funding costs and enhancement levels in the public securitization market.  We reflected these estimated higher warehouse costs and enhancements in the gain recognized on all loans originated and sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced to $206.2 million, or 11.2% of total revenues, from $243.0 million, or 11.0% of total revenues in the prior year quarter.  The SG&A reductions included decreases in variable selling expenses, including payroll, and decreases in growth-related costs, including pre-opening and relocation costs resulting from our decision to temporarily suspend store growth.  We also decided to sharply curtail our advertising spend in this environment.  In addition, the current quarter SG&A expenses included the benefit of a favorable litigation settlement, which increased net earnings by $0.02 per share, while the prior years first quarter SG&A expenses included accrued litigation costs, which reduced net earnings by $0.02 per share.
SG&A
  We are pleased to report earnings similar to the prior year level, despite being in the midst of the most challenging economic and credit environments in our history, said Folliard.  In many regards, our performance was the result of our focus on increasing operational effectiveness and reducing waste.  We are especially pleased with our ability to improve inventory turns and to maintain or improve our gross profit per unit during the last several quarters, which is a testament to the strength of our car-buying and inventory management processes, as well as some early returns from our reconditioning waste reduction initiatives.
Net Earnings.
.  As of May 31, 2009, we had net debt of $284.0 million, consisting of $389.1 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $28.5 million of capitalized leases, net of $133.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.  At that date, based on then-current inventory levels, we had additional borrowing capacity of $187.7 million under the revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2011.
Credit Facilities
As of May 31, 2009, $636.0 million of auto loan receivables were outstanding in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled $764.0 million.  The warehouse facility has an annual term, and it expires in July 2009.  We are currently working on the renewal or replacement of this facility, which is used as the initial funding source for CAF auto loans.
