Item 8.01.              Other Events.
On August 7, 2009, CarMax, Inc. renewed its warehouse facility for another 364 day term.  The facility limit was reduced to $1.2 billion from $1.4 billion.  As of August 7, 2009, unused warehouse capacity totaled $768 million.  The funding cost spread in the renewed warehouse facility is higher than the spread in the previous facility but favorable to the estimated spread used in the calculation of the gain on loans originated and sold for the quarter ended May 31, 2009.  The warehouse facility is used to securitize auto loan receivables originated by CarMax Auto Finance.
