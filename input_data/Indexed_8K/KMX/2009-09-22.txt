Richmond, Va., September 22, 2009  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the second quarter ended August 31, 2009.
Second Quarter Business Performance Review
.  We are pleased to report healthy increases in both used and wholesale vehicle unit sales, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  In part, the sales growth was the result of easier year-over-year comparisons; however, it also reflected improving customer traffic trends and an improvement in sales execution.  While customer traffic in the second quarter remained slightly below the prior year level, it has steadily strengthened throughout the first half of the current fiscal year.  The governments CARS, or cash for clunkers, program resulted in a spike in traffic in late July and August.  Similar to our experience with previous successful, broad-based new car incentive programs, we believe this program had a beneficial effect on our sales.
Sales
The improvement in sales execution occurred despite a further tightening of CAF lending standards implemented at the start of this years second quarter.  We believe several factors may have contributed to the improvement in the sales conversion rate, including the effects of our new sales training initiatives and increased inventory levels, as well as having a larger percentage of motivated buyers.  We estimate the combined effect of the tightening in CAF lending standards in the second half of fiscal 2009 and in the current year adversely affected second quarter comparable store used unit sales growth by several percentage points.  The current quarter tightening, which we expect to significantly reduce loss rates, was implemented to reduce the credit enhancements associated with future CAF securitizations.

Our wholesale unit sales increased 5% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2009.  While our appraisal traffic improved from the first quarter, it remained significantly below the prior years second quarter.  However, we experienced a substantial improvement in our appraisal buy rate, which more than offset the lower appraisal traffic.  We believe the strong industry wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers, together with the increased percentage of motivated buyers, had a favorable effect on the buy rate.
.  Total gross profit increased 23% to $314.5 million from $255.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, reflecting the combination of the increase in unit sales plus an improvement in total gross profit dollars per retail unit, which increased $363 per unit to $3,116 in the current quarter from $2,753 in the corresponding prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit increased to $2,120 per unit from $1,870 per unit in the prior year quarter.  The improvement resulted from a combination of factors, including the continued appreciation in used car wholesale values since January 2009, an increase in our inventory turns and the robust sales environment experienced in the quarter.
Wholesale gross profit per unit declined to $826 in the current quarter, compared with $897 in the second quarter of last year, primarily reflecting the challenging comparison with the prior year period.  Other gross profit increased to $551 per unit from $385 per unit in the second quarter of last year.  Service department profits grew because our retail sales growth outpaced fixed service overhead costs, and extended service plan profits benefited from the successful introduction of a guaranteed asset protection product.
.  CAF reported income of $72.1 million compared with a loss of $7.1 million in last years second quarter.  In both periods, CAF results were affected by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the adjustments increased CAF income by $36.2 million and they included:
CarMax Auto Finance
In the second quarter of last year, the adjustments reduced CAF income by $28.2 million, which included $15.7 million related to increases in cumulative net loss rate assumptions, $7.7 million of mark-to-market write-downs and $4.1 million resulting from an increase in the discount rate assumption.
Excluding these adjustments from both periods, CAF income increased to $36.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 from $21.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.  CAFs gain on loans originated and sold was $19.9 million, or 4.2% of loans originated and sold, in the current quarter versus $9.4 million, or 1.8%, in the prior year quarter.  Compared with the prior year period, the increase in the gain as a percentage of loans originated and sold reflected an increase in the spread between the rates charged customers and CAFs funding cost, primarily due to lower benchmark rates.  In addition, the increase in the credit quality of the loans originated in the quarter resulted in reduced credit enhancement requirements for these loans.

.  Selling, general and administrative expenses declined to $218.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 from $225.1 million in the prior years quarter, despite the increase in unit sales.  The decline was primarily the result of lower levels of advertising spending and decreases in growth-related costs.  The SG&A ratio improved to 10.5% in the current year quarter compared with 12.2% in the prior year quarter, due to both the reduction in absolute SG&A spending and the leverage associated with the increases in used unit sales and average selling prices.
SG&A
.  We are extremely pleased to report a record level of quarterly income, despite the continued challenging economic environment, said Folliard.  We are especially encouraged by the breadth of factors contributing to the earnings improvement, from the strong sales execution to our continued achievement of solid gross profit per unit, and from the improved CAF income to our ability to generate solid SG&A leverage.  While cash for clunkers certainly had a positive effect on traffic and sales, this was only one of many elements that drove our success this quarter.
Earnings and Earnings Per Share
.  As of August 31, 2009, we had net debt of $257.2 million, consisting of $351.1 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $28.4 million of capitalized leases, net of $122.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.  At that date, based on then-current inventory levels, we had additional borrowing capacity of $245.6 million under the revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2011.
Credit Facilities
During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we renewed our warehouse facility, which has a 364-day term.  The size of the warehouse facility was reduced to $1.2 billion from the previous $1.4 billion.  As of August 31, 2009, $575.0 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled $625.0 million.
