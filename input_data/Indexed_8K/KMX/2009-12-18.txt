Richmond, Va., December 18, 2009  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2009.
Third Quarter Business Performance Review
.  We are pleased to report our second consecutive quarter of comparable store used unit sales growth, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  The increase in unit sales resulted from improvements in both customer traffic and sales execution and also reflected the easy comparison with the prior year period.  The increase in customer traffic occurred despite the fact that the governments cash for clunkers program is believed to have pulled some potential sales from the third quarter into July and August.  While customer traffic was stronger than in the prior years quarter, it remained substantially below the level of two years ago.
Sales
The year-over-year improvement in sales execution occurred despite the tightening of lending standards by our third-party finance providers and CAF over the last few quarters.  We estimate that CAFs tightening continued to adversely affect our comparable store used unit sales growth by several percentage points.  In mid-November 2009, we entered into a short-term agreement with Santander Consumer USA where they will purchase a large portion of the loans that CAF would have previously originated prior to the tightening of lending standards.  Due to its timing, this new arrangement had minimal impact on third quarter sales.  However, we believe this new arrangement will substantially offset the effect of the latest tightening of CAF lending standards, implemented in June 2009.

Wholesale unit sales increased 13% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  The increase in unit sales was mainly the result of a significant increase in our appraisal buy rate, as appraisal traffic was similar to the prior years third quarter.  We believe the improvement in our buy rate was largely attributable to the higher year-over-year wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers.
Other sales and revenues increased 3% versus the prior years quarter.  A 20% increase in extended service plan revenues was largely offset by reductions in third-party finance fees and service department sales.  The decline in third-party finance fees primarily reflected a mix shift among providers.
.  Total gross profit increased 22% to $242.9 million from $199.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, reflecting the combination of the increase in unit sales plus an improvement in total gross profit dollars per retail unit, which increased $349 per unit to $3,048 in the current quarter from $2,699 in the corresponding prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit increased to $2,100 per unit from $1,854 per unit in the prior year quarter.  While wholesale industry pricing declined when compared with the second quarter, wholesale valuations remained significantly above the prior years third quarter.  We believe our superior inventory management systems and processes contributed to the strong current quarter profit per unit.  Despite the aggressive reductions in inventory made last year, we were able to achieve inventory turns in this years third quarter that were consistent with the prior year quarter.
Wholesale gross profit increased to $827 per unit in the current quarter, compared with $794 in the third quarter of last year, primarily reflecting both the higher year-over-year wholesale pricing environment and a slight improvement in the already strong car-to-dealer ratio experienced at our auctions.
Other gross profit increased to $439 per unit from $397 per unit in the prior year quarter.  Service department profits grew because our retail vehicle sales growth outpaced fixed service overhead costs, and extended service plan profits benefited from both the increase in used unit sales and the contribution from our new guaranteed asset protection product.
.  CAF reported income of $65.8 million compared with a loss of $15.4 million in last years third quarter.  In both periods, CAF results were affected by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the adjustments increased CAF income by $31.6 million and they included:
CarMax Auto Finance
In the third quarter of last year, the adjustments reduced CAF income by $39.8 million, including $23.8 million of mark-to-market write-downs of retained subordinated bonds and $16.0 million related to increases in cumulative net loss rate assumptions, net of favorable adjustments to prepayment speed assumptions.

Excluding these adjustments from both periods, CAF income increased to $34.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 from $24.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  CAFs gain on loans originated and sold was $17.0 million in the current quarter compared with $11.3 million in the prior year third quarter.  This increase primarily reflected the growth in used vehicle revenues and an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold as a percentage of loans originated and sold (the gain percentage) to 3.6% in the current year quarter versus 2.8% in the third quarter of the prior year.  The current quarters gain percentage primarily benefited from the decline in benchmark interest rates.
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses declined to $192.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 from $217.5 million in the prior years quarter, despite the increase in unit sales.  The decline reflected a reduction in advertising spending in fiscal 2010, decreases in growth-related costs and benefits from a variety of waste-reduction initiatives.  In addition, SG&A expenses in the third quarter of the prior year included approximately $7 million of severance costs and $6 million of costs related to terminating store site acquisitions, partially offset by a $10 million benefit related to freezing the companys pension plans.  The SG&A ratio improved to 11.1% in the current year quarter compared with 14.9% in the prior year quarter, due to both the reduction in absolute SG&A spending and the leverage associated with the increases in used unit sales and average selling prices.
SG&A
.  Income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was reduced by the favorable settlement of prior year tax audits.  As a result, the effective tax rate declined to 35.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with 36.4% in the prior year quarter.  These settlements also reduced our year-to-date effective tax rate from 38.7% as of August 31, 2009, to 37.6% as of November 30, 2009.
Income Taxes
.  We are pleased with the resilience of the CarMax business model, and our ability to report strong earnings growth, despite what remains a challenging sales environment, said Folliard.  However, while sales and traffic appear to be gradually improving, they remain substantially below the levels of two years ago.
Results
.  As of November 30, 2009, we had net debt of $131.7 million, consisting of $118.7 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $28.2 million of capitalized leases, net of $15.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.  At that date, based on then-current inventory levels, we had additional borrowing capacity of $461.3 million under the revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2011.
Credit Facilities
As of November 30, 2009, $416.0 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled $784.0 million.
.  In fiscal 2009, we completed construction of three used car superstores that we chose not to open until market conditions improved.  These stores are located in Augusta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Dayton, Ohio.  While difficult economic conditions persist, we have determined we are now in a position to open these stores during the first half of fiscal 2011, as we believe that these openings will be accretive to earnings.  We may also pursue opportunistic real estate acquisitions to support our long-term store growth.  However, we do not plan to restart store growth at this time.
