Richmond, Va., April 1, 2010  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010.
Fourth Quarter Business Performance Review
.  We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results, especially given the difficult market conditions we faced, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  Our fourth quarter represented our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases in unit sales and earnings.  The 12% increase in comparable store used unit sales reflected roughly equal contributions from improvements in customer traffic and sales execution.
Sales
For the fiscal year, our data indicates that we increased our share of the late-model used vehicle market by more than 10%, while the overall market contracted.  Our ability to grow market share year after year is a testament to the strength of our consumer offer and the preference for our brand.

Our previously announced short-term agreement with Santander Consumer USA, entered into in November, substantially offset the adverse sales effect of CAFs tightening of lending standards implemented earlier in the year.  Under this agreement, Santander is purchasing a large portion of the loans that CAF would have originated previously.  The term of this arrangement has been extended for an additional 90-day period.
Wholesale unit sales increased 24% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.  The increase in unit sales was the result of significant increases in both our appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate.  We believe the improvement in our buy rate was largely attributable to the higher year-over-year wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers.
Other sales and revenues decreased 4% versus the prior years quarter.  A 26% increase in extended service plan revenues was more than offset by a reduction in third-party finance fees.  The decline in third-party finance fees was primarily due to a mix shift among providers.  The percentage of vehicle sales represented by subprime financings, which typically peaks during tax refund season, increased by several percentage points compared with the prior year quarter.
.  Total gross profit increased 15% to $265.2 million from $230.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the 13% increase in used unit sales.  Our total gross profit dollars per retail unit also increased 2%, or $68 per unit, to $2,965 in the current quarter from $2,897 in the corresponding prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Despite the challenging comparison, we were able to increase used vehicle gross profit to $2,067 per unit from $2,040 per unit in the prior years fourth quarter.  The continued strength of our used vehicle gross profit reflected the combination of several factors, including incremental progress on our initiative to reduce waste in the vehicle reconditioning process, the support provided by continued strong wholesale used vehicle valuations and an increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced directly from consumers.
Wholesale gross profit increased to $936 per unit in the current quarter, compared with $882 per unit in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting both the higher year-over-year wholesale pricing environment and continued strong attendance at our auctions, where we achieved a new record dealer-to-car ratio in the quarter.
Other gross profit fell to $436 per unit from $473 per unit in the prior year quarter.  While our extended service plan profits benefited from both the increase in used unit sales and the contribution from our new guaranteed asset protection product, the significant decline in third-party finance fees resulted in the overall decline in other gross profit per unit.
.  CAF income increased to $58.9 million compared with $28.0 million in last years fourth quarter.  CAF income for the current year quarter was increased by $26.6 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods, including:

CAFs gain on loans originated and sold was $15.8 million in both the current quarter and the prior years fourth quarter.  CAFs loans originated and sold rose 20% to $444.9 million, primarily reflecting our retail vehicle revenue growth, as the percentage of sales financed by CAF was similar to last years fourth quarter.  However, the effect of the increase in loan originations was fully offset by a decrease in the gain percentage, which fell to 3.6% in the current year quarter versus 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.  The decline in the gain percentage was primarily due to the combination of more competitive consumer rates and modestly higher funding costs in our warehouse facility compared with last years fourth quarter.
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $202.2 million from $196.7 million in the prior years quarter, compared with the 25% increase in total revenues.  The increase in SG&A primarily reflected the increase in sales commissions and other variable store costs associated with the 13% increase in used unit sales, partially offset by benefits from a variety of waste-reduction initiatives.  The SG&A ratio improved to 11.0% in the current year quarter compared with 13.4% in the prior year quarter, due to both our efforts to control overhead costs and the leverage associated with the increases in used unit sales and average selling prices.
SG&A
For the year, given the weak environment experienced in the last two years, we felt it was prudent to take a particularly cautious approach to SG&A spending.  Accordingly, we made significant curtailments in advertising spending, implemented a wage freeze for all salaried and hourly associates and a hiring freeze at our home office, reduced our management bench strength and deferred developmental and discretionary project spending.  Although we intend to maintain momentum on our initiatives to reduce waste and increase efficiencies, to the extent the economy and our sales improve, we would expect SG&A spending to increase from the current level.
.  We are proud of the efforts of our associates and the resilience of the CarMax business model, which were key factors in our ability to report strong earnings growth, despite what remains a challenging sales environment, said Folliard.  Although part of the improvement reflects the easy comparison with last years fourth quarter, we are particularly proud of the breadth of factors contributing to our higher earnings, including growth in customer traffic; improvements in sales execution; strong gross profit contributions from retail and wholesale operations; a substantial increase in CAF income; and only modest growth in SG&A.
Results
.  As of February 28, 2010, we had net debt of $132.3 million, consisting of $122.5 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $28.1 million of capitalized leases, net of $18.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.  At that date, based on then-current inventory levels, we had additional borrowing capacity of $505.4 million under the revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2011.
Credit Facilities
As of February 28, 2010, $331.0 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled $869.0 million.

Earnings Highlights
Expectations for Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2011
Based upon improvements in our sales and profitability and the increasing stability in the credit markets, we have decided to resume store growth, said Folliard.  We plan to take a measured approach by opening the three previously announced stores in fiscal 2011, between three and five stores in fiscal 2012, and between five and ten stores in fiscal 2013.  This approach
allows us to maintain our momentum on recent initiatives to reduce waste and increase efficiency while still offering superior quality to customers.  It also allows us
to rebuild our store management bench strength and restart our real estate acquisition activity.  
 
The three superstores we plan to open in fiscal 2011 were constructed in fiscal 2009, but we chose not to open them until market conditions improved.  Details of these openings are as follows:
Fiscal 2011 Planned Superstore Openings
We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $90 million in fiscal 2011.  Compared with the $22.4 million of capital spending in fiscal 2010, the increase in planned fiscal 2011 expenditures reflects real estate acquisitions and construction costs associated with the resumption of store growth, as well as information technology and reconditioning equipment upgrades.
By the end of fiscal 2010, we had achieved a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately $200 per vehicle.  This reduction was primarily accomplished through our emphasis on the consistent application of our reconditioning standards across our entire store base.  These savings will be available to continue to optimize future sales and profitability.  To the extent that the economy and our sales improve, we would expect increased store and overhead spending, including payroll, advertising and other costs, in fiscal 2011.
.  As of March 1, 2010, we will adopt Accounting Standards Updates 2009-16 and 2009-17 (formerly Statements of Accounting Standards Nos. 166 and 167, respectively).  Pursuant to these pronouncements, we will recognize existing and future transfers of auto loan receivables in term securitizations as secured borrowings, which will result in the recording of the auto loan receivables and the related notes payable to the investors on our consolidated balance sheets.  Term securitizations will be consolidated based on the unpaid principal balance, less an appropriate reserve for credit losses.  We will also account for future transfers of receivables into our warehouse facility as secured borrowings.

As of March 1, 2010, we amended our warehouse facility agreement.  As a result, the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility prior to that date will be consolidated, along with the related notes payable, at their fair value.
As of March 1, 2010, we expect the cumulative effect of these transactions to result in a $3.7 billion increase in total assets (net of a reserve of approximately $60 million for credit losses) and a $3.8 billion increase in total liabilities.
In future periods, CAF income included in the consolidated statement of earnings will no longer include a gain on the sale of loans originated and sold, but instead will reflect the net interest margin generated by the auto loan receivables less direct CAF expenses.  The net interest margin will include the interest and certain other income associated with the auto loan receivables less a provision for estimated credit losses and the interest expense associated with the non-recourse debt issued to fund these receivables.
Including the effect of these changes, we currently estimate that CAF income will be in the range of $145 million to $185 million in fiscal 2011.  Many factors could affect the actual amount of CAF income recognized, including among others, changes in consumer rates and/or funding costs related to new loan originations, changes in loan loss experience, changes in the volume of CAF loan originations and potential regulatory changes.
