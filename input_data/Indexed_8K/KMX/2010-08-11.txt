To attract and retain key employees, CarMax, Inc. hereby establishes the CarMax, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2011.
The purpose of the Plan is to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified compensation and to have those amounts paid at termination of employment or on a date or dates selected by the Participant.
The Plan is unfunded for federal tax purposes and is intended to be an unfunded arrangement for Eligible Employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated Employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A and shall be implemented, administered and interpreted consistent with ERISA and Section 409A.
Capitalized terms used in this Plan shall have the meanings specified in this Article I.

For purposes of this definition, a change in the ownership of the Company occurs on the date on which any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company.  A change in the effective control of the Company occurs on (i) the date any one person or group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the stock, or (ii) the date a majority of the members of the Companys Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or el ection is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Companys Board before the date of the appointment or election.  A change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company occurs on the date on which any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (other than a person or group of persons that is related to the Company), acquires assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions, taking into account all such assets acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition.
An event constitutes a Change in Control with respect to a Participant only if the Participants relationship to the Company satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(ii).
The determination as to the occurrence of a Change in Control shall be based on objective facts and shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.

A Deferral shall be calculated with respect to the gross cash Compensation payable to the Participant prior to any deductions or withholdings.  However, a Deferral shall be reduced as necessary so that following deduction or withholding from a Participants gross cash Compensation of all required income and employment taxes, other employee benefit deductions, and other deductions required by law, the Deferral does not exceed 100% of the Participants remaining cash Compensation.  Changes to payroll withholdings that affect the amount of Compensation being deferred to the Plan shall be allowed only to the extent permissible under Section 409A.

Except in the case of an Employee on an approved leave of absence as determined under Section 409A, an Employee is deemed to have incurred a Separation from Service on a date if the Employer and the Employee reasonably anticipate that the level of services to be performed by the Employee after that date would be reduced to 35% or less of the average services rendered by the Employee during the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the total period of employment, if less than 36 months), disregarding periods during which the Employee was on an approved leave of absence.

Base salary payable in a calendar year (the subsequent year) solely for services performed during the final regular payroll period of the Company containing December 31 of the prior calendar year is treated as Compensation earned in such subsequent year, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(a)(13).
A Compensation Deferral Agreement described in this Plan Section 3.2(b) becomes irrevocable with respect to such Compensation at 11:59 p.m. EST on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the year in which such Compensation is, or begins to be, earned.
A Compensation Deferral Agreement becomes irrevocable with respect to Performance-Based Compensation at 11:59 p.m. EST on the latest date for filing such election.

Any election to defer Performance-Based Compensation that is made in accordance with this Plan Section 3.2(c) and that becomes payable prior to the satisfaction of the performance criteria as a result of the Participants death or upon a change in control (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) will be void.

(i) a Company matching contribution equal to the additional amounts the Participant would have received as matching contributions under the CarMax, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan and CarMax, Inc. Retirement Restoration Plan for such Plan Year had he not deferred Compensation into this Plan.  The Company matching contribution described in this Plan Section 4.1(i) shall be determined based on the percentage(s) used for the Company matching contributions for the Participant under the CarMax, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan and CarMax, Inc. Retirement Restoration Plan, respectively, over such Plan Year.
(ii) a Company retirement contribution equal to the additional amounts the Participant would have received as discretionary retirement contributions under the CarMax, Inc.

For purposes of Article VI, installment payments will be treated as a single payment.  If a Participant elects to receive a lump sum equal to less than 100% of the Retirement/Termination Account, as described in Plan Section 5.1(c), the payment commencement date for the installment form of payment will be the first anniversary of the payment of the lump sum.
If the Plan receives a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Code section 414(p)(1)(B)) directing that all or a portion of a Participants Account be paid to an "alternate payee," any amounts to be paid to the alternate payee shall be paid in a single lump sum as soon as administratively practicable following the receipt of the executed order.
