Richmond, Va., December 21, 2010  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2010.
Third Quarter Business Performance Review
.  We are pleased to report another quarter of solid increases in sales, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  Comparable store used unit sales increased 16%, representing our strongest comps in several years.  The increase in used unit sales was fueled by both a continued rebound in customer traffic and an improvement in sales conversion.  We believe a portion of the rise in sales conversion reflected improvements in consumer credit availability.
Sales
Wholesale unit sales increased 26% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2010.  The improvement reflected increases in both appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate.  Similar to the last several quarters, we believe the rebound in the appraisal buy rate was driven primarily by the strength of wholesale industry used vehicle pricing, which has allowed us to provide higher appraisal offers.
Other sales and revenues increased 17% compared with the prior years third quarter.  Extended service plan (ESP) revenues increased 31%, reflecting both the growth in used unit sales and an increase in ESP penetration.  ESP penetration benefited from refinements in the plan design implemented earlier this fiscal year.  Service department sales were similar to the prior year quarter, as service resources were used primarily in reconditioning vehicles to support retail unit sales.  Net third-party finance fees declined modestly as an increase in fees received from third-party providers was more than offset by the effect of an increase in the percentage of sales financed by our subprime finance providers.

.  Total gross profit increased 23% to $297.9 million from $242.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting the increases in used and wholesale unit sales and ESP revenues, as well as an improvement in total gross profit dollars per retail unit.  Total gross profit per retail unit increased $127 to $3,175 per unit in the current quarter from $3,048 per unit in the corresponding prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit per unit of $2,103 in the current quarter was relatively unchanged from the $2,100 reported in the prior year quarter.
Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $878 in the current quarter, compared with $827 in the third quarter of last year.  The continued strength of our wholesale profits reflected the favorable wholesale pricing environment, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.
.  Effective March 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting standards under which we now recognize all transfers of auto loan receivables into securitization transactions as secured borrowings.  Beginning in fiscal 2011, CAF income no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions, but instead primarily reflects the interest and certain other income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the non-recourse notes payable issued to fund these receivables, direct CAF expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses.
CarMax Auto Finance
CAF income was $55.7 million compared with $65.8 million in last years third quarter.  In the prior year period, CAF income was increased by adjustments totaling $31.6 million related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods.  These adjustments included $17.6 million of favorable mark-to-market adjustments on retained subordinated bonds and $11.9 million related to more favorable funding costs for auto loans refinanced during the quarter that had been originated in earlier periods.
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14% to $219.7 million from $192.1 million in the prior years third quarter, compared with the 23% increase in total revenues.  The increase in SG&A primarily reflected increases in sales commissions and other variable costs associated with the growth in unit sales, and higher advertising expense.  As sales trends have improved, we have targeted higher levels of advertising expenditures.  The SG&A ratio improved to 10.4% in the current years quarter compared with 11.1% in the priors year quarter, reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in both unit sales and average selling prices.
