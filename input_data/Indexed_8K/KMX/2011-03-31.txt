Richmond, Va., March 31, 2011  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2011.
Fourth Quarter Business Performance Review
.  We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  Comparable store used unit sales increased 12% in the fourth quarter, despite facing the toughest comparison of the year.  The increase in comparable store sales primarily reflected a continued rebound in customer traffic.  Sales execution also remained strong.
Sales
Wholesale unit sales increased 41% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.  The improvement primarily reflected a substantial increase in appraisal traffic.  We believe that our appraisal traffic benefited from the recent improvement in new car industry sales.  Wholesale sales also benefited from our higher appraisal buy rate.  We have achieved a year-over-year improvement in our appraisal buy rate for eight consecutive quarters.

Other sales and revenues increased 19% compared with the prior years fourth quarter, fueled by increases in both extended service plan (ESP) revenues and net third-party finance fees.   ESP revenues included a benefit of $0.01 per share related to a slow down in the rate of ESP cancellations.  While the percent of sales financed by our subprime finance providers was generally consistent with last years fourth quarter, the overall percent of sales financed by third-parties increased.  This change in third-party originations and the resulting increase in net finance fees reflected, in part, the effect of current arrangements with these providers to purchase a portion of the loans that previously would have been originated by CAF.
.  Total gross profit increased 21% to $320.7 million from $265.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting the increases in used and wholesale unit sales, as well as an improvement in total gross profit dollars per retail unit.  Total gross profit per retail unit increased $181 to $3,146 per unit in the current quarter from $2,965 per unit in the corresponding prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit per unit increased to $2,096 in the current quarter from $2,067 in the prior year quarter.  As of the end of fiscal 2011, we estimate our efforts to eliminate waste from our reconditioning processes in recent years have allowed us to achieve a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately $250 per vehicle, on a cumulative basis.
Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $956 in the current quarter, compared with $936 in the fourth quarter of last year.  The continued strength of our wholesale gross profits reflected the strong demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.
.  Effective March 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting standards that affected the timing of the recognition of CAF income.  Beginning in fiscal 2011, CAF income no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions, but instead primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less interest expense, direct CAF expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses.

CAF income was $54.1 million compared with $58.9 million in last years fourth quarter.  In the prior year period, CAF income was increased by adjustments totaling $26.6 million related to loans originated in previous fiscal periods.
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% to $233.5 million from $202.2 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  The increase in SG&A primarily reflected increases in sales commissions and other variable costs associated with the growth in unit sales, and higher advertising expense, as well as costs associated with our resumption of store growth.  The SG&A ratio improved to 10.4% in the current years quarter compared with 11.0% in the priors year quarter, reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in both unit sales and average selling prices.
SG&A
.  The income tax provision for the current years fourth quarter included a benefit of $0.01 per share related to the favorable adjustments relating to prior years tax reserves.

  We are extremely pleased to deliver record profits this year, supported by the solid rebound in sales and traffic and the returns on our continuing efforts to develop associates, drive execution and discover efficiencies, said Folliard.  For the fiscal year, our data indicates that we increased our share of the late-model used vehicle market by approximately 7%.  We believe that our ability to consistently grow market share, regardless of the economic backdrop, is a testament to the strength of our consumer offer, the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand.

Earnings Highlights
Expectations for Fiscal Year Ending February 29, 2012
.  In fiscal 2011, CAF income significantly exceeded our initial expectations due to a combination of factors.  The spread between consumer rates and funding costs remained at wide levels relative to historical averages for the entire year, while we had anticipated a reduction in this spread to more normal levels over the course of the fiscal year.  In addition, better-than-expected loss experience resulted in a provision for loan losses that was significantly lower than we had anticipated.  The provision for loan losses was 0.7% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2011.
CarMax Auto Finance
To help investors understand the effects of last years accounting transition, we are again providing one-time guidance on CAF income at the outset of the fiscal year.  We currently estimate CAF income will be in the range of $205 million to $235 million in fiscal 2012.  We expect a moderate reduction in the spread between consumer rates and our funding costs over the course of the year, although not back to historical averages.  In addition, we expect the provision for loan losses to be approximately 1% of average managed receivables, which would represent an increase compared with fiscal 2011.
A number of factors could affect the actual amount of CAF income in fiscal 2012, including changes in consumer interest rates and/or funding costs related to new loan originations, changes in loan loss experience, changes in the volume of CAF loan originations and potential regulatory changes.  We do not plan to update or provide additional CAF income guidance on a going-forward basis.
Fiscal 2012 Planned Store Openings
Normal construction, permitting or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates of any of these stores into a later period.
We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $225 million in fiscal 2012.  Compared with the $76.6 million of capital spending in fiscal 2011, the increase in planned fiscal 2012 expenditures primarily reflects real estate acquisitions and construction costs associated with store growth.  We incurred no material construction costs in fiscal 2011 related to the three stores opened in the current year.  These stores were built in fiscal 2009, but we chose not to open them until economic conditions improved.  We expect fiscal 2012 capital spending will include some costs for stores planned to be opened in the first half of fiscal 2013.  We currently expect to open between eight and ten stores in fiscal 2013.
