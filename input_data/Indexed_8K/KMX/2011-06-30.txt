(c)           A Participants Maximum Benefit shall be determined as of the commencement of payment of the Supplemental Benefit to the Participant and shall not be subject to future adjustment.  The Supplemental Benefit shall not be reduced if additional benefits become payable from the Pension Plan for any reason.

Notwithstanding anything in the Pension Plan or herein to the contrary, all forms of annuity payments set forth above shall be Actuarially Equivalent in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii).
 
(d)           A Participant may change his or her election made pursuant to Section 4.2(a) and (b) above, provided, however, that if such change is regarded as a change in time and form of payment for purposes of Section 409A and Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii) (relating to life annuities), such change may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made and the payment with respect to which such election is made must be deferred for a period not less than five years from the date the payment would otherwise be made.

The Committee shall determine whether any document received by it is a Domestic Relations Order.  In making this determination, the Committee may consider the rules applicable to domestic relations orders under Code section 414(p) and ERISA section 206(d), and such other rules and procedures as it deems relevant.

(b)           A Participants Supplemental Benefit governed by this Appendix A Section 3 will be paid at the same time and in the same form of payment as benefits for the Participant under the Pension Plan, except as provided in Appendix A Section 4.  If the benefit governed by this Section is to be paid in a form other than the single life annuity form described above, the Supplemental Benefit described in Plan Section 3.2 will be actuarially adjusted, using the actuarial assumptions then in effect under the Pension Plan.

The distribution may be made at any time deemed appropriate by the Company.  The lump sum shall be distributed in cash or a cash equivalent.

(b)           After a distribution under this Section, the Company shall have no further liability with respect to the Pre-2005 Supplemental Benefit.  The Company has the sole discretion to determine when and if a distribution is to be made under this Section, and to determine the amount of any distribution, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to receive a distribution under this Section.
 
5.             A Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit distribution of which begins on or before December 31, 2007, is payable in the same form and at the same time as the survivor benefit is payable under the Pension Plan, including benefit forms that may provide payments after the death of the surviving Spouse.

The CarMax, Inc., Retirement Restoration Plan (Plan) was adopted effective January 1, 2009.  The Plan, as amended and restated on June 30, 2011, is intended to allow the deferral of both salary and annual bonus compensation and to make other changes related to the administration of the Plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to supplement the benefits payable for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of CarMax, Inc. and its affiliates to the extent that retirement contributions are limited under the CarMax, Inc., Retirement Savings Plan as a result of the application of sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The Plan is also intended to provide supplemental savings to eligible employees through a program of elective deferral contributions (that are matched, in part, by employer contributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan).  The Company has determined that the adoption of the Retirement Restoration Plan will assist in attracting and retaining those employees whose abilities and experience will contribute to its continued success.
The Plan is intended to be a plan that is unfunded and maintained by the Company for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as described in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

The Plan will be administered by the Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer of CarMax, Inc. shall appoint at least three persons to serve on the Committee.
      
Except where responsibilities have been allocated or delegated to another person or entity, including the Plan Asset Committee, the Committee will have full power and discretion to administer the Plan, including as to all of its details, including the power to decide Plan benefit claims.  For the purpose of administering the Plan, the Committees power will include, but will not be limited to, the following authority:
(a)           to make and enforce such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or proper for the efficient administration of the Plan or as required to comply with applicable law;
(b)           to interpret the Plan, its interpretation thereof in good faith to be final and conclusive as to any current or former Employee, Participant, or Beneficiary;
 
 
(c)           to decide all questions concerning the Plan, including whether a payment of Plan benefits is due;
(d)           to compute the amount of benefits payable to any current or former Employee, Participant, or Beneficiary in accordance with the Plan, and to determine the person or persons to whom such benefits will be paid;
(e)           to authorize the payment of Plan benefits;
(f)           to keep such records and submit such filings, elections, applications, returns or other documents or forms as may be required under the Code and applicable regulations, or under state or local law and regulations; and
(g)           to appoint such agents, counsel, accountants, consultants and record keepers as may be required to assist in administering the Plan.
 
12
The Company shall indemnify the Committee, the Plan Asset Committee, their respective members, and each other Employee who is involved in the administration of the Plan against all costs, expenses and liabilities, including attorneys fees, incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding that alleges, arises out of, or relates in any way to any good faith act or failure to act in connection with, or related in any way to, the Plan.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any such action, suit or proceeding, the indemnified party shall notify the Company.  The Company shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or to assume the defense of any indemnified party.  If the Company elects to assume the defense, counsel chosen by the Company shall conduct the defense, and the indemnified party shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by him.
The decision or action of the Committee or the Plan Asset Committee in respect of any question within the scope of their respective duties arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations thereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
All reasonable costs incurred in the administration of the Plan shall be paid by the Company.
In discharging the duties assigned to them under the Plan, each of the Company, the Committee, the Plan Asset Committee and each other individual or entity authorized by the Committee or the Plan Asset Committee (each, an Authorized Person) has the discretion to: interpret the Plan; adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations pertaining to its duties under the Plan; and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the discharge of its duties under the Plan.  The discretionary authority of an Authorized Person is absolute and exclusive.  The express grant in the Plan of any specific power to an Authorized Person with respect to any duty assigned to it under the Plan must not be construed as limiting any power or authority of such Authorized Person to discharge its duties.  A decision of an Authorized Person is final and conclusive in any subsequent action, suit, or proceeding unless it is established that the decision constituted an abuse of discretion.  No Plan benefits shall be paid to any Participant, Beneficiary or other person unless an Authorized Person shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such benefits are due.
 
13
 
The Company shall have the right by action of the Committee to amend the Plan from time to time (a) as necessary to ensure the Plan meets requirements under the Code; or (b) to implement changes in Plan design that are not financially material to the Company or the Companys shareholders; provided, however, that no amendment shall retroactively reduce any benefit to a Participant or Beneficiary (to the extent that such benefit was accrued and vested prior to such amendment).  Any amendment to the Plan that is financially material to the Company or the Companys shareholders must be approved by the Board.
The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board provided that any such action shall not, in any way, retroactively reduce any benefit to a Participant or Beneficiary (to the extent that such benefit was accrued and vested prior to such termination).  Any termination of the Plan must satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A.
 
14
 
A Participant, Beneficiary or former Participant (each a Claimant) shall be entitled to file with the Committees delegate a claim for benefits under the Plan.  The claim must be in writing.  Unless another individual or entity is named by the Committee to hear claims for benefits, the Committees delegate shall be the Companys Director of Benefits or the Plans recordkeeper.
 
If the claim is denied by the Committees delegate in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be furnished within 90 days after the receipt by the Committees delegate of the claim (or within 180 days after such receipt if special circumstances require an extension of time) a written notice of denial of the claim containing the following:
(a)           the specific reason or reasons for the denial;
(b)           specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)           a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)           an explanation of the procedure for review of the denied or partially denied claim (set forth below) and applicable time limits, including a statement of the Claimants right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse benefit determination on review.
           
Upon denial of a claim, in whole or in part, the Claimant or his duly authorized representative will have the right to submit a request to the Committee for a full and fair review of the denied claim by filing a written notice of appeal with the Committee.  The notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days of the receipt by the Claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim.  The Claimant or his representative will have, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Claimants claim for benefits and may submit issues and comments in writing.  The Committee will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial decision on the claim.
If the Claimant fails to file an appeal within 60 days of the receipt by the Claimant of the denial of the claim, the claim will be deemed abandoned and the Claimant precluded from reasserting it.  If the Claimant does file an appeal, his request must include a description of the issues and evidence he deems relevant.
 
 
 
15
 
 
The Committee will review and decide whether an appeal is approved or denied.  A written notice of the decision will be furnished to the Claimant within 60 days of the date on which the appeal is received by the Committee.  If special circumstances require a longer period, the Claimant will be notified in writing, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period, of the reasons for an extension of time and the date by which a decision is expected; provided, however, that no extensions will be permitted beyond 60 days after the expiration of the initial 60-day period.  An appeal is considered approved only if its approval is communicated in writing to the Claimant.  If an appeal is denied, in whole or in part, the written notice will clearly set forth:
 
(a)           the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination;
(b)           specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the adverse determination is based;
(c)           a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Claimants claim for benefits; and
(d)           a statement of the Claimants right to bring an action under ERISA section 502(a).
          
A Claimant may not bring any legal action, including commencement of any arbitration, relating to a claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the claims procedures under the Plan and exhausted his administrative remedies under such claims procedures.  Any such legal action must be commenced within one year of a final determination hereunder with respect to such claim.
        
Any action by a current or former Participant or Beneficiary arising out of or related to this Plan shall be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division (District Court) and any reviewing appellate court thereof.  In the event that the District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such an action, then, and only then, such action shall be litigated exclusively in the Circuit Court of Goochland, Virginia and any reviewing appellate court thereof.
 
16
 
The Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Company and any Participant or to be consideration or an inducement for the employment of any Participant of the Company.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with the rights of the Company to discharge or to terminate the service of any Participant at any time without regard to the effect such discharge or termination may have on any rights under the Plan.
All Plan Participants and Beneficiaries are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to the benefits due hereunder and the Plan constitutes a mere promise by the Company to make benefit payments in the future.  It is the intention of the Company that the Plan be considered unfunded for tax purposes.
The Company may, but is not required to, establish a grantor trust, commonly known as a rabbi trust, which may be used to hold assets of the Company which are maintained as reserves against the Companys unfunded, unsecured obligations hereunder.  Such reserves shall at all times be subject to the claims of the Companys creditors.  To the extent such trust or other vehicle is established, and assets contributed, for the purpose of fulfilling the Companys obligation hereunder, then such obligation of the Company shall be reduced to the extent such assets are utilized to meet its obligations hereunder.  Any such trust and the assets held thereunder are intended to conform in substance to the terms of the model trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64.
If a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any benefits hereunder is a minor or is deemed so by the Committee or is adjudged to be legally incapable of giving valid receipt and discharge for such benefits, benefits will be paid to such person as the Committee might designate.  Such payments shall, to the extent made, be deemed a complete discharge of any liability for such payment under the Plan.
 
17
 
Any notice or filing required or permitted to be delivered to the Committee under this Plan shall be delivered in writing.  Notice shall be deemed given as of the date of receipt of the notice by the Committee.  Notice shall be sent by certified mail to:
With a copy to:
Any notice or submission required or permitted to be given to a Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and either hand-delivered or sent by mail to the last known address of the Participant.
To the extent permitted by law, no benefit payable under the Plan will be subject in any manner to anticipation, assignment, garnishment or pledge.  Any attempt to anticipate, assign, garnish or pledge the same will be void and no such benefits will be made in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any Participants.
 
The headings of Plan Sections are included solely for convenience of reference, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of this Plan, the text shall control.
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, all words in any gender shall extend to and include all genders, all words used in the singular shall extend to and include the plural, and all words used in the plural shall extend to and include the singular.
If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof and the Committee may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to construe such invalid or unenforceable provisions in a manner that conforms to applicable law or as if such provisions, to the extent invalid or unenforceable, had not been included.
 
 
 
18
 
Any Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a benefit from the Plan has the duty to keep the Committee advised of his current mailing address.  If benefit payments are returned to the Plan or are not presented for payment after a reasonable amount of time, the Committee shall presume that the payee is missing.  The Committee, after making such efforts as in its sole and absolute discretion it deems reasonable and appropriate to locate the payee, shall stop payment on any uncashed checks and may discontinue making future payments.
At the time of enrollment in the Plan, each Participant must designate a Beneficiary to receive settlement of his Plan account in the event of his death during employment.  A Participant may, from time to time, change a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries under the Plan.  In the event that no designated Beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participants death, settlement under the Plan will be made as provided in Plan Section 1.02.
           
In the event an error or omission is discovered in the operation or administration of the Plan, the Committee may make such equitable adjustments that it deems necessary or desirable to correct the error or omission, so long as the adjustments comply with Section 409A.
      
Except as otherwise provided by federal law, the provisions of this Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to its conflicts of law rules.
   
(a)           Any benefit, payment or other right provided by the Plan shall be provided or made in a manner, and at such time, in such form and subject to such election procedures (if any), as complies with the applicable requirements of Code section 409A to avoid a plan failure described in Code section 409A(a)(1), including without limitation, deferring payment until the occurrence of a specified payment event described in Code section 409A(a)(2).  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or document pertaining hereto, the Plan shall be so construed and interpreted to meet the applicable requirements of Code section 409A to avoid a plan failure described in Code section 409A(a)(1).
 
 
 
19
 
(b)           It is specifically intended that all elections, consents and modifications thereto under the Plan will comply with the requirements of Code section 409A (including any transition or grandfather rules thereunder).  The Company, through the Committee, is authorized to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in connection therewith to anticipate and/or comply with the requirements of Code section 409A (including any transition or grandfather rules thereunder) and to declare any election, consent or modification thereto void if non-compliant with Code section 409A.

To attract and retain key employees, CarMax, Inc. hereby establishes the CarMax, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2011.  This Plan was amended and restated on June 30, 2011, to make certain changes related to the administration of the Plan.
The purpose of the Plan is to provide Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified compensation and to have those amounts paid at termination of employment or on a date or dates selected by the Participant.
The Plan is unfunded for federal tax purposes and is intended to be an unfunded arrangement for Eligible Employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated Employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.
The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A and shall be implemented, administered and interpreted consistent with ERISA and Section 409A.
Capitalized terms used in this Plan shall have the meanings specified in this Article I.

For purposes of this definition, a change in the ownership of the Company occurs on the date on which any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company.  A change in the effective control of the Company occurs on (i) the date any one person or group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the stock, or (ii) the date a majority of the members of the Companys Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Companys Board before the date of the appointment or election.  A change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company occurs on the date on which any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (other than a person or group of persons that is related to the Company), acquires assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions, taking into account all such assets acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition.
An event constitutes a Change in Control with respect to a Participant only if the Participants relationship to the Company satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(ii).
The determination as to the occurrence of a Change in Control shall be based on objective facts and shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.

A Deferral shall be calculated with respect to the gross cash Compensation payable to the Participant prior to any deductions or withholdings.  However, a Deferral shall be reduced as necessary so that following deduction or withholding from a Participants gross cash Compensation of all required income and employment taxes, other employee benefit deductions, and other deductions required by law, the Deferral does not exceed 100% of the Participants remaining cash Compensation.  Changes to payroll withholdings that affect the amount of Compensation being deferred to the Plan shall be allowed only to the extent permissible under Section 409A.

A Compensation Deferral Agreement becomes irrevocable with respect to Performance-Based Compensation at 11:59 p.m. EST on the latest date for filing such election.
Any election to defer Performance-Based Compensation that is made in accordance with this Plan Section 3.2(c) and that becomes payable prior to the satisfaction of the performance criteria as a result of the Participants death or upon a change in control (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) will be void.
