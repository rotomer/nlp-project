Second Quarter Business Performance Review
"We are pleased with our ability to increase earnings despite the 2% decline in comparable store used unit sales," said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. "Our diversified business model enabled us to deliver the second highest quarterly earnings in our history, as the strength of our wholesale and finance operations offset the effect of softer used unit comps. We remain focused on continuing to expand our store base and drive execution and efficiencies."
. We believe the 2% decline in used unit comps primarily reflected the recent economic slowdown and further reductions in consumer confidence levels. Traffic and conversion trends softened compared with recent quarters. Average selling prices continued to climb, as the tight supply of late-model used vehicles increased our acquisition costs compared with the prior year.
Sales
Wholesale unit sales increased 23% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Similar to the last several quarters, our wholesale volumes benefited from a strong increase in appraisal traffic and a continued strong buy rate.
Other sales and revenues fell 5% compared with the prior year's second quarter. This decline was largely driven by the decrease in third-party finance fees, which resulted from the decision by CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) earlier this year to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing. This decision should result in increased CAF income over time.

. Total gross profit increased to $354.3 million from $349.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting the strong results of our wholesale auctions.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit was $224.0 million, similar to the $228.1 million in the prior year period. The decline resulted from the combination of a slight moderation in gross profit per unit, to $2,178 from $2,205 in the prior year quarter, and the 1% decline in total used unit volumes.
Wholesale gross profit increased 33% to $78.8 million compared with $59.3 million in the second quarter of the prior year, driven by the 23% increase in wholesale unit sales and an improvement in gross profit per unit to $929 from $858 in the prior year quarter. The strength of our wholesale profit per unit reflected the continued strong demand and pricing at our auctions.
. CAF income increased 21% to $63.8 million compared with $52.6 million in last year's second quarter primarily driven by higher interest margin, which rose to $85.6 million from $72.2 million. The increase in interest margin reflected increases in both average managed receivables and the spread between the interest charged to consumers and our related funding costs.
CarMax Auto Finance
CAF net loans originated increased 27% compared with the prior year quarter. The increase reflected our previously reported decision to retain an increasing portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing, as well as higher average selling prices.
. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% to $236.4 million from $225.2 million in the prior year's second quarter. We have continued to fund initiatives that we believe will support the long-term growth of our company, including increased advertising and targeted spending to support future store growth. The SG&A ratio improved to 9.1% from 9.6% in the prior's year quarter, primarily due to the effect of higher average selling prices.
SG&A
. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we expanded our presence in the San Diego market, opening a store in Escondido, California.
Superstore Openings
. During the quarter, we entered into a new 5-year, $700 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the existing secured facility that was scheduled to expire in December. We also renewed our $800 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in August. Included in this renewal was a temporary increase in our total warehouse capacity to $2.0 billion. The total warehouse capacity will return to $1.6 billion concurrent with the closing of the sale of $650 million of receivables in the 2011-2 term securitization.
