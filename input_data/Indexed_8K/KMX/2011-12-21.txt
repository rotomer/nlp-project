Third Quarter Business Performance Review
"We are pleased to report another quarter of strong profits, despite a difficult sales comparison and the continued sluggish economy," said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. "We remain committed to investing in our long-term growth strategy. We now plan to open 10 stores in fiscal 2013 and are pleased to announce our plan to open between 10 and 15 stores per year during each of the following three fiscal years."
. We believe the 3% decline in comparable store used units resulted from several factors, including our toughest sales comparison in many quarters and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much of the third quarter. Our average used vehicle selling price remained higher than the prior year, reflecting the continuing effect of the tight supply of late-model used vehicles on our acquisition costs. However, average retails have begun to moderate from earlier this year due to shifts in mix, as well as recent declines in industry wholesale pricing.

Wholesale unit sales increased 13% compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Similar to the last several quarters, our wholesale volumes benefited from a strong increase in appraisal traffic.
Other sales and revenues declined 8% compared with the prior year's third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in third-party finance fees. This decrease resulted from the decision made earlier this year by CAF to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been temporarily purchasing. In addition, it reflects an increase in the percentage of sales financed by our subprime finance providers, who purchase subprime financings from us at a discount.
. Total gross profit increased to $303.2 million from $297.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, reflecting higher gross profit on our retail and wholesale vehicle sales, partly offset by reduced other gross profit.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit increased 2% to $197.5 million from $193.2 million in the prior year period. The improvement resulted from a 3% increase in gross profit per unit, to $2,171 from $2,103 in the prior year quarter, partly offset by the 1% decline in total used unit volumes. We have been able to manage to a relatively consistent gross profit per unit over the last three years.
Wholesale gross profit increased 18% to $66.5 million compared with $56.5 million in the third quarter of the prior year, driven by the 13% increase in wholesale unit sales and an improvement in gross profit per unit to $914 from $878 in the prior year quarter. The strength of our wholesale profit per unit was fueled by the continued strong demand and pricing at our auctions.
Other gross profit declined 20% to $37.2 million from $46.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease included the effects of the reduction in third-party finance fees and a decrease in service department profits.
. CAF income increased 12% to $62.6 million compared with $55.7 million in last year's third quarter primarily due to the interest margin, which rose to $88.7 million from $73.8 million. The increase in interest margin was driven by increases in both average managed receivables and the spread between the interest charged to consumers and our related funding costs.
CarMax Auto Finance
CAF net loans originated increased 34% compared with the prior year quarter. The increase reflected our previously reported decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been temporarily purchasing. The provision for loan losses increased to $15.1 million from $8.6 million in last year's third quarter, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk.
. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% to $232.3 million from $219.7 million in the prior year's third quarter as we continued to ramp store growth and fund initiatives to support the long-term growth of the company. The SG&A ratio was 10.3% compared with 10.4% in the prior year quarter. The change was primarily due to the effect of higher average selling prices.
SG&A
. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered the Providence, Rhode Island market, opening a store in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.
