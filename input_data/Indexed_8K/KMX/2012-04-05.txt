Exhibit 99.1
 
Richmond, Va., April 5, 2012  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results," said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. "We hit some major milestones this year, including total revenues of $10 billion and annual used retail vehicle sales in excess of 400,000 units, and we look forward to continued growth as we expand our store base in the coming years."
Fourth Quarter Business Performance Review
. Comparable store used unit sales grew 4% compared with a 12% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Used unit sales benefited from strong subprime-financed sales, as well as an extra day in the current year quarter due to leap year.
Sales
For the fiscal year, our data indicates that we increased our share of the late-model (0-to 6-year old) used vehicle market by approximately 3%. We remain confident that the strength of our consumer offer and the skill of our associates, combined with our resumption of store growth, will continue to drive future share gains.

Wholesale unit sales increased 13% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Similar to the last several quarters, our wholesale volumes benefited from a strong increase in appraisal traffic and a solid buy percentage. We believe appraisal traffic is benefiting from the increase in industry new car sales.
Other sales and revenues declined 12% compared with the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in third-party finance fees, which resulted from a mix change among third-party finance providers. Subprime providers, who generally purchase subprime financings at a discount, originated 15% of used vehicle sales in the current year's quarter compared with 9% in the prior year's fourth quarter. At the same time, as CAF has continued to retain an increased portion of the loans that had been purchased by third-party providers, the fees received from these third parties have declined.
. Total gross profit increased 5% to $338.2 million from $320.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, reflecting a higher gross profit contribution from retail and wholesale vehicles, partly offset by a reduction in other gross profit.
Gross Profit
Used vehicle gross profit increased 8% to $225.8 million from $209.5 million in the prior year period. The improvement resulted from the combination of the 6% increase in used units and a 2% increase in gross profit per unit, to $2,135 from $2,096 in the prior year quarter. Last year, we reported that our efforts to eliminate waste from our used vehicle reconditioning processes in recent years had allowed us to achieve a cumulative, sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately $250 per vehicle. Adjusting for an increase in the average age of vehicles reconditioned and sold, we continued to realize $250 per unit in savings in fiscal 2012.
Wholesale gross profit increased 13% to $70.2 million compared with $62.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which was driven by the 13% increase in wholesale unit sales. Wholesale gross profit per unit of $950 was similar to the $956 in the prior year quarter. The strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit continued to be fueled by the strong demand and pricing at our auctions.
Other gross profit declined 14% to $40.8 million from $47.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease was similar to the decline in other sales and revenues and was primarily due to the change in third-party finance fees.
. CAF income increased 22% to $66.1 million compared with $54.1 million in last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in interest margin, which rose to $88.9 million from $74.6 million. The growth in interest margin was driven by increases in both average managed receivables and the spread between the interest charged to consumers and our related funding costs.
CarMax Auto Finance
CAF net loans originated increased 36% compared with the prior year quarter. The increase reflected our previously reported decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing. As of January 2012, CAF had transitioned back to retaining all of these loans. The provision for loan losses was 0.9% of average receivables in both the current year and prior year quarter, as favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012 largely offset the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk.
. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% to $243.5 million from $226.9 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses reflected the expansion of our store base, increases in sales commissions and other variable costs, and higher growth-related costs, partly offset by lower advertising expense. Growth-related costs include store pre-opening expenses, relocation expenses and costs of maintaining management bench strength to support future growth. SG&A per used unit increased slightly, to $2,302 versus $2,270 in the prior year's quarter. The SG&A ratio improved to 9.8% compared with 10.1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in used and wholesale vehicle sales, and average selling prices.

Store Opening Plan
We currently plan to open the following ten superstores during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2013:
 
 
Normal construction, permitting or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates of any of these stores into a later period. We expect to open between 10 and 15 superstores during each of the three fiscal years following fiscal 2013.
We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $280 million in fiscal 2013.
Lease Accounting Revisions
We have revised our previously issued consolidated financial statements to correct our accounting for sale-leasebacks entered into between 1995 and 2009. As a result of the revision, we have recorded certain properties subject to the sale-leasebacks as assets and the related sale proceeds as financing liabilities. Depreciation is being recognized on the assets. Payments on the leases are now recognized as interest expense and a reduction in the financing liabilities, rather than being recognized as rent expense. We have determined that our financial statements were not materially affected by the revision. As a result of the correction, reported net earnings per diluted share were reduced by $0.02 in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.
More detailed information will be provided in the annual consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012. In addition, for the convenience of investors, a summary of our revised consolidated statements of earnings for each of the interim quarters in the fiscal years ended February 29, 2012, and February 28, 2011, is included in this release.
