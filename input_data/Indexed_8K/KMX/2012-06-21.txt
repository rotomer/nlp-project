First Quarter Business Performance Review
"Although comparable store used unit sales were flat, solid execution resulted in strong used and wholesale gross profit per unit and higher CAF income," said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer. Total customer traffic and conversion at comparable stores were both similar to the prior year's quarter.
Wholesale unit sales declined 2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, following increases of 32% and 52% in the first quarter of the two previous fiscal years. The decline reflected the challenging year-over-year comparison, as well as a shift in the calendar that resulted in one less Tuesday auction date. Absent the calendar shift, we estimate wholesale unit sales would have been similar to last year's first quarter. Appraisal traffic remained higher than in the prior year; however, our appraisal buy rate was slightly below the prior year level.

Other sales and revenues declined 9% compared with the prior year's quarter primarily due to a mix shift among finance providers. Third-party subprime providers, who purchase subprime financings at a discount, originated 16% of used vehicle sales in the current quarter compared with 8% in the prior year quarter. In addition, CAF increased its share of financings, reducing fees received from other third-parties. The change in third-party finance fees was partially offset by an 11% increase in extended service plan (ESP) revenues, which resulted from an increase in ESP penetration and the growth in our retail vehicle sales.
.Total gross profit was $381.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared with $383.1 million in the prior year quarter, as an increase in used vehicle gross profit was offset by reductions in wholesale and other gross profit. Used vehicle gross profit increased 3%, to $249.4 million, primarily driven by the growth in used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit was virtually unchanged, at $2,221 per unit compared with $2,224 per unit in the prior year quarter.
Gross Profit
Wholesale vehicle gross profit declined 5%, to $81.9 million, as a result of the 2% decrease in wholesale unit sales and a reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit to $980 from $1,013 in the prior year quarter. While below the prior year's record amount, the $980 per unit still represented the second highest level of wholesale gross profit per unit in the company's history.
Other gross profit declined 9% to $49.1 million from $54.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in third-party finance fees.
. CAF income grew 8% to $75.2 million compared with $69.7 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Favorable CAF loss experience increased net earnings by $0.01 per share in this year's first quarter and $0.03 per share in last year's quarter. Excluding the loss favorability in both periods, the percentage growth in CAF income would have more closely resembled the increase in average managed receivables.
CarMax Auto Finance
CAF's average managed receivables grew 16% to $5.08 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared with $4.39 billion in the prior year period. The growth reflected increased origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Origination volumes benefited from an increase in CAF's loan penetration, as we transitioned back to a pre-recession origination strategy and reduced the volume of loans sold to third-party providers. Originations also benefited from increased average selling prices and retail unit sales during fiscal 2012 and 2013. The allowance for loan losses increased modestly to 0.9% of managed receivables as of May 31, 2012, compared with 0.8% as of May 31, 2011, as the effect of the change in the credit mix was largely offset by favorable loss performance.
. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% to $253.6 million from $241.7 million in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses reflected the addition of five stores to our base since the end of last year's first quarter and higher growth-related costs, which include pre-opening and relocation expenses and the cost of building management bench strength. SG&A per retail unit increased to $2,217 versus $2,178 in the prior year's quarter, reflecting the investment associated with this year's higher store growth rate and the lack of overhead leverage resulting from flat comparable store used unit sales.
SG&A
. We plan to open ten superstores in fiscal 2013, double the number opened in fiscal 2012. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we opened two used car superstores, entering the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Bakersfield, California, markets. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we opened stores in Nashville, Tennessee, and Ft. Myers, Florida.
