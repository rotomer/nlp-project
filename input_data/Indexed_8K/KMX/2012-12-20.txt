CARMAX REPORTS
RECORD THIRD
QUARTER RESULTS
 
 
Richmond, Va., December 20, 2012  CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today reported
record
results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2012.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter Business Performance Review
 
We are pleased to
report strong increases in
used
and wholesale vehicle
unit
sales
and CAF income,
which
drove
solid bottom-line earnings growth, said Tom Folliard, president and chief executive officer.  
Our
 
strong comparable store
sales
growth
allowed us to leverage SG&A expenses, even as we
expanded
our store base. 
 
Sales
.  Used vehicle sales improved significantly, with total used units climbing 16% and comparable store used units up 12%.  The comparable store used unit growth was driven by improved conversion, which we believe benefited from a variety of factors, including more compelling credit offers from third-party finance providers and CAF, increased inventory selection, improved c
ustomer sentiment
 
and
continued strong in-store execution.
 
The used vehicle average selling price was similar to the prior years quarter. 
 
Wholesale vehicle unit sales
grew
10% compared with last years quarter.  Wholesale unit sales benefited from an increase in appraisal traffic, while the appraisal buy rate was similar to the prior years quarter. 
-more-
 
 
 
 
Other sales and revenues increased 5% compared with the prior years third quarter, as an increase in extended service plan (ESP) revenues was largely offset by a reduction in net third-party finance fees.  Third-party subprime providers, who purchase subprime financings at a discount, originated 14% of used vehicle unit sales in the current quarter compared with 9% in the prior year quarter.  ESP revenues climbed 22% due to both the growth in used vehicle sales and an increase in ESP penetration.
 
Gross Profit
.  Total gross profit increased 1
4
% to $34
5.2
million from $303.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, primarily reflecting the increased
used
and wholesale vehicle
unit
sales, as well as higher other gross profit. 
 
Used vehicle gross profit
rose
15% to $22
7.0
million driven by the 16% increase in used unit sales.  Used
vehicle
gross profit per unit
was relatively consistent at
$2,14
6
versus $2,171 in last years third quarter
. 
 
Wholesale gross profit increased 11% to
$
73.6 million, driven by the 10% increase in wholesale unit sales.  Wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit remained stable at $92
3
compared with $914 in the prior year quarter. 
 
Other gross profit rose
18
% to
$
4
3.7
million, as improved ESP and service department profits were partially offset by the lower net third
-
party finance fees. 
 
CarMax Auto Finance
. 
CAF income increased 16% to
$
72.
5
million compared with $62.6 million in last years third quarter.  The
growth
in CAF income was
largely attributable to
the 15% increase in average managed receivables, which grew to $5.48 billion from $4.77 billion
in the prior
year
period
.  The increase in average managed receivables reflected the
rise
in CAF origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013
as we transitioned back to our pre-recession origination strategy, higher average amounts financed and the growth in retail unit sales
. 
 
 
The allowance for loan losses
was
1.0% of managed receivables as of November
 
30,
 
2012, compared with 0.9% as of November 30, 2011. 
Continued favorable loss experience partially offset the effect of the change in credit mix resulting from the transition in origination strategy.
 
SG&A
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1
4
% to $25
7.3
 million from $225.8 million in the prior years third quarter.  The increase primarily reflected the combination of the 9% increase in our store base since the beginning of last years third quarter (representing the addition of 10 stores) and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 12% increase in comparable store used unit sales.  SG&A per retail unit declined to $2,3
9
3 versus $2,
436 in the prior years quarter as the leverage resulting from the comparable store unit sales growth was partially offset by higher costs related to growing our store base.
 
Superstore Openings
. 
As of November 30, 2012, we had opened eight of the ten used car superstores that we plan to open in
fiscal 2013
. 
During the third quarter, we opened three stores, entering the Des Moines and Denver
 
markets, and adding our tenth store in
the
Los Angeles
market
. 
 
Share
Repurchase
Program
.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $60.2 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.  The repurchase activity had no effect on reported third quarter net earnings per share.
