EXHIBIT INDEX 5

EXHIBIT 1.1 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT Atlanta, Georgia To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), certain of its debt securities ("Purchased Debt Securities") and/or warrants to purchase certain of its debt securities ("Debt Warrants"), as identified and in an aggregate principal amount indicated in Schedule I hereto. The Purchased Debt Securities, the Debt Warrants and the debt securities subject to such Debt Warrants ("Warrant Debt Securities") are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Securities." The Purchased Debt Securities and the Warrant Debt Securities are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Debt Securities." The Purchased Debt Securities and the Debt Warrants are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Purchased Securities." The Debt Securities will be issued under an amended and restated indenture dated as of April 26, 1988, between the Company and Bankers Trust Company, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended by a first supplemental indenture dated as of February 24, 1992 (as such indenture may be further amended from time to time, the "Indenture"). The Debt Warrants will be issued under a debt warrant agreement (the "Debt Warrant Agreement") to be entered into between the Company and a bank or trust company, as debt warrant agent, specified in Schedule I hereto if Debt Warrants are being issued. If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter as set forth below in this Section 1. Certain terms used in this Section 1 are defined in paragraph (c) hereof. (a) If the offering of the Securities is a Delayed Offering (as specified in Schedule I hereto), paragraph (i) below is applicable and, if the offering of the Securities is a Non-Delayed Offering (as so specified), paragraph (ii) below is applicable. (i) The Company meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") one or more registration statements (the file number(s) of which is set forth in
Schedule I hereto, one or both such registration statements being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement") on such Form, including a basic prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. The Company may have filed one or more amendments thereto, and may have used a Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has previously been furnished to you. Such Registration Statement, as so amended, has become effective. The offering of the Securities is a Delayed Offering and, accordingly, it is not necessary that any further information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus have been included in an amendment to such Registration Statement prior to the Effective Date. The Company will next file with the Commission pursuant to Rules 415 and 424(b)(2) or (5) a final supplement to the form of prospectus included in such Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall include all required information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. (ii) The Company meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Act and has filed with the Commission the Registration Statement (the file number(s) of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on such Form, including a basic prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. The Company may have filed one or more amendments thereto, including a Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will next file with the Commission either (x) a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rules 430A and 424(b)(1) or (4), or (y) prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement, an amendment to such Registration Statement, including the form of final prospectus supplement. In the case of clause (x), the Company has included in such Registration Statement, as amended at the Effective Date, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement or such amendment and form of final prospectus supplement shall contain all Rule 430A Information, together with all other such required information, with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form -2-
furnished to you prior to the Execution Time, or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. (b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did or will, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed (if required) in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the respective rules thereunder; on the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date, the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules thereunder; and, on the Effective Date, the Final Prospectus, if not filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), did not or will not, and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations, warranties or agreements as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto). (c) The terms which follow, when used in this Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The term "the Effective Date" shall mean each date that the Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment or amendments thereto and any 462(b) Registration Statement became or becomes effective. "Execution Time" shall mean the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus referred to in paragraph (a) above contained in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date including any Preliminary Final Prospectus. "Preliminary Final Prospectus" shall mean any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Basic Prospectus which describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Final Prospectus. "Final Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus supplement relating to the Securities that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the -3-
Execution Time, together with the Basic Prospectus or, if, in the case of a Non-Delayed Offering, no filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) is required, shall mean the form of final prospectus relating to the Securities, including the Basic Prospectus, included in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date. "Registration Statement" shall mean the registration statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, including exhibits and financial statements, as amended at the Execution Time and, in the event any post-effective amendment thereto or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement becomes effective prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), shall also mean such registration statement as so amended or such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, as the case may be. Such term shall include any Rule 430A Information deemed to be included therein at the Effective Date as provided by Rule 430A. "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement" shall mean a registration statement and any amendments thereto filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) relating to the offering covered by the registration statement referred to in paragraph (a) above. "Rule 415", "Rule 424", "Rule 430A", "Rule 462(b)" and "Regulation S-K" refers to such rules or regulation under the Act. "Rule 430A Information" means information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof permitted to be omitted from the Registration Statement when it becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. A "Non-Delayed Offering" shall mean an offering of securities which is intended to commence promptly after the effective date of a registration statement, with the result that, pursuant to Rules 415 and 430A, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) with respect to the securities so offered must be included in such registration statement at the effective date thereof. A "Delayed Offering" shall mean an offering of securities pursuant to Rule 415 which does not commence promptly after the effective date of a registration statement, with the result that only information required pursuant to Rule 415 need be included in such registration statement at the effective date thereof with respect to the securities so offered. Whether the offering of the Securities is a Non-Delayed Offering or a Delayed Offering shall be set forth in Schedule I hereto. 2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase -4-
from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Purchased Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto, except that, if Schedule I hereto provides for the sale of Purchased Securities pursuant to delayed delivery arrangements, the respective principal amounts of Purchased Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be as set forth in Schedule II hereto less the respective amounts of Contract Securities determined as provided below. Purchased Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters are herein sometimes called the "Underwriters' Securities" and Purchased Securities to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts as hereinafter provided are herein called "Contract Securities." If so provided in Schedule I hereto, the Underwriters are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Purchased Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Schedule III hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. The Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements and, as compensation therefor, the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the account of the Underwriters, on the Closing Date, as a fee, the percentage set forth in Schedule I hereto of the principal amount of the Purchased Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. The Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts in all cases where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company but, except as the Company may otherwise agree, each such Delayed Delivery Contract must be for not less than the minimum principal amount set forth in Schedule I hereto and the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities may not exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule I hereto. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. The principal amount of Purchased Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto shall be reduced by an amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Contract Securities as the principal amount of Purchased Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto, except to the extent that you determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than in such proportion and so advise the Company in writing; provided, however, that the total principal amount of Purchased Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto less the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities. 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made at the office, on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto (or such later date not later than three business days after such specified date as the Representatives shall designate), which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Underwriters' Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Underwriters' Securities shall be made to the -5-
Representatives for the respective accounts of the several underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to the Company by wire transfer payable in immediately available federal funds. Delivery of the Underwriters' Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. 4. Agreements. (a) The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that: (i) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished the Representatives a copy for their review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment, supplement or Rule 462(b) Registration Statement to which they reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (ii) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section -6-
4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. (iii) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earning statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act. (iv) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (v) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors. (vi) Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act. (b) If the Securities will be offered and sold in jurisdictions outside the United States, each Underwriter further agrees and hereby represents that: (i) it has not offered or sold, and, prior to the expiration of the period of six months from the Closing Date, will not offer or sell any Securities to persons in the United Kingdom, except to those persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments, as principal or agent, for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995, as amended; (ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services Act 1986, with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; (iii) it has only issued or passed on and will only issue or pass on in the United Kingdom any document received by it in connection with the issue of the Securities to a person who is of a kind described in Article 11(3) of the Financial -7-
Services Act 1986 (Investment Advertisements) (Exemptions) Order 1996, as amended, or is a person to whom the document may otherwise lawfully be issued or passed on; (iv) it will not offer or sell any Securities directly or indirectly in Japan or to, or for the benefit of any Japanese person or to others, for re-offering or re-sale directly or indirectly in Japan or to any Japanese person except under circumstances which will result in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by the relevant governmental and regulatory authorities in effect at the relevant time. For purposes of this paragraph, "Japanese person" means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan; (v) it is aware of the fact that no German selling prospectus (Verkaufsprospekt) has been or will be published in respect of the sale of the Securities and that it will comply with the Securities Selling Prospectus Act (the "SSPA") of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapier-Verkaufsprospektgesetz). In particular, each underwriter has undertaken not to engage in public offering (offentliche Anbieten) in the Federal Republic of Germany with respect to any Securities otherwise than in accordance with the SSPA and any other act replacing or supplementing the SSPA and all the other applicable laws and regulations; (vi) the Securities are being issued and sold outside the Republic of France and that, in connection with their initial distribution, it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell, directly or indirectly, any Securities to the public in the Republic of France, and that it has not distributed and will not distribute or cause to be distributed to the public in the Republic of France the Final Prospectus, the Basic Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Securities; and (vii) it and each of its affiliates has not offered or sold, and it will not offer or sell, the Securities by means of any document to persons in Hong Kong other than persons whose ordinary business it is to buy or sell shares or debentures, whether as principal or agent, or otherwise in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong). 5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwriters' Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: -8-
(a) The Registration Statement, other than any 462(b) Registration Statement, has become effective prior to the Execution Time; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 PM, Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the Execution Time; if filing of the Final Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Final Prospectus, and any such supplement, shall have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened. (b) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives the opinion of King & Spalding, counsel for the Company, or such other counsel as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Representatives, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that: (i) The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and, to such counsel's knowledge, is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification and wherein a failure to so qualify or be in good standing would have a material adverse effect upon the operations or financial position of the Company; (ii) The Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Final Prospectus; and the Securities being issued and sold conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Final Prospectus; (iii) This Agreement, the Indenture and any Debt Warrant Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and the Indenture and any Debt Warrant Agreement each constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity); and the Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, in the case of the Debt Securities, and the Debt Warrant Agreement, in the case of the Debt Warrants, and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, in the case of the Underwriters' Securities, or by the purchasers thereof pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, in the case of any Contract Securities, will constitute -9-
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, in the case of the Debt Securities, and the Debt Warrant Agreement, in the case of the Debt Warrants (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity); (iv) (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); (b) to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; and (c) such counsel has no reason to believe that at the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (v) No consent, approval or authorization of any governmental agency or body is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Purchased Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated by the Final Prospectus; (vi) Neither the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or of any Delayed Delivery Contracts will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or, to such counsel's knowledge, the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or to any document filed under the Exchange Act and incorporated into the Registration Statement, or any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any -10-
of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (vii) To such counsel's knowledge, no holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that in clause (iii) with respect to the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, any Debt Warrant Agreement and the Securities, and in clause (v) and in clause (vi) with respect to any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency, body or court and the power and authority of the Company to authorize, issue and sell the Securities, such counsel has assumed that under the laws of any country in whose currency any Securities are denominated, if other than in U.S. dollars, that no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency, body or court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in any breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions in any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court. Such counsel may note that (a) a New York statute provides that with respect to a foreign currency obligation a court of the State of New York shall render a judgment or decree in such foreign currency and such judgment or decree shall be converted into currency of the United States at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment and (b) with respect to a foreign currency obligation a United States court in New York may award judgment in United States dollars, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply. Further, in rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Georgia, the State of New York or the United States, or the Delaware General Corporation Law, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date. (c) The Representatives shall have received from Alston & Bird LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, any Debt Warrant Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. -11-
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplement to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that: (i) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (e) At the Closing Date, Ernst & Young shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that: (i) In their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations; (ii) On the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain procedures specified by the American -12-
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71 (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the share owners and the board of directors of the Company; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) the amounts included in the unaudited "Income Statement Information", if any, included in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; and the amounts in the "Selected Financial Data" included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding amounts in the unaudited or audited financial statements from which such amounts were derived; (2) any unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or (3) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries (exclusive of changes due to foreign currency exchange rates) or capital stock of the Company (other than -13-
issuances of capital stock upon exercise of stock options, stock swaps and stock appreciation rights which were outstanding on the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus) or decreases in the share-owners' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in net operating revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases that the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur or as set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and (iii) On the basis of performing certain other procedures, as determined and specified by the Underwriters, relating to certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of and subject to the internal controls of the accounting systems of the Company and its subsidiaries) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus that such information agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). -14-
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation. (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. (i) The Company shall have accepted Delayed Delivery Contracts in any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company. (j) The Representatives shall have received from counsel, satisfactory to the Representatives, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to compliance with the laws of any country, other than the United States, in whose currency Debt Securities or Debt Warrants are denominated, the validity of the Securities, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (k) If indicated in Schedule I hereto as being applicable to the offering of any Securities, the Representatives shall have received an opinion from tax counsel for the Company, satisfactory to the Representatives and dated the Closing Date, confirming their opinion as to United States tax matters set forth in the Final Prospectus. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and its counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. 6. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. -15-
7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to -16-
stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and, if Schedule I hereto provides for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery arrangements, in the last sentence under the heading "Delayed Delivery Arrangements" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would represent such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified -17-
parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigation or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to preceding sentence of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph -18-
(d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d). 8. Default by an Underwriter. It any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Purchased Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Purchased Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Purchased Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Purchased Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Purchased Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Section 8 only, the "aggregate amount" of Purchased Securities shall mean the aggregate principal amount of any Purchased Debt Securities plus the public offering price of any Debt Warrants included in the relevant offering of Purchased Securities. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Purchased Securities, if prior to such time (i) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) there shall have been a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York state authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) there shall have been an outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or (v) there shall have occurred any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with -19-
the public offering or the delivery of the Purchased Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the prospectus. 10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Purchased Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or sent by facsimile and confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or sent by facsimile and confirmed to it at One Coca-Cola Plaza, Atlanta, Georgia 30313, to the attention of the Treasurer, with a copy to the attention of the General Counsel of the Company at the same address. 12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 13. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. [Signatures on Following Page] -20-

The interest so payable, and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the May 15 or November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest which is payable but is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this Series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

[Reverse] This Note (as defined herein) is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of April 26, 1988, as amended and supplemented by that First Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 24, 1992 (as so amended and supplemented, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be denominated and bear interest, if any, in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Security is one of a Series of Securities of the Company designated as set forth on the face hereof (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $750,000,000. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, redemption or transfer of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of The Depository Trust Company applicable to, and as in effect at the time of, such transaction. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of such principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes shall terminate. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount R-1
of the Securities of each Series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such Series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture. Section 12.01(a) of the Indenture also contains provisions applicable to the Notes relating to the Company's ability to discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, upon the deposit of money, U.S. Government Obligations or other government obligations, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Notes to the Maturity of the Note, in certain specified circumstances. The lien and sale and lease back provisions described in Sections 5.03 and 5.04 of the Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes. Subject to the next preceding sentence hereof, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed, by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Company shall pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to a beneficial owner of this Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment with respect to this Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a "net payment" on this Note means a payment by the Company or a Paying Agent, including payment of R-2
principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on this Note. The Company shall not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (14) below. (1) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder or the beneficial owner: (a) having a relationship with the United States as a citizen, resident or otherwise; (b) having had such a relationship in the past; or (c) being considered as having had such a relationship. (2) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder or the beneficial owner: (a) being treated as present in or engaged in a trade or business in the United States; (b) being treated as having been present in or engaged in a trade or business in the United States in the past; or (c) having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States.

R-3
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.

(6) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the failure of the beneficial owner or any other person to comply with applicable certification, identification, documentation or other information reporting requirements. This exception to the obligation to pay Additional Amounts will only apply if compliance with such reporting requirements is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge. (7) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding from a payment on this Note by the Company or a Paying Agent. (8) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later. (9) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the presentation by the beneficial owner of this Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later.

(11) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment of principal or interest on this Note if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent. (12) Additional Amounts will not be payable where withholding is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. (13) Additional Amounts will not be payable on a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union. (14) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on this Note is reduced as a result of any combination of items (1) through (13) above. Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.
