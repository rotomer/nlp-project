Exclusivity Provisions Each Company's customers will remain free to buy and sell any CSDs of any third party. The Companies will not require a customer not to list, purchase, or sell CSDs of a third party or offer any payment or other advantage conditioned on a customer's committing not to do so. 2.

-5 flavour category) or offer any payment or other advantage conditioned on such purchasing obligation. 3. Transparency The Companies' agreements will reflect the following principles: - Transparency of Performance Obligations. Where an agreement offers a payment or other advantage in exchange for a customer's agreeing to carry out a service in relation to the sale of CSDs (i.e., pay-for-performance), both the service and the associated payment will be clearly specified by a Company in the relevant agreement. - Transparency of Termination Obligations. Where an agreement allows a customer either to terminate that agreement or to reduce its commitments to a Company pursuant to that agreement, the requirements for early termination or reduction of the customer's obligations will be clearly specified, including the basis for the calculation of any payment or payments owed to the Company. 4. Target Rebates No Rebates will be conditioned on a customer's reaching individually set purchase thresholds during a prescribed reference period for any product or product group that includes TCCC-Branded CSDs or on achieving purchase thresholds or growth rates calculated by reference to purchases of any product or group of products that includes TCCC-Branded CSDs made in a previous reference period. 5. Tying Provisions The Companies will not enter into or maintain in force in any agreement provisions that condition the supply of any TCCC-Branded Cola CSD or TCCC-Branded Orange CSD upon agreement by a customer to purchase one or more additional TCCC-Branded beverages. 6.

Agreements Concerning Products of Other Suppliers The Companies will not enter into or maintain in force in any agreement provisions that condition the supply of any TCCC-Branded CSD or the availability or extent of any payment or other advantage on the customer's obligation to discontinue, reduce, or vary the terms of any agreement or commercial relationship with any other supplier. B.

The Companies will not condition Shelf Space Commitments for TCCC-Branded Cola CSDs on a customer's providing a proportion of its permanent ambient-temperature CSD sales space in excess of the national share of CSD sales accounted for by TCCC-Branded Cola CSDs in the previous year, less 5% of that share, as measured by AC Nielsen. - TCCC-Branded Orange CSDs.

-7- and Public and Private Tender Agreements, concerning each Company's dealings with On-Premise customers in the Countries. 1.

This exclusion will apply only to events that do not exceed sixty days per year, which need not be consecutive. 2.

E. TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT PLACEMENT The commitments in this section will be applicable to commercial arrangements concerning the installation and use of technical equipment, other than as agreed in Sponsorship Agreements and Public and Private Tender Agreements, to the exclusion of any inconsistent provisions in this Undertaking. 1. Beverage Coolers The Companies' policies for the placement of Beverage Coolers will be based on the following principles: - Rent-Free Placement. Where a Company provides a Beverage Cooler on a rent-free basis, a customer may be required to stock that Beverage Cooler only with beverages distributed by the Company placing the equipment, provided the customer has other installed chilled beverage capacity in the outlet to which the consumer has direct access. Where a Beverage Cooler is provided on a rent-free basis and the customer does not have other installed chilled beverage capacity in the outlet to which the consumer has direct access, the customer will be free to use at least 20% of that Beverage Cooler's capacity for any products of its choosing. - Rental Placement. Where a Company provides a Beverage Cooler in exchange for rental payments, a customer will be free to stock any products of its choosing in at least 20% of the capacity of the rented Beverage Cooler.

The duration of purchase commitments for products sold through fountain dispensers provided by each Company will not exceed three years. - Customer Option To Terminate. Customers will have the option to terminate such purchase commitments without penalty with effect at any time following an initial term not exceeding two years.

Vending Machines No agreement under which a Company provides CSD vending machines to a customer (i.e., where the vending machine is provided either directly to an outlet or to an independent vending operator or wholesaler) will require or provide payments or other incentives for the customer to refrain from placing competing vending machines on any premises. III. IMPLEMENTATION A. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Undertaking comprises the entire extent of the Companies' commitments to or agreements or understandings with the European Commission and supersedes all prior undertakings entered into or agreements or understandings with the European Commission by any of the Companies. B. SCOPE OF APPLICATION The Companies will be bound by this Undertaking. To ensure that this Undertaking is implemented by all Bottlers in all Countries, TCCC will use its best efforts to ensure that, within 90 days of the Effective Date, all such Bottlers (other than the Companies) sign both this Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement committing them to abide by the Undertaking's terms if and as it applies to Countries and Channels in which they sell TCCC-Branded CSDs. Such best efforts will include informing each such Bottler that, should it fail to sign both the Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement
-10- committing it to abide by its terms, TCCC will exercise its right to terminate the relevant Bottler's Agreement. In the event that any such Bottler does not sign both this Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement committing it to abide by the Undertaking's terms, TCCC will serve written notice terminating the relevant Bottler's Agreement within 120 days of the Effective Date. TCCC will use its best efforts to procure, by the Full Implementation Date, the commitment of all Bottlers (other than the Companies) that are not subject to the Undertaking, by reason of the fact that their respective territories in the Relevant European Countries are not Countries, to implement this Undertaking immediately on their territories in the Relevant European Countries becoming Countries. Such best efforts will include informing each such Bottler that, should it fail to sign both the Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement committing it to abide by its terms, TCCC will exercise its right to terminate the relevant Bottler's Agreement. In the event that any such Bottler does not sign both this Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement committing it to abide by the Undertaking's terms, TCCC will serve written notice terminating the relevant Bottler's Agreement within 30 days of the Full Implementation Date. Any company that becomes a Bottler in a Country after the Effective Date will be required, as from the date of becoming a Bottler, to comply with this Undertaking and, notwithstanding Section III.C below, to implement the terms of this Undertaking immediately. Any company that, after the Effective Date, becomes a Bottler in a Relevant European Country that is not a Country because the applicable thresholds are not met will be required, as from the date of becoming a Bottler, to sign both this Undertaking and a Bottler's Agreement committing it to abide by the Undertaking's terms and, notwithstanding Section III.C below, to implement the terms of this Undertaking immediately on their territory becoming a Country. Upon committing to implement the terms of this Undertaking, any non-Company Bottler in a Country will be treated as a Company for purposes of this Undertaking. C.

-11- have nine months from the date on which the report is submitted to bring all existing agreements in a Country or Channel into compliance with this Undertaking. D. CHANGES IN APPLICABILITY Where a Country or Channel ceases to be subject to this Undertaking because the applicable thresholds are no longer met, the relevant provisions of the agreements of the Company in question will not be subject to this Undertaking from the date on which the reports referred to in Section III.E.2 below are provided to the Commission. E. REPORTING 1. Notice of Third Party Actions Each Company will provide the Commission with written notice promptly upon becoming aware that any third party has commenced an action before a competent regulatory authority or court alleging that it has violated any of the terms of this Undertaking. 2. Scope Each Company will be responsible for identifying among its territories in Relevant European Countries those Countries and Channels to which this Undertaking will be applicable. TCCC will provide the European Commission annually with written reports listing such Channels and Countries. Such reports will be accompanied by the market share information (currently available from A.C. Nielsen and Canadean Limited) on which they are based and an explanation of the conclusions reached as to the application of this Undertaking. TCCC will deliver such written reports to the European Commission within 30 days of the publication of the market share information (currently available from A.C. Nielsen and Canadean Limited) on which those reports are based. 3.

The full text of this Undertaking and a list of Countries and Channels in which it is applicable will remain prominently present on the website (or the parts thereof that are addressed to customers) of each Company. G. DURATION AND REVIEW 1. Duration This Undertaking will remain in force for a period of five years following the Full Implementation Date. 2. Periodic Review Any Company may seek review with the European Commission of the application of any provision of this Undertaking to it in light of any material changes in law or market circumstances or to alleviate any unforeseen hardship that might make appropriate some exception or modification of its terms, including, by way of example, in situations where market conditions in a Country, Channel, or Bottler territory would make application of any of the Undertaking's terms unwarranted. The European Commission will retain discretion to decide upon any such application. H. GOVERNING LANGUAGE In the event of any dispute, the English-language version of this Undertaking will be dispositive.

Exhibit 99.2 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY NEWS RELEASE Media Relations Department P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, Georgia 30301 Telephone (404) 676-2121 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Jon Chandler Brussels 32 (0) 2 6459859 Ben Deutsch Atlanta (404) 676-2683 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ANNOUNCES DRAFT SETTLEMENT DECISION WITH THE COCA-COLA COMPANY ------------------------------------------------- BRUSSELS, Oct. 19, 2004 -- The European Commission today announced that it has accepted a wide-ranging Undertaking from The Coca-Cola Company and its EEA bottlers relating to various commercial practices that have been under investigation since 1999. The Commission intends publishing this Undertaking under its new antitrust Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 for third-party comments before becoming final. Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Company, was in Brussels today to meet with Commissioner Monti and to present the Undertaking on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company and its EEA bottlers. Mr. Isdell commented: "We welcome the Commission's announcement today. The commitments given by the Company and its bottlers meet their concerns and will bring an end to the investigation. We are confident that we have demonstrated our commitment to finding solutions that address the Commission's concerns. We have always sought to compete fairly in an increasingly competitive European non-alcoholic beverage marketplace, and I believe this Undertaking provides clarity to the application of Community competition rules to our commercial practices. We look forward to a constructive and close working relationship with the European Commission in the future." Over the past five years, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission has been conducting an investigation into various commercial practices of The Coca-Cola Company and certain Coca-Cola Bottlers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Great Britain. - more -
Page 2 of 3 In the last few months, The Coca-Cola Company and certain of its Bottlers began a dialogue with the Commission Services to identify and address the commercial practices understood to be under review. During the summer, the Companies submitted draft proposals addressing all such practices. The Commission subsequently shared these proposals with retailers and other beverage suppliers involved in the non-alcoholic beverage market. The Companies were informed that the Commission considered the Undertaking fully responsive to the matters under investigation. The Undertaking will potentially apply in 27 EEA countries and in all channels of distribution where the carbonated soft drinks of The Coca-Cola Company account for over 40 percent of national sales and twice the nearest competitor's share. It will take more than 12 months to fully implement the Undertaking and for the market to react to any resulting changes. The commitments relate broadly to exclusivity, percentage-based purchasing commitments, transparency, target rebates, tying, assortment or range commitments and agreements concerning products of other suppliers. The Undertaking will also apply to shelf space commitments in agreements with take-home customers and to financing and availability agreements in the on-premise channel. In addition, the Undertaking includes commitments that will be applicable to commercial arrangements concerning the installation and use of technical equipment (i.e., coolers, fountain equipment, and vending machines). The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. Along with Coca-Cola, recognized as the world's best-known brand, the Company markets four of the world's top five soft drink brands, including diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, and a wide range of other beverages, including diet and light soft drinks, waters, juices and juice drinks, teas, coffees and sports drinks. Through the world's largest distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the Company's beverages at a rate exceeding 1 billion servings each day. - more -
