EXHIBIT 99.1 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Department P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, GA 30301 Telephone (404)676-2121 CONTACT: Media: Ben Deutsch (404) 676-2683 Investors: Ann Taylor (404) 676-5383 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY UPDATES LONG-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS AND OUTLINES INITIAL OPERATIONAL ACTIONS --------------------------------------------------------- - Long-term financial growth rate objectives include volume growth of three to four percent, operating income growth of six to eight percent and earnings per share growth in the high single-digits. - Permanent step up in annual marketing and innovation investments of $350 - $400 million beginning in 2005. - Continued weak performance in certain key markets expected in 2005 as operational issues are addressed. ATLANTA, Nov. 11, 2004 - At a meeting with the financial community to be held later today, The Coca-Cola Company's chairman and chief executive officer Neville Isdell and members of senior management will discuss the findings from an initial strategic and operational review and an assessment of the Company's opportunities and challenges. Mr. Isdell commented, "When I returned to The Coca-Cola Company, I did so determined to help lead the greatest company I know to ever higher levels of profitable growth, and fully utilize all of our core assets - including our world-leading brands, our unparalleled distribution system and our strong cash flow. At the outset, I recognized that meeting this objective would require a relentless focus on execution as well as the - more -
Page 2 of 4 patience to get the basics right. Following our strategic and tactical review, we are now prepared to commit to key targets and launch our initial corrective steps to assure that we realize our potential." Specifically, Mr. Isdell will outline in the meeting the Company's initial operational actions focused on: reestablishing marketing leadership; unleashing the potential of the Coca-Cola system; executing with excellence worldwide; and revitalizing the organization. Increased Investments - --------------------- To realize the full potential of its brands and generate sustainable growth rates, Mr. Isdell has concluded that the Company needs to increase annual investment levels on a permanent basis. The review has resulted in a decision for a permanent increase in marketing and innovation expenses of $350 - $400 million. A major portion of the investment will fund media behind core brands globally and support emerging high-growth market opportunities and the innovation pipeline. A second portion will go to programs to develop organizational capabilities, including revenue growth management, innovation capabilities, and training and development to rebuild the Company's bench strength. Long-Term Financial Growth Rate Targets - --------------------------------------- Based on historical and forecasted Company and industry trends as well as reviews of the operating business plans, Mr. Isdell has established new long-term financial growth rate objectives. The new targets are not a projection or forecast for any given time period. The Company's revised annual volume target is three to four percent growth over time. As will be detailed further in today's meeting, the Company is targeting annual operating income growth of six to eight percent and earnings per share growth in the high single digits. "As we have assessed our future growth opportunities, we believe we have outlined realistic and achievable financial growth targets over time. We believe that once we take the necessary steps to get back on our path to growth, our Company will be well positioned to reach these targets," concluded Mr. Isdell. - more -
Page 3 of 4 Outlook - ------- Beyond 2004, the Company's policy of not providing specific annual or quarterly earnings per share guidance will continue. However, the Company will still provide perspectives on key trends and business conditions that are important to understanding its business performance including perspectives for 2005. Based on Mr. Isdell's initial assessment from the business planning process and the work from the projects mentioned above, the Company does not regard its long-term growth rate targets as being applicable in 2005. The following factors should be considered in a review of the Company's outlook for 2005: - 2004 Results - Guidance for 2004 earnings per share provided on October 21, 2004, has not changed. - Challenges in Key Markets - The Company expects continuing weak results in certain key markets to persist into 2005 as it begins to address operational issues. These markets include North America, Germany and the Philippines. - Increased Investments - As stated above, the Company expects a permanent step up in its annual level of marketing and innovation investments of $350 - $400 million in 2005. - Currency - Currencies are expected to have a slightly positive impact on results in 2005. However, the Company will decide during 2005 whether to reinvest any positive currency benefits once those benefits have been realized. Investor Discussion - ------------------- The Company will host a discussion with investors and financial analysts today, November 11, 2004, at approximately 9:00 a.m. (EST). The Company invites investors to listen to the live audiocast of the discussion at the Company's website, www.coca-cola.com in the "investors" section. - more -

EXHIBIT 99.2 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures, ratios and trends used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures can provide meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business. See the tables below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the year 1998 and 2003.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures, ratios and trends used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures can provide more meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because it provides a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability due to the fact that these items do not represent results from the fundamental operations of the Company. Further, the timeframe used is to provide historical perspective to investors. See the Table below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the fourteen year period from 1990 to 2003. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COCA-COLA COMPANY RECONCILIATION OF ONGOING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE * Per share amounts may not add due to rounding. ** Compounded Annual Growth Rate 1990 - ---- Gain - ---- Gain on our investment in BCI Securities L.P. - $0.01 per share.
