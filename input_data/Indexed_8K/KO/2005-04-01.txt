Item 1.01 Entry into a Definitive Material Agreement. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company approved an amendment to the form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement (Performance Share Unit Agreement) to reflect an error in connection with the intended treatment at retirement. Under the revised agreement, in the event of Retirement, if the award has been held for at least twelve months, the target award will be granted (not prorated), but the shares will continue to be subject to restrictions until the end of the performance period. After certification of results for the performance period, all, a portion, or none of the award will be released, as determined by the underlying performance of the business. No more than the target number of shares may be awarded to the retiree, even if Company performance would have warranted a higher award. The terms will apply to the December 2004 grant, as originally intended. A copy of the revised form of Restricted Stock Agreement (Performance Share Unit Agreement) in connection with the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan of The Coca-Cola Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (1) If all of the conditions set forth in this Agreement are satisfied, an award of restricted Shares under the Plan will be made to the Recipient on the Grant Date. No Shares will be delivered to the Recipient or transferred into the Recipient's name until the Grant Date and the Recipient shall have no rights to any Shares or any rights associated with such Shares (such as dividends or voting rights) until the Grant Date. Shares will be delivered to the Recipient or the Recipient's estate on the Release Date indicated above on which the Shares cease to be subject to risk of forfeiture pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If the Recipient is resident outside of the United States on the Grant Date, the Compensation Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, may select an alternate Grant Date which is not later than the Release Date. If the Compensation Committee (or its designee) selects such an alternate Grant Date, the Recipient will receive from Recipient's employer a cash payment, less all applicable taxes, equal to the dividend that would be paid on an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock, beginning at the time a dividend would have been paid had Shares been Granted on the original Grant Date listed above. (a) Performance Conditions for the Award. An award of restricted Shares on the Grant Date shall be made only if the Recipient is, and has continuously been, employed by the Company or a Related Company since the date of this Agreement, except as provided in paragraph (1)(c). In addition, the award shall be made only if (and to the extent) that the Performance Criteria, set forth above, are satisfied during the Performance Period. The Controller of the Company and the Compensation Committee shall certify whether, and to what extent, the Performance Criteria have been achieved. (b) Conditions for Release of the Award. The Shares shall be delivered on the Release Date only if the Recipient, on the Release Date, is, and has continuously been since the date of this Agreement, employed by the Company or a Related Company, except as provided in paragraph (1)(c). (c) Separation from the Company. If any of the circumstances listed below occur prior to the Release Date, the terms of this subparagraph shall apply. The following table describes the Recipient's treatment depending on the reason for the Recipient's separation from the Company and the timing of the event. 3 -HIGHLY RESTRICTED- 4 -HIGHLY RESTRICTED-
(i) Where a cash payment is provided, the value of the Shares will be determined using the closing price per share, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing on the applicable date (as defined according to the relevant situation above), or, if the New York Stock Exchange is not open for trading on such date, the trading date immediately preceding the applicable date. The cash payment will be subject to all applicable tax withholdings and made as soon as administratively feasible. 5 -HIGHLY RESTRICTED-
(ii) Where references are made to a prorated award in the chart above, except where otherwise expressly provided, the proration shall be determined using a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of the event (e.g., death, Disability, transfer, involuntary separation or Retirement) and the denominator being the number of months in the Performance Period. (iii) For purposes of determining "Disability," the definition of "Disability" as contained in Section 5(a) of the Plan is replaced with the following definition: "Disability" shall mean a condition for which a Participant becomes eligible for and receives a disability benefit under the long term disability insurance policy issued to the Company providing Basic Long Term Disability Insurance benefits pursuant to The Coca-Cola Company Health and Welfare Benefits Plan, or under any other long term disability plan which hereafter may be maintained by the Company.

Notwithstanding the above, if an employee receiving serial severance benefits would have been eligible for Retirement as defined above had the employee continued his employment for a period equal to the period of the severance benefits, the employee will be deemed retired under this plan as of the date severance benefits begin. For purposes of determining whether an award has been held for at least 12 months and for determining the date of the release of Shares, the date of Retirement shall be the last day the Recipient actively works prior to Retirement. The Retirement date is not extended if the Recipient receives serial severance benefits. (vi) If there is more than one reason for separation, the following provisions apply. A) If a Recipient is eligible for Retirement and is involuntarily separated (other than for Cause), the provisions governing Retirement shall apply. B) If a Recipient is eligible for Retirement and is transferred to a Related Company, the provisions governing transfer to a Related Company shall apply. C) If a Recipient is disabled and is eligible for Retirement, the provisions governing Disability shall apply. 6 -HIGHLY RESTRICTED-
(vii) If a Recipient transfers to a Related Company and the Company deems that the continuation of the Performance Period or any other terms of this Agreement would create a conflict of interest, the Company reserves the right to take any actions with respect to the Shares, including but not limited to providing a cash payment, releasing Shares at an earlier date or modifying the Performance Period with respect to such Recipient. (viii) For purposes of determining whether an award has been held for at least 12 months in the case of involuntary separation, the date of involuntary separation shall be the last day the Recipient actively works prior to separation. The separation date is not extended if the Recipient receives serial severance benefits. (d) Recipient shall have no rights with respect to the Shares, including but not limited to rights to sell, vote, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Shares until the Grant Date. Between the Grant Date and the Release Date, Recipient shall have no right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Shares.

(e) The Recipient shall indicate his or her acceptance of this Agreement by signing and returning this Agreement by the Acceptance Date indicated above. (f) In the event that the Company's shares, as a result of a stock split or stock dividend or combination of shares or any other change or exchange for other securities, by reclassification, reorganization or otherwise, are increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company or of another corporation, the number of Shares to be awarded under this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect such change in such manner as the Board of Directors of the Company or the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate. If any such adjustment shall result in a fractional share, such fraction shall be disregarded. (g) The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the number of Shares or payments provided to a Recipient under this Agreement if it determines that a Recipient has failed to meet any other applicable performance standards (including but not limited to, compliance with the Company's Code of Business Conduct and any applicable laws), or if the Recipient owes any money to the Company or a Related Company and has failed to repay such obligation. 7 -HIGHLY RESTRICTED-
