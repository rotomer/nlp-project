Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 The European Commission announced today that it had adopted a Commitment Decision concerning the commercial practices of The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers in the European Economic Area.
ATLANTA/BRUSSELS, June 22, 2005
 
The Decision taken today is based on an Undertaking that The Coca-Cola Company and its major European bottlers filed with the Commission in October 2004.  Today's Decision, which follows consultation with the European Commission and the National Competition Authorities of the EU Member States, completes that procedure.  The Undertaking will apply across 27 countries in Europe, in all channels of distribution where the carbonated soft drinks of The Coca-Cola Company account for over 40% of national sales and twice the nearest competitor's share.
 
Mr. Neville Isdell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company, commented:  "We welcome today's decision, which marks the conclusion of a six-year investigation.  Throughout the process, we and our European bottlers have been committed to a constructive dialogue with the Commission Services and to finding solutions that would meet the Commission's concerns.  As a result of the Commission's Commitment Decision, which follows
 
the draft Undertaking that we submitted last October to former Commissioner Monti, we now have clarity regarding the application of European competition rules to our commercial practices in the European Economic Area."
