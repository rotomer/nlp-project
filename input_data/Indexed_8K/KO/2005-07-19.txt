Other Items
 
As previously announced, effective May 1, 2005, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure impacting its Europe, Eurasia and Middle East operating segment and its Asia operating segment.  The Company has replaced these operating segments with three new operating segments, the European Union segment, the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East segment, and the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim segment.  The European Union segment includes the Company's operations in all of the current member states of the European Union as well as the European Free Trade Association countries. The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East segment includes the Company's China, Japan, and Eurasia and Middle East Divisions, the markets of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and other European countries not in the European Union segment. The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim segment includes the Company's India, Philippines, Southeast and West Asia, and South Pacific and Korea Divisions.
 
Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto sets forth a schedule of unaudited reclassified operating segment data reflecting the revised operating segments.

Reclassified Operating Segment Data

Reclassified Operating Segment data reflects changes in the Company's Operating Segments which became effective
May 1, 2005.
For additional information about our sales volume, refer to page 46 of our 2004 Form 10-K filed on March 4, 2005.
 
(1)  Unit case volume growth based on average daily sales is computed by comparing the average daily sales in the quarter. Average daily sales for each quarter are the actual unit cases shipped during the quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter.
 
(2)  Reported unit case volume growth is computed by comparing the actual unit cases shipped in the corresponding period to the actual unit cases shipped in the prior-year corresponding period.  For the year 2003, the difference in the number of days in the periods for 2003 and 2002 were immaterial.  In the first quarter of 2004 these amounts are more than the amounts computed on an average daily sales basis because of more shipping days in the first quarter of 2004 as compared to the first quarter of the prior year.  The difference in days was partially offset in the fourth quarter of 2004.  In the first quarter 2005, these amounts are less than the amounts computed on an average daily sales basis because of fewer shipping days in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004.  The difference in days will be partially offset in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
(3)  Gallon sales and unit case volume are not necessarily equal during any given period.  Items such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases and new product introductions can create differences between gallon sales and unit case volume.
