 The Coca-Cola Company today reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.54, compared with $0.39 for the prior year third quarter.  Third quarter reported earnings per share included a net charge of $0.03 per share due primarily to a $0.04 non-cash charge related to asset write-downs in the Philippines, partially offset by a $0.01 per share benefit related to the favorable resolution of tax matters.
ATLANTA, Oct. 20, 2005
Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "This quarter demonstrates early progress in our efforts to achieve sustainable growth for the future.  We continue to see good results in many markets, including Latin America, Africa, Russia, Turkey, central Europe, Japan and China, and stabilization in an increasingly focused North America.  However, we still have considerable work ahead of us in other markets such as the Philippines, India and Germany, as well as to address current category trends in northwest Europe.  In addition, we are monitoring the potential impact of energy costs and macro-economic trends on consumer sentiment and disposable income. As we close out 2005 and move into 2006, we will continue to lay the foundation for sustainable growth over the coming years."

Total Company
 
Unit case volume increased 5 percent in the third quarter and 5 percent year-to-date.  For the quarter, the Company maintained share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. 
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume growth in the quarter was led by a 6 percent increase achieved by International Operations, reflecting double-digit growth in key emerging markets
 - 
                 
including China, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the Middle East.  In addition, Japan, Mexico, Brazil and North America delivered solid unit case volume growth.  Offsetting the overall results for the quarter were unit case volume declines in Germany, the Philippines, India and northwest Europe.  Acquisitions, primarily of Multon, the Russian juice company, slightly benefited unit case volume growth in the quarter. 
 
Carbonated soft drink unit case volume grew 2 percent in the quarter, led by 3 percent growth in International Operations.  Trademark Coca-Cola unit case volume increased 2 percent for the quarter.   The Company maintained share in the carbonated soft drink category in the third quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume for noncarbonated beverages, excluding water, grew 13 percent for the quarter, led by 28 percent growth in the global POWERade trademark and 14 percent growth in the global Minute Maid trademark.  Tea led the 5 percent unit case volume growth in coffee and tea beverages.  In the quarter, the Company increasedshare in the sports drink and juices and juice drinks categories.  Share declined in the ready-to-drink coffee and tea category, but this is being addressed with new innovation.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume for water grew 21 percent for the quarter, driven by 37 percent growth in the global Dasani trademark, along with solid growth in many of the regional brands, including Ciel and Bonaqua.  For the quarter, shareincreased in this competitive category.
 - 
                 
 
North America
 
 
Unit case volume in the North America operating group for the quarter increased 3 percent due to solid growth in both Retail and Foodservice and Hospitality.  Net
 - 
                 
revenues for the quarter increased 8 percent, reflecting a 4 percent increase in gallon sales, improved pricing and mix, and a slight currency benefit.  Operating income growth in the quarter was impacted by the planned double-digit increase in marketing expense, offset by reduced expenses, primarily due to lower stock option compensation expense and the cycling of higher costs in the finished products business in the prior year.
 
The Retail division's unit case volume increased 4 percent in the quarter, reflecting 2 percent unit case volume growth in the bottler delivered business, along with double-digit gains in warehouse juice and water operations.
 - 
                 
 
The Foodservice and Hospitality division's unit case volume increased 3 percent in the quarter, reflecting improved year-over-year trends in restaurant traffic, slightly offset by softness in discretionary consumer restaurant spending as a result of higher fuel costs and the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
 - 
                 
 
Overall, carbonated soft drink unit case volume declined 1 percent in the quarter, reflecting soft category trends on regular carbonated soft drinks.  While diet and light product unit case volume was flat in the quarter, share gains in the diet segment were achieved.
 - 
                 
 
In noncarbonated beverages, both POWERade and Dasani trademarks grew unit case volume in excess of 30 percent in the quarter, supported by warm weather, and continued to deliver share gains.  Warehouse-delivered juices increased unit case volume by 11 percent in the quarter and also increased share in the category, driven by the performance of Minute Maid premium chilled orange juice.
 - 
                 
 
Packaging and product innovations advanced in line or ahead of expectations with Coca-Cola Zero, Diet Coke Sweetened with Splenda, Dasani flavors, Full Throttle and the POWERade "clutch" bottle.
 - 
                 
 
European Union
 
 
Unit case volume in the European Union operating group increased 1 percent in the third quarter as solid unit case volume growth in Spain and central Europe, which was up 4 percent and 8 percent, respectively, was partially offset by unit case volume declines in northwest Europe and Germany.  Net revenues increased 9 percent in the quarter, reflecting a 4 percent increase in gallon sales, due to timing, along with the positive impact of pricing, currency benefits, and the consolidation of the Bremen bottler in Germany.  Operating income growth in the quarter reflects the cycling of the prior year charge related to the impairment of intangible assets in Germany, partially offset by the planned increase in marketing and operating expenses.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume in Germany declined 1 percent in the third quarter due to the continued impact of the mandatory deposit legislation on the availability of one-way packages, along with overall industry weakness.   Limited availability has now been achieved in most discounters.   Although the German legislature passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that eliminated the "island solutions," the amendment allows for a transition period to last until mid-2006. Therefore, the Company expects the challenging environment in Germany to continue into next year.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume growth in northwest Europe declined 3 percent in the third quarter as soft overall retail and carbonated soft drink category trends impacted the results.  This weakness is expected to continue for the remainder of 2005.
 - 
                 
 
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East
 
 
The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating group increased unit case volume 17 percent for the quarter, with double-digit growth in China, Russia, Turkey and the Middle East and 4 percent growth in Japan.  In addition, the joint acquisition of Multon, with Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, S.A. in the second quarter of 2005, contributed to unit case volume growth in the quarter.  Net revenues for the quarter increased 3 percent, reflecting a 13 percent increase in gallon sales and a slight currency benefit, partially offset by negative country mix, as gallon sales growth in Japan was behind unit case volume growth, as previously communicated in the second quarter earnings release.  Operating income decreased 12 percent in the quarter reflecting the negative country mix, higher input costs in cost of goods sold and the planned increase of marketing and operating expenses.
 - 
                 
 
In Japan, unit case volume increased 4 percent in the quarter, cycling 8 percent growth in the prior year, as strong innovation helped drive results and led to overall share gains in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink category.  Hajime, a new green tea, drove share increase during the quarter in the highly competitive non-sugar tea category.  Aquarius Active Diet, launched in May, continued its strong growth and contributed to 21 percent unit case volume growth in the Aquarius trademark during the quarter.  Unit case volume of Georgia coffee grew 1 percent in the quarter following the relaunch in early September.  In the quarter, Sokenbicha, the blended non-sugar tea, was negatively impacted by the launch of Hajime, and Trademark Coca-Cola was negatively impacted by the cycling of the Coca-Cola C2 launch in the prior year.  Both Sokenbicha and Trademark

Coca-Cola continue to be a focus and will be supported with a strong calendar of marketing activities in 2006.
 
In China, third quarter unit case volume grew 23 percent, cycling 20 percent growth in the prior year quarter.  Carbonated soft drink unit case volume grew 17 percent in the quarter and delivered share gains.  The performance was led by 16 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 20 percent growth in Trademark Sprite.  Noncarbonated beverage unit case volume grew 46 percent, as the continued expansion of new products, including Nestea Ice Rush, Modern Tea Workshop and Orange Pulp by Minute Maid, drove the results and share increases.
 - 
                 
 
In Russia and Turkey, improving macroeconomic trends along with strong bottler execution and marketing led to share increases and double-digit unit case volume growth, cycling double-digit unit case volume increases from the prior year period.
 - 
                 
 
Latin America
 
 
The Latin America operating group delivered unit case volume growth of 5 percent in the third quarter with solid growth in all key markets.  Net revenues in the quarter increased 21 percent, reflecting a 5 percent increase in gallon sales, positive pricing and mix, and positive currency benefits.  Operating income in the quarter, which increased 14 percent, was negatively impacted by the planned increase in marketing expense.
 - 
                 
 
In Mexico, unit case volume increased 4 percent in the quarter because of the continued focus on driving personal consumption, supporting brand value at home and investing in new beverage categories.  The performance was driven by 3 percent unit case volume growth in carbonated soft drinks led by Brand Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light and Fanta.  In addition, noncarbonated beverage unit case
 - 
                 
volume increased 10 percent in the quarter, supported by the launch of multiple new beverages and the establishment of a dedicated sales company.  POWERade, Nestea, and new flavored waters under the Ciel brand drove the results.
 
In Brazil, unit case volume growth for the quarter was 7 percent, cycling 14 percent growth in the prior year quarter.  Carbonated soft drink unit case volume grew 7 percent in the quarter and continued to increase share, led by solid results in core brands.
 - 
                 
 
In Argentina, consumer marketing activities and bottler execution drove unit case volume growth of 4 percent, cycling 13 percent growth in the prior year quarter. 
 - 
                 
 
East, South Asia and Pacific Rim
 
 
The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating group's unit case volume declined 5 percent in the third quarter.  Unit case volume declines in India and the Philippines strongly impacted the results.  Net revenues in the quarter decreased 2 percent, reflecting a 5 percent decline in gallon sales, offset by positive currency benefits and pricing.  Operating income was further reduced by the planned increase in marketing expense for key countries and the non-cash charge for asset write-downs in the Philippines
 - 
                 
.
 
In India, unit case volume decreased 22 percent in the quarter, cycling 36 percent growth in the prior year.  Price increases to cover rising raw material and distribution costs and the lingering effects of the false pesticide allegations drove the declines.
 - 
                 
 
In the Philippines, affordability and availability issues continued to negatively impact performance, with unit case volume for the quarter declining 13 percent.
 - 
                 
 
The issues in India and the Philippines are being addressed; however, results from these markets are expected to remain weak for the remainder of 2005 and into 2006.
 - 
     
 
Africa
 
 
The Africa operating group delivered solid results as it continued to execute against key strategies.  Growth in South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt led to 6 percent unit case volume growth in the third quarter.  Net revenues in the quarter increased 12 percent, reflecting a 7 percent increase in gallon sales, positive currency benefits, and positive pricing and mix.  Operating income was impacted by the planned increase in marketing expense, offset by lower expenses primarily related to stock option compensation expense and currency benefits.
 - 
     
 
Carbonated soft drink unit case volume in Africa increased 5 percent, as core brands drove the growth with Trademark Coca-Cola and Sprite unit case volumes up 6 percent and 14 percent, respectively, in the quarter.
 - 
     
 
South Africa had another strong quarter with unit case volume growth of 14 percent led by a winter marketing campaign for Brand Coke, strong bottler execution and unseasonably warm weather.  Core brands grew 14 percent in the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume in Nigeria grew 7 percent in the quarter as strong marketing campaigns and bottler execution led to solid carbonated soft drink unit case volume growth.

Financial Review
 
Operating Results
 
Net operating revenues for the third quarter increased 8 percent to $6.0 billion, reflecting a 5 percent increase in gallon sales, a 1 percent favorable impact from pricing and mix and a 2 percent currency benefit.  The Company expects gallon sales growth in the fourth quarter to lag reported unit case volume growth, primarily due to the favorable timing of bottler orders as of the end of the third quarter and the cycling of higher gallon sales in the prior year fourth quarter.
 
The following reflects net operating revenues from the Company's operations:
 
 
Cost of goods sold increased 8 percent for the quarter, reflecting a 5 percent increase in gallon sales, a 1 percent increase from currency movements as well as increases in commodity-based inputs and higher freight costs.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 9 percent reflecting the planned increase in marketing and innovation activities and a 1 percent increase from currency movements.  Partially offsetting the increase were lower expenses, primarily related to lower stock option compensation expense and various small gains on land sales, and the cycling of increased costs in the finished products business in the prior year quarter.  The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter to be negatively impacted by the timing of innovation expenses and the cycling of lower marketing expenses in the prior year.  The Company had other operating charges in the third quarter amounting to $85 million pre-tax ($82 million after tax) related to asset write-downs in the Philippines.
 
Reported operating income for the quarter increased 36 percent, reflecting the increase in net revenues and the cycling of impairment charges in the prior year quarter, partially offset by the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the asset write-downs related to the Philippines in the current year quarter.  The
currency benefit to operating income in the third quarter was approximately 6 percent.  The Company currently expects currencies to provide a negligible impact in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a negative impact during 2006.
 
Equity income for the quarter increased 8 percent reflecting solid results from the bottling system throughout the world and the Multon joint venture.
 
Effective Tax Rate
 
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4 percent.  The rate was primarily impacted by an $18 million tax benefit from the resolution of tax matters
and the impact of a lower estimated full-year underlying effective tax rate than previously expected.  The Company is required to record income tax expense for the first nine months of the year based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year.  As discussed in the second quarter earnings release, the Company had previously estimated that its underlying effective tax rate on operations would be approximately 24 percent for the full year.  The Company now anticipates that the underlying effective tax rate for the full year 2005 will be approximately 23.5 percent, primarily because of the mix of profit contributions from lower taxed locations
.  To bring the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2005 in line with the Company's currently estimated full year underlying effective tax rate, the Company recorded income tax expense at an underlying effective tax rate of approximately 22.5 percent in the third quarter.
 
The Company decided in the first quarter of 2005 to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the United States of approximately $2.5 billion under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the "Act") and recorded a related tax provision in prior quarters.  The maximum amount that the Company can repatriate under the Act is $6.1 billion.  The Company approved in October, subject to Board of Directors approval later today, a plan to repatriate the remaining $3.6 billion.  Therefore, the Company would record a tax provision of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the additional repatriation.
 
In determining the quarterly provision for income taxes, the Company uses an annual estimated effective tax rate based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the
Company operates.  The impact of significant or unusual items and discrete events are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur.  The Company currently estimates its underlying effective tax rate on operations for 2005 to be approximately 23.5 percent, which does not reflect the impact of the Act and significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate quarter.
 
Prior Year Results
 
In 2004, the third quarter results included a reduction of approximately $0.11 per share for other operating charges related primarily to the impairment of intangible assets in Germany and the net impact of certain tax adjustments, primarily related to the impairments.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a net benefit of approximately $0.015 per share related to favorable tax settlements and a gain on the issuance of stock by an equity investee, partially offset by write-downs of various manufacturing investments.
 
New Operating Structure
 
As previously announced, effective May 1, 2005, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure impacting its Europe, Eurasia and Middle East operating group and its Asia operating group.  The Company has replaced these operating groups with three new operating groups, the European Union operating group, the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating group, and the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating group.  The European Union operating group includes the Company's operations in all of the current member states of the European Union as well as the European Free Trade Association countries.  The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating group includes the Company's China, Japan, Eurasia and Middle East, and Russia, Ukraine and Belarus Divisions, and other European countries not in the European Union operating group.  The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating group includes the Company's India, Philippines, Southeast and West Asia, and South Pacific and Korea Divisions.
Conference Call
 
The Company will host a conference call with financial analysts to discuss the third quarter and year-to-date 2005 results on October 20, 2005, at 8:00 a.m. (EST).  The Company invites investors to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call at the Company's website, www.coca-cola.com in the "Investors" section.  Further, the "Investors" section of the Company's website includes a disclosure and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used periodically by management when discussing the Company's financial results with investors and analysts.

is computed by comparing the average daily sales in each of the corresponding periods.  Average daily sales for each quarter are the actual unit cases shipped during the quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter.
Unit case volume growth based on average daily sales
 
is computed by comparing the actual unit cases shipped in the first nine months of 2005 to the actual unit cases shipped in the first nine months of 2004.  In the first nine months of 2005, these amounts are less than the amounts computed on an average daily sales basis because of two fewer shipping days in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004.  The difference in days will be partially offset in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Reported unit case volume growth
 
* For the third quarter, "unit case volume growth based on average daily sales" is identical to "reported unit case volume growth" because there are no differences in the number of days.  Therefore, a separate column is not included above for "reported unit case volume growth" in the third quarter.
