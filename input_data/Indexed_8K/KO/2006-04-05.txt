Item 1.01
 
Entry into a Definitive Material Agreement
On April 4, 2006, the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company (the "Company") adopted the Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of The Coca-Cola Company (the Compensation Plan). The Compensation Plan, which takes effect in 2006, consists entirely of equity-based remuneration payable only when the Company meets pre-defined performance targets. The Compensation Plan also provides the option for the Board of Directors to make a one-time cash award to any new Director. A copy of the Compensation Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The Compensation Plan grants directors equity share units each year equal to a flat fee of $175,000 payable only upon the attainment of pre-defined performance targets. When the performance target is met at the end of the performance period, the share units will be payable in cash. Should the performance target not be met, all share units and hypothetical dividends would be forfeited in their entirety.
The Compensation Plan replaces the existing compensation structure under which directors received an annual retainer of $125,000, of which $50,000 was paid in cash and $75,000 accrued in share units. This structure also provided additional fees for such duties as chairing board committees and attending board and committee meetings. All these fees have been eliminated under the Compensation Plan.
For 2006, the Board of Directors set an initial three-year performance target of 8 percent compounded annual growth in earnings per share.  The Company will use its 2005 earnings per share of $2.17 (after considering items impacting comparability) as the base for this percentage growth calculation.
The Board of Directors also amended The Coca-Cola Company Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors to permit deferrals of compensation received under the Compensation Plan. A copy of The Coca-Cola Company Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
