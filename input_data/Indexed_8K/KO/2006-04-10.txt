As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2006, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure primarily to establish a new, separate internal organization for its consolidated and unconsolidated bottling operations.  This new structure will result in the reporting of a Bottling Investments operating segment, along with the six existing geographic operating segments and Corporate, beginning with the first quarter of 2006.  Prior to this change in the operating structure, the financial results of the consolidated bottling operations and our proportionate share of the earnings of unconsolidated bottling operations were generally included in the geographic operating segments in which they conducted business.
 
Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto sets forth a schedule of unaudited reclassified operating segment data reflecting the new operating structure.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Unit Case Volume Growth Rate Based on Average Daily Sales (1)
 
 
Reported Unit Case Volume Growth Rate (3)
 
 
Gallon Sales Growth Rate (4)
 
 
Reclassified Operating Segment Data reflect changes in the Company's operating structure which became effective January 1, 2006.
 
For additional information about our sales volume, refer to page 41 of our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2006.
 
(1) Unit case volume growth based on average daily sales is computed by comparing the average daily sales in each of the corresponding quarters. Average daily sales for each quarter are the actual unit cases shipped during the quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter.
 
(2) Bottling Investments segment data reflect unit case volume growth for consolidated bottling operations only. Geographic segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas, both consolidated and unconsolidated.
 
(3) Reported unit case volume growth is computed by comparing the actual unit cases shipped in the period to the actual unit cases shipped in the prior-year corresponding period. In the first quarter of 2005 these amounts are less than the amounts computed on an average daily sales basis because of two fewer shipping days in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004. This difference in days was partially offset in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
(4) Unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Items such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases and new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and gallon sales and can create differences between unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates.
