 - 
                 
Worldwide unit case volume up 4 percent for the second quarter.
 
 - 
                 
Second quarter EPS of $0.78 benefiting from $0.04 for items impacting comparability; $0.74 before these items.
 
 - 
                 
8 percent growth in EPS in the quarter; 9 percent after considering items impacting comparability.
 
 The Coca-Cola Company today reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.78, including a net benefit of $0.04 per share primarily due to a gain from the sale of shares in the initial public offering of the Turkish bottler. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2005 were $0.72 and included a net benefit of $0.04 per share. Earnings per share increased 8 percent in the quarter and 9 percent after considering items impacting comparability.
ATLANTA, July 18, 2006
 
Chairman and CEO Neville Isdell said, "We delivered another quarter of solid growth based on balanced performance across our global markets as well as our product portfolio. Through effective execution of our strategy and investments in key marketing initiatives such as the World Cup, we delivered 4 percent unit case volume growth  3 percent in carbonated beverages and 5 percent in noncarbonated beverages. Continued strong growth in Brazil, China, Russia, as well as other emerging markets, in particular in Latin America, along with another solid quarter in North America and improved results in Europe drove our performance. Our results clearly demonstrate that the majority of our markets are performing well and more than offsetting the challenges we have in a few markets.
 
 
"We remain excited about the remainder of the year, as we maintain our focus on execution and continue to introduce successful beverages into key markets, such as the launch of Coca-Cola Zero in the UK, Germany, Spain and Belgium. We will also roll-out the "Coke Side of Life" campaign across the globe and continue to expand our portfolio. By leveraging proven successes across our system and course correcting in markets where challenges emerge, I have confidence that we will achieve our business objectives and, in doing so, create sustained growth and value for the benefit of our shareowners and other stakeholders."

Financial Highlights
 
Second quarter revenues increased 3 percent versus the prior year, reflecting a 5 percent increase in gallon sales and even pricing and mix, offset by a 2 percent decrease from structural changes, primarily from the change in the business model in Spain, and a neutral currency impact.
 - 
                 
 
Operating income in the quarter increased 3 percent; 7 percent excluding items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability negatively affected operating income for the second quarter 2006 by $31 million pre-tax and positively impacted the second quarter of 2005 by $42 million pre-tax. Currency had a negative 1 percent impact.
 - 
                 
 
The Company repurchased $666 million of its stock in the second quarter and intends to repurchase $2.0 to $2.5 billion of its stock for the full year.
 - 
                 
 
Operational Highlights
 
(All references to unit case volume percentage changes in this section are computed based on average daily sales. Group operational highlights are reported in line with the Company's operating structure as described in the Company's Form 8-K filing dated April 10, 2006.)
Total Company
 
Unit case volume increased 4 percent in the second quarter and 4 percent year-to-date.
 - 
                 
 
The unit case volume increase in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in key emerging markets, including China, Russia, Turkey, and Argentina. In addition, both North America and Latin America delivered another solid quarter of unit case volume growth and the European Union showed improved performance across all divisions. Offsetting these results were unit case volume declines in Japan, the Philippines, and India.
 - 
                 
 
The Company continued to deliver growth in carbonated beverages, which increased unit case volume more than 3 percent in the quarter. Key brands drove the results with Trademarks Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta growing unit case volume 3, 5 and 4 percent, respectively, in the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Trademarks POWERade and Dasani continued their double-digit growth in the quarter, which, along with mid-single digit growth in Trademark Minute Maid, contributed to 5 percent growth in noncarbonated beverages.
 - 
                 
 
The Company maintained volume share in carbonated soft drinks, sports and energy drinks, and packaged water and gained share in juice and juice drinks.
 - 
                 
 
North America
 
 
Unit case volume growth in the quarter of 2 percent for Retail and 1 percent for Foodservice and Hospitality led to a 2 percent unit case volume increase for the North America operating group, reaching the high end of North America's long-term growth target. Net revenues for the quarter increased 8 percent, reflecting a 4 percent increase in gallon sales, positive pricing and favorable mix. Despite higher input costs on the finished goods businesses, operating income increased 7 percent for the quarter, reflecting revenue growth and favorable operating expenses.
 - 
                 
Carbonated beverages unit case volume growth in the quarter was even as sustained innovation from the introduction of Vault and Black Cherry Vanilla Coca-Cola as well as the continued focus on energy drinks enabled the cycling of the Coca-Cola Zero launch in the prior year.
 - 
                 
 
Noncarbonated beverages unit case volume grew 7 percent in the quarter as Trademarks POWERade and Dasani continued their double-digit growth. Total juice unit case volume was flat in the quarter. Warehouse-delivered juice unit case volume was negatively impacted by price increases on Minute Maid to cover higher ingredient costs. This decline was offset by continued unit case volume growth in Trademark Simply and Odwalla juices, as well as, Foodservice and Hospitality juices.
 - 
                 
 
European Union
 
 
Unit case volume in the European Union operating group increased 3 percent in the quarter reflecting an improving trend for Germany and Northwest Europe and solid growth for Central Europe. Net revenues declined 12 percent, reflecting a 4 percent increase in gallon sales, positive pricing and mix, offset by a 15 percent negative impact from structural changes due to the change in the business model in Spain and a negative impact from currency. As noted in the Company's 2005 10-K, the Company transferred its canning rights to the Company's bottlers in Spain at the beginning of 2006. This change did not materially impact operating income for the group but did reduce net revenues and cost of goods sold by similar amounts. Operating income was even in the quarter, primarily reflecting the growth in gallon sales, positive pricing, unfavorable currency and the continued investment in key marketing initiatives.
 - 
                 
Unit case volume in Northwest Europe for the quarter increased low single digits as performance began to stabilize, particularly in Great Britain. The results reflected solid growth in both regular and light Coca-Cola brands and were supported by the launch of Coca-Cola Zero in Great Britain at the end of June.
 - 
                 
 
Unit case volume in Germany was even in the quarter, sequentially improving from the first quarter of 2006, and was led by growth of 3 percent on brand Coca-Cola. The results reflected the benefits of the World Cup marketing programs and the timing of the Easter holiday into the second quarter in 2006, offset by the impact of price increases taken in early June on selected take-home packages. For the full year, the Company still expects trends in Germany to stabilize, recognizing the uncertainties created by the implementation of the amended mandatory deposit legislation in mid-2006.
 - 
                 
 
North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East
 
 
The North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East operating group increased unit case volume 10 percent for the quarter, with double-digit growth in China, Russia, and Turkey, partially offset by a 6 percent decline in Japan. Net revenues for the quarter decreased 4 percent, reflecting a 10 percent increase in gallon sales offset by an unfavorable currency impact and negative country mix due to declines in the Japan business. Operating income decreased 6 percent for the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in revenues and increased marketing expenses.
 - 
                 
In Japan, unit case volume decreased 6 percent in the quarter primarily due to weakness in core brands, declines in the soft drink category related to poor weather conditions, and the cycling of strong product launches in the prior year. The relaunch of Georgia Coffee in May has started to gain traction resulting in improving unit case volume trends sequentially through the second quarter. In addition, the relaunch of Sokenbicha Original earlier in the year has resulted in continued growth in the quarter. Results for the remainder of the year are expected to remain weak but reflect an improving trend. A new structure is in place to focus on execution and drive improved results.
 - 
                 
 
In China, second quarter unit case volume grew 14 percent, cycling double-digit growth in the prior year quarter, led by double-digit growth in carbonated beverages which continued to gain share. Noncarbonated beverages unit case volume also continued to deliver strong double-digit growth.
 - 
                 
 
Latin America
 
 
The Latin America operating group delivered strong unit case volume growth of 7 percent in the quarter as solid growth in all key markets drove results. Net revenues increased 18 percent, reflecting a 7 percent increase in gallon sales, positive pricing and mix as well as currency benefits. Operating income increased 16 percent reflecting the net revenue increase, offset by the planned increase in marketing spend.
 - 
                 
In Mexico, unit case volume increased 5 percent in the quarter with a continued focus on driving personal consumption, supporting brand value at home and investing in new beverages. Carbonated beverages unit case volume grew 5 percent and gained share in the quarter driven by strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola.
 - 
                 
 
In Brazil, unit case volume growth for the quarter was 7 percent, cycling 17 percent growth in the prior year. Solid unit case volume growth in carbonated beverages drove the results, as strong marketing and execution led to continued share increases.
 - 
                 
 
In Argentina, consumer marketing activities and bottler execution drove unit case volume growth of 14 percent in the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
East, South Asia and Pacific Rim
 
 
The East, South Asia and Pacific Rim operating group's unit case volume decreased 10 percent in the quarter, primarily reflecting unit case volume declines in India and the Philippines. Net revenues for the quarter increased 9 percent, as positive pricing and strong product and country mix offset a 12 percent decrease in gallon sales. Operating income increased 4 percent primarily reflecting the net revenue growth partially offset by planned increases in marketing expenses.
 - 
                 
 
In India, unit case volume decreased 12 percent in the quarter, reflecting the impact of recent price increases and steps taken by the consolidated bottling operations to drive revenue growth and improve operating and working capital efficiencies. The Company expects volume results in India to begin to stabilize during the balance of the year.
 - 
                 
In the Philippines, unit case volume decreased high teens in the quarter as affordability and availability issues continued to negatively impact performance. The Company expects performance to remain weak during 2006 as the Company and its bottling partner work together to address the issues.
 - 
                 
 
Africa
 
 
The Africa operating group's unit case volume increased 7 percent, reflecting growth across all divisions and in particular strong growth in South Africa. Net revenues for the quarter increased 7 percent, primarily reflecting an 8 percent increase in gallon sales and slight favorable currency benefit being offset by negative mix. Operating income growth of 16 percent primarily reflects the increase in net revenues and effective management of expenses.
 - 
                 
 
Bottling Investments
 
 
The Bottling Investments operating group's unit case volume increased 2 percent in the quarter reflecting acquisitions of certain bottling investments. Net revenues increased 11 percent in the quarter due to the unit case volume increase, favorable pricing and mix, and positive currency impact. Operating income increased 64 percent in the quarter reflecting the focus on driving sustained financial growth through revenue increases and expense leverage.
 - 
                 
Financial Review
 
Operating Results
 
Net operating revenues for the quarter increased 3 percent versus the prior year as a 5 percent increase in gallon sales was offset by a 2 percent negative impact from structural change, primarily related to the change of the business model in Spain. Pricing and mix had a limited impact in the quarter primarily due to the unfavorable mix resulting from the decline in Japan. Currency had a negligible impact on net revenues in the quarter. The Company expects gallon sales growth in the remainder of the year to lag reported unit case growth, primarily due to favorable timing of bottler orders as of the end of the second quarter.
 
Cost of goods sold decreased 2 percent for the quarter, reflecting a 5 percent increase in gallon sales along with increases in commodity-based input and freight costs, offset by an 8 percent decrease due to structural changes, primarily related to the change of the business model in Spain and the cycling of the favorable high fructose corn syrup lawsuit settlement in the prior year.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 5 percent, reflecting continued investments in marketing and increased costs in the consolidated bottling operations, partially offset by effective management and timing of general and administrative expenses.
 
The Company had other operating charges in the second quarter amounting to $31 million pre-tax ($30 million after tax), primarily related to rationalizing production capacity.
 
Operating income for the quarter increased 3 percent, reflecting the growth in gross profit offset by the investments in marketing, the effect of items impacting comparability in both 2005 and 2006 and negative exchange. Excluding the items impacting comparability, operating income increased 7 percent for the quarter, including a 1 percent negative currency impact. Based on current spot rates and the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage in place, the Company currently expects the currency
impact to be approximately negative 1 percent for the full year, with most of the impact occurring in the first half of the year. The second quarter benefited from approximately $0.02 per share primarily related to the timing of gallons, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year.
 
The Company recorded a gain of $123 million pre-tax related to the sale of a portion of its ownership in the initial public offering of the Turkish bottler in May. The Company's ownership in the Turkish bottler is currently 20.5 percent.
 
Effective Tax Rate
 
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2 percent. The rate was affected by several items, including the benefit from the
tax expense on items impacting an equity investee recorded at an 8 percent rate and a tax benefit of $14 million related to the sale of a portion of the investment in the Turkish bottler, offset by a $22 million tax accrual for the anticipated future resolution of tax matters and the tax deduction on other operating charges recorded at a 2 percent rate. The underlying effective tax rate on operations was 24 percent in the quarter.
The
Company currently estimates its underlying effective tax rate on operations for 2006 to be approximately 24 percent, which does not reflect the impact of significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
 
New Operating Structure
 
As previously announced, effective January 1, 2006, the Company made certain changes to its operating structure to establish a new, separate internal organization for its consolidated bottling operations and its unconsolidated bottling investments. This new structure resulted in the reporting of a separate Bottling Investments operating segment, along with the six existing geographic operating segments and Corporate, beginning with the first quarter of 2006. Reclassified operating segment information can be found in the Company's Form 8-K filing dated April 10, 2006.
 
Transfer of Spain Canning Rights
 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company granted its bottling partners in Spain the rights to manufacture and distribute Company trademarked products in can packages. The Company will also reduce future marketing support payments to the bottlers. As
a result, a portion of the Company's business has essentially been converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model. This shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in a reduction of revenues. This change did not materially impact gross profit. Had the change occurred as of January 1, 2005, revenues for the six months ended July 1, 2005, would have been reduced by approximately $368 million, with no material impact to gross profit. This change will continue to affect the comparison of certain line items of the Company's statements of income over the remainder of 2006, but will not impact the Company's operating income.
 
Items Impacting Prior Year Results
 
In 2005, the second quarter results included a net benefit of $0.04 per share due to a gain from the favorable high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) lawsuit settlement, the favorable resolution of tax matters, a reduction of the tax accrual related to the repatriation of foreign earnings, and a benefit from certain items impacting an equity investee. In the first quarter of 2005, results included a net reduction of $0.05 per share due to a charge for accelerated amortization of stock-based compensation expenses and a tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by a benefit related to the favorable resolution of tax matters and a gain on the issuance of stock by an equity investee.
 
Conference Call

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. See the Table below for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Note:Items to consider for comparability include primarily charges, gains, and accounting changes. Charges and accounting changes negatively impacting net income are reflected as increases to reported net income. Gains and accounting changes positively impacting net income are reflected as deductions to reported net income.
