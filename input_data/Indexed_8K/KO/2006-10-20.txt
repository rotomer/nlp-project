Item 5.03.
 
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On October 19, 2006, the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company (the Company) approved amendments to Article I, Section 2 of the Companys By-Laws to change the vote standard for uncontested elections of directors from plurality to majority of the votes cast.
As amended, Article I, Section 2 of the By-Laws reads as follows:
 
"Section 2.
Voting.

Except as provided below, all actions
shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast unless a greater vote is required by the laws of Delaware. A shareholder may vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedures established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or the transmission that could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission
. A nominee for
director
election
shall be elected by the
affirmative
vote of
a
majority of the votes cast with respect to
such nominee

provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. In an election of directors, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a nominee must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to such nominee (excluding abstentions). If a director is not elected, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the resignation taking into account the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 100 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decisions of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the Board of Directors that concern such resignation. If a directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, Section 2 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article II, Section 1."

The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
 
The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to a proceeding to enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VII, the Company shall be required to indemnify a person under this Article VII in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
 
 
Section 2.
Expenses.
To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in part, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. The entitlement to expenses under this Section 2 shall include any expenses incurred by a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company in connection with any action, suit or proceeding brought by such director, officer, employee or agent to enforce a right to
 
 
9
 
 
indemnification or payment of expenses under this Article. If successful in whole or in part in any such action, suit or proceeding, or in any action, suit or proceeding brought by the Company to recover a payment of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking provided in accordance with Section 4, the director, officer, employee or agent also shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such action, suit or proceeding.
 
 
Section 3.
Procedure for Receiving Indemnification.
To receive indemnification under this By-Law, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to him and reasonably necessary to determine his entitlement to indemnification. Upon receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to a claimant's request shall be made: (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (4) by the shareholders. The determination of a claimant's entitlement to indemnification shall be made within a reasonable time, and in any event within no more than 60 days, after receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification, together with the supporting documentation required by this Section. The burden of establishing that a claimant is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Company.
 
 
Section 4.
Payment of Expenses.
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding within 30 days after receipt by the Company of a statement requesting payment of such expenses. Such statement shall evidence the expenses incurred by the claimant and shall include an undertaking by or on behalf of the claimant to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal, that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by this Article. The burden of establishing that a claimant is not entitled to payment of expenses under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Company. Any such payment shall not be deemed to be a loan or extension or arrangement of credit by or on behalf of the Company.
 
 
Section 5.
Provisions Non-Exclusive; Survival of Rights.
The indemnification and payment of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified or those who receive payment of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
 
Section 6.
Insurance.
The Company shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

Section 8.
Effect of Amendment.
Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.
 
 
Section 9.
No Duplication of Payments.
The Company's obligation, if any, to indemnify or pay expenses to any person under this Article shall be reduced to the extent such person has otherwise received payment (under any insurance policy, indemnity clause, bylaw, agreement, vote or otherwise).
