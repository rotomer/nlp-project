Item 1.01.               Entry Into a Definitive Material Agreement.
On December 22, 2006 (Eastern Standard Time), Coca-Cola South Asia Holdings Inc. (the "Purchaser"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company (the "Registrant"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with San Miguel Corporation ("SMC") and two subsidiaries of SMC (collectively, the "Sellers") to acquire all of the shares of capital stock of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. ("CCBPI") currently held by the Sellers (the "Shares"), representing 65 percent of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCBPI.  CCBPI is the Registrant's authorized bottler in the Philippines.  Upon the closing of the acquisition, the Registrant and its subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, will own 100 percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCBPI.
In consideration for the Shares and the other covenants and agreements of the Sellers, the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers an aggregate amount of US$590,000,000, subject to adjustment, as follows:
at the closing, the Purchaser will (i) pay to the Sellers an amount equal to US$370,000,000, and (ii) will deposit US$100,000,000 in escrow (the "Escrow Amount"), to be disbursed after the closing upon the resolution of the purchase price adjustment described below;
                 
on the day that is 18 months following the closing, the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers US$20,000,000, reduced by any amounts owing to or claimed by the Purchaser under a transition services agreement to be entered into at the closing, and will pay interest on this amount quarterly at a LIBOR-based rate; and
                 
on the day of the fifth anniversary of the closing, the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers US$100,000,000, reduced by any amounts owing or claims by the Purchaser under the Cooperation Agreement (as defined below), and will pay interest on this amount quarterly at a LIBOR-based rate.
                 
In the event that the net asset value of CCBPI and its subsidiaries (the "Closing NAV") calculated based on closing accounts agreed by the parties or determined as provided in the Purchase Agreement is lower than a base net asset value agreed by the parties (the "NAV Peg"), the purchase price will be reduced by 65 percent of the difference between the NAV Peg and the Closing NAV.  Conversely, in the event the Closing NAV is higher than the NAV Peg, the purchase price will be increased by 65 percent of the excess of the Closing NAV over the NAV Peg.  In either case, the purchase price adjustment will be satisfied solely from, and will be limited to, the Escrow Amount.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers agreed not to, and to cause SMC's subsidiaries not to, engage in, carry on, provide services to or otherwise be interested in the business of preparing, bottling, toll packing or otherwise packaging, distributing and/or selling, for themselves or for others,
2
any non-alcoholic beverages that are owned, manufactured or otherwise used or subsequently introduced or developed by certain competitors of the Registrant anywhere in the world for a period of three years from the closing and in the Philippines for a period of five years from the closing; or
                 
certain carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks and/or flavoured water in the Philippines for a period of five years from the closing.
                 
In addition, the Purchase Agreement contains various representations, warranties and covenants of the parties including, among others, representations and warranties by the Sellers with respect to CCBPI's business and financial condition, as well as indemnification provisions.
The closing of the acquisition is subject to certain conditions specified in the Purchase Agreement.
SMC and Purchaser also entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") pursuant to which (a) SMC agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, (i) comply with the non-compete obligations set forth in the Purchase Agreement and with any supply and service contracts between the parties; (ii) offer to the Company and its subsidiaries any requested goods or services on terms no less favorable than being offered to other customers; (iii) provide advice and recommendations on establishing and maintaining relationships with certain agencies; and (iv) reasonable assistance in transferring certain certificates of title, permits licenses or other similar items to the name of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and (b) the Company agreed to, and to cause it subsidiaries to, invite SMC or its subsidiaries to provide any goods and services required by the Company or any subsidiary and to award a contract for all or a portion of such goods and services to SMC or its subsidiaries if the terms offered are no less favorable then those being offered by other arms length suppliers.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and are hereby incorporated into this report by reference.
The Purchase Agreement, which has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contains representations and warranties of the Purchaser and the Sellers.  The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Purchase Agreement. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a shareowner might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.  Accordingly, investors should not view the representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on them as such.  Investors should read the Purchase Agreement together

with the other information concerning the Registrant contained in reports and statements that the Registrant files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the remaining Third Payment is less than the amounts referred to in clause 3.6(c), then the Sellers shall pay the Purchaser any amount owing to the Purchaser that cannot be deducted from the remaining Third Payment in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by the Purchaser.

In the event that a Notice of Breach under the Transition Services Agreement has been given to the Sellers for a claim that remains disputed, unremedied or unresolved by the Third Payment Date, the amount of such claim, together with any interest accruing thereon, shall be withheld by the Purchaser from the Third Payment. The disputed amount shall remain with the Purchaser and continue to earn interest in accordance with clause 3.6(b) until the remedy of the breach or resolution or settlement of the dispute in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement and shall:

The interest accrued to the Purchaser should be calculated using actual rates at which interest was paid to the Sellers, compounded on a quarterly basis.  However, in the event that the remaining Third Payment is less than the interest due to the Purchaser, then the Sellers shall pay the Purchaser any amount owing to the Purchaser that cannot be reduced from the remaining Third Payment in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by the Purchaser.

in giving such determination, the Closing Expert shall state what adjustments (if any) are necessary to the draft Closing Accounts in respect of the matters in dispute in order to comply with the requirements of this Agreement;

5.10

(a)

for a period beginning on Closing and ending 20 years after Closing ("Permit Indemnity Period"), the full amount of any loss (including any claim, penalty, damage or expense) suffered by any Group Company as a result of any failure of Sellers to maintain the permits still in the name of SMC or its relevant SMC Subsidiary that are listed in Schedule 15, while such permits have not been transferred to the relevant Group Company  20 years after Closing, and to transfer such permits to the relevant Group Company, provided in the event that Sellers cause the transfer of any permit to or the Purchaser undertakes to transfer any of such permits on its own initiative to the relevant Group Company within the Permit Indemnity Period, then, in each case, the obligation of Sellers to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of such transferred permits completed by the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall cease.
