Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning provided in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated into, and made a part of, this Agreement.

.
 
    (a)
 
General provisions
.
 
 
 
(b)
 
Specific provisions
.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, one fourth of the number of options covered by this Agreement shall vest on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.

How to exercise the options
.
 
In order to exercise an option, it must be vested and must not have expired, and the optionee must do the following:
(a)
Pay the option exercise price
. The optionee must pay the option exercise price. The optionee shall be informed of the acceptable form and method of payment at or before the time the optionee informs KO of his or her intention to exercise the option. The acceptable forms and methods of payment of the option exercise price may include payment in cash, pursuant to a cashless exercise authorized by KO, or by delivery, through attestation, of shares of KO common stock owned by the optionee. Not all forms and methods of payment are available in every country. The value of the shares delivered to pay the option exercise price shall be computed on the basis of the most recent reported market price at which a share of KO common stock shall have been sold prior to the time of processing the optionee's election to deliver shares in payment of the option exercise price, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing.
 
 
   
(b)    The optionee must complete, sign and return any paperwork required by KO or by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith ("Merrill Lynch"), or such other agent as may administer the option program on behalf of KO from time to time.
Complete all paperwork.
 
 (c)
   
Pay applicable taxes and fees
. The options are not intended to be, and shall not be treated as, incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
   The optionee must satisfy any tax withholding requirements regarding any applicable taxes. If the optionee is a U.S. taxpayer, he or she may elect to satisfy Federal, state and local income tax liabilities due by reason of the exercise by having shares of KO common stock withheld. The value of withheld shares shall be computed as described in paragraph 2(a) above.
 
               The optionee 
agrees that, should KO or any Related Company in its reasonable judgment determine that tax
               withholding 
is required upon exercise of the options, and if the optionee has not satisfied such tax obligation(s),
               then KO may instruct Merrill Lynch to withhold and/or sell shares of KO common stock acquired by the optionee
               upon exercise of his or her options, or KO may deduct funds equal to the amount of withholding tax (such amount
               to be determined by KO) from the optionee's salary or other funds due to the optionee from KO.
 
       Irrespective of KOs or a Majority Owned Related Companys action or inaction with respect to taxes or tax withholding, the optionee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any and all taxes is and remains the responsibility and liability of the optionee or the optionees estate. For optionees who are International Service Associates, all taxes remain the optionees responsibility, except as expressly provided in KOs International Service Policy and/or tax equalization program. Optionee acknowledges that KO and any Related Company (i) make no representations or undertaking regarding the amount or timing of any taxes, and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the option or any aspect of the transfer of the shares to reduce or eliminate the optionee's liability for taxes.
The optionee agrees to pay to Merrill Lynch any costs associated with the sale of shares of KO common stock acquired upon exercise of the options (whether such shares are sold to pay the option exercise price, to satisfy tax withholding requirements or for other reasons).
For employees in Switzerland, the optionee agrees that the taxation of the options will occur at the time the options are exercised.
(d)
Right of set-off
. By accepting this Agreement, the optionee agrees that, should KO or any Related Company in its reasonable judgment determine that optionee owes KO, any Related Company or any affiliate any amount due to any loan, note, obligation or indebtedness, including but not limited to amounts owed to KO pursuant to KOs tax equalization program or KOs policies with respect to travel and business expenses, and if the optionee has not satisfied such obligation(s), then KO may instruct Merrill Lynch to withhold and/or sell shares of KO common stock acquired by the optionee upon exercise of his or her options, or KO may deduct funds equal to the amount of such obligation from the optionee's salary or other funds due to the optionee from KO.
 
 
(e)  
Comply with additional restrictions
. The optionee agrees that the Committee, or its designee, may, in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion at or before the time the optionee informs KO of his or her intention to exercise the option, establish any additional conditions or restrictions with respect to the exercise of the option, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the acceptable form or method of payment of the option exercise price and restrictions for
 
failing to promptly submit to KO, any Related Company or any affiliate thereof, a tax organizer, or such other tax-related documents reasonably requested by KO or optionees employer, pursuant to KOs tax equalization program (if optionee is a participant in such program). The optionee shall be informed of such restrictions. The optionee agrees to comply with any such additional conditions or restrictions.
3. 
Options are not transferable
.
 
The optionee may not transfer the options; provided that upon the optionee's
death the  
     options may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the lifetime of the optionee, the 
     options shall be exercisable only by the optionee personally or, in the event of the optionee's Disability if a legal
     representative has been appointed to act on behalf of the optionee, then by the optionee's legal representative.
4. 
Forfeiture of options and option gain
.
 
In the event optionee shall engage in a Prohibited Activity (as defined on
      Schedule A hereto), at any time during the term of the options, or within one year after termination of optionees
      employment from KO or any Related Company, or within one year after exercise of all or any portion of the options,
      whichever occurs latest, this option shall be rescinded and, if applicable, any gain associated with any exercise of this
      option shall be forfeited and repaid to KO. Accordingly, if the optionee engages in a Prohibited Activity, then:
(a)   as of the date that the optionee participates in such Prohibited Activity, all unexercised portions of this option immediately and automatically shall terminate, be forfeited, and shall cease to be exercisable (unless such option has been terminated sooner by operation of another term or condition of the Plan or this Agreement); and
(b)   within ten days after receiving from KO written notice of the termination of this option, the optionee shall pay to KO any and all gains associated with the exercise of all or any portion of this option, plus interest calculated from the time of such notice through the date of repayment to KO. The gain associated with the exercise of any portion of this option shall be the closing price per share on the date of the exercise thereof, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing, less the option exercise price per share shown above, multiplied by the number of options exercised. Interest shall be calculated using the weighted prime rate at SunTrust Bank, Atlanta.
Optionee may be released from the effects of this Section 4 if the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such
action is in the best
interest of KO and its stockholders.
Optionee expressly acknowledges and affirms that the foregoing provisions of this Section 4 are material and important terms of this Agreement, and optionee expressly agrees that if all or any part or application of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4 are held or determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action between optionee and KO, KO shall be entitled to receive from optionee, in exchange for the exercise price per share shown above, all shares of KO common stock acquired by optionee upon exercise of any portion of the option and held by optionee. If optionee has sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of any shares of KO common stock acquired by optionee upon exercise of any portion of the option, KO shall be entitled to receive from optionee the gain associated with such sale, transfer or disposal, plus interest calculated through the date of payment to KO. The gain associated with the sale, transfer or other disposal of any share of KO common stock acquired by optionee upon exercise of any portion of the option shall be the closing price per share on the date of such sale, transfer or disposal, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing, less the option exercise price per share shown above, multiplied by the number of shares of KO common stock sold, transferred or disposed of. Interest shall be calculated using the weighted prime rate at SunTrust Bank, Atlanta.
