This Full and Complete Release and Agreement on Competition, Trade Secrets and Confidentiality is sometimes herein referred to as the Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that I do not hereby waive, but rather I have retained and shall continue to have all rights and entitlements to receive and the Company shall remain obligated to fully perform and pay (or cause to be performed or paid) (i) all amounts or payments owed to me as contemplated under the Separation Letter, (ii) all of my rights to seek and receive indemnification from the Company for and with respect to all acts, errors or omissions committed by me in my capacity as a shareholder, director, officer, employee, fiduciary, agent or representative of the Company all in the manner provided under the Companys by-laws (as hereinafter contemplated) and applicable law, and (iii) all of my accrued and vested benefits (including pension or deferred compensation benefits) as determined through and including the Effective Date under the Companys applicable and governing plans and programs including without limitation all rights received or attributable to any coverage extended me under any insurance policies maintained with or through third parties.
I fully understand and agree that:
1.
  
this Agreement is in exchange for severance benefits under the Company Severance Plan,
the payments and benefits described in the Separation Letter,
and other special compensation to which I would otherwise not be entitled;
2.
  
I am hereby advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Agreement;
3.
  
I have 21 days from my receipt of this Agreement
 
within which to consider whether to sign it;
4.
  
I have seven days following my signature of this Agreement to revoke the Agreement; and
5.
  
this Agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period of seven days has expired.
If I choose to revoke this Agreement, I must do so by notifying the Company in writing.
 
If there is any claim for loss of consortium, or any other similar claim, arising out of or related to my employment or separation of employment with the Company, I will indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any liability, including costs and expenses (as well as reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company as a result of any such claim.
 I additionally understand and agree that this Agreement is not and shall not be construed to be an admission of liability of any kind on the part of the Company or any of the other persons or entities hereby released.
   
Company Release
.
For and in consideration of my release of the Company under the preceding provisions and my undertaking of all covenants and agreements provided under this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the Company (as defined herein) does hereby knowingly and voluntarily release and forever discharge me and my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns (collectively the Executive Released Parties"), from all debts, claims, actions, causes of action, suits, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, covenants, contracts, claims for costs or attorneys' fees, controversies, agreements, promises, and all liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, at law, in equity, or otherwise, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, fixed or contingent, which the Company ever had, now have, or may have, or which the Company hereafter can, shall, or may have, from the beginning of time through and including the Effective Date, including without limitation those arising out of or related to my employment or my separation from employment with the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Company does not hereby waive, but rather the Company shall have retained and continue to have all rights and entitlements to enforce all of its rights and my obligations as against me as provided or contemplated under and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Separation Letter.
It is further understood and agreed that this Agreement is not and shall not be construed to be an admission of liability of any kind on the part of any one or more of the Executive Released Parties.
Future Cooperation
.
I covenant and agree that I shall, to the extent reasonably requested in writing, fully cooperate with the Company in any investigation and/or threatened or pending litigation (now or in the future) in which the Company is a party or by which the Company is directly affected, and regarding matters which I, by virtue of my employment with the Company, have knowledge or information relevant to said litigation, including, but not limited to (i) meeting with representatives of the Company to prepare for testimony and to provide truthful information regarding my knowledge, and (ii) providing, in any jurisdiction in which the Company requests, truthful testimony relevant to said litigation; provided that in all events the Company shall (a) reimburse me for actual and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation including all travel, lodging and accommodations, (b) remain and be exclusively responsible for all costs incurred in undertaking such litigation including all attorneys fees, court costs, and other expenses consistent with the Companys by-laws, and (c) notify me as promptly as possible as to its need for my assistance and cooperate with me in scheduling my participation so as to reasonably accommodate my other personal and professional obligations and commitments.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
.
I covenant and agree that I have held and shall continue to hold in confidence all Trade Secrets of the Company that came into my knowledge during my employment by the Company and shall not disclose, publish or make use of at any time such Trade Secrets for as long as the information remains a Trade Secret. "Trade Secret" means any technical or non-technical data, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, drawing, process, financial data, financial plan, product plan, list of actual or potential customers or suppliers or other information similar to any of the foregoing, which (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can derive economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.
I also covenant and agree that, for the period beginning on the date I sign this Agreement and ending on February 28, 2009 (the Nondisclosure Period), I will hold in confidence all Confidential Information of the Company that came into my knowledge during my employment by the Company and will not disclose, publish or make use of such Confidential Information.

The restrictions stated in this Agreement are in addition to and not in lieu of protections afforded to trade secrets and confidential information under applicable state law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted as diminishing or otherwise limiting the Companys right under applicable state law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prevent me from disclosing or otherwise utilizing any information (i) in any manner required by applicable law, judicial order or other governmental mandate or investigation provided I shall advise the Company of any such intended disposition or use and reasonably cooperate with the Company in allowing the Company to seek and obtain from the recipient governmental or judicial body any protective order or assurance of confidentiality regarding such information or (ii) in fulfillment of my duties or obligations owed to the Company.
 
   
Return of Materials

I further covenant and agree that I have or shall promptly deliver to the Company all memoranda, notes, records, manuals or other documents, including all copies of such materials and all documentation prepared or produced in connection therewith, containing Trade Secrets or Confidential Information regarding the Company's business, whether made or compiled by me or furnished to me by virtue of my employment with the Company.

I acknowledge that the restrictions, prohibitions and other provisions hereof, are reasonable, fair and equitable in scope, terms and duration, and are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company.
Subject to my being released from the prohibition against my undertaking of Conditional Activities and Conditional Solicitations upon my remittance of the Release Payment as contemplated hereunder, I acknowledge and agree that in the event I breach, or threaten in any way to breach, or it is inevitable that I will breach, any of the provisions of this Agreement, damages shall be an inadequate remedy and the Company shall be entitled, without bond, to injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to all other rights otherwise available to the Company at law or in equity.
Indemnification

Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any rights I may have under Article VII of the Companys by-laws in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
