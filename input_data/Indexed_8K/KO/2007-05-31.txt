Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
             
The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation ("TCCC"), Mustang Acquisition Company, LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCCC ("Merger Sub"), Energy Brands Inc. d/b/a Glaceau, a New York corporation ("Glaceau"), and J. Darius Bikoff ("Bikoff") and Michael Repole, each solely in his capacity as, respectively, Initial Stockholder Representative and Substitute Stockholder Representative (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of May 24, 2007, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the "Merger") with and into Glaceau with Glaceau surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of TCCC.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, TCCC will pay $4,230,000,000 in cash, less the sum of (x) Glaceau's share of unpaid transaction expenses and (y) the amount by which $130,000,000 exceeds the amount of cash held by Glaceau at the closing of the Merger, with respect to all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Glaceau and any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any securities of Glaceau.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976.  Glaceau has advised TCCC that it has obtained the requisite stockholder approval for the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
The Merger Agreement provides for the indemnification of TCCC with respect to certain matters.  Ten percent (10%) of the merger consideration will be held in escrow to satisfy indemnification claims.  Indemnification for claims shall be limited to the extent to which claims exceed $10,000,000, subject to certain exceptions.  In addition, Bikoff has entered into a Supplemental Indemnity Agreement (the "Supplemental Indemnity Agreement") whereby Bikoff has agreed personally to indemnify TCCC for damages in respect of certain representations contained in the Merger Agreement and in the event that it is determined that TCCC was defrauded in certain respects in connection with the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, in each case, to the extent such claims are not satisfied from the escrow fund.  With the exception of claims which may be made under the Supplemental Indemnity Agreement or claims for fraud, the funds held in escrow will be the exclusive source of recovery for TCCC with respect to any indemnification claim.  Indemnification of TCCC under the Merger Agreement shall expire eighteen months following the closing of the Merger, except for certain limited indemnification rights which expire two years following the closing of the Merger.  Indemnification of TCCC under the Supplemental Indemnity Agreement shall expire three years following the closing of the Merger.
TCCC has agreed, as set forth in a separate Roll-Over Agreement (the "Roll-Over Agreement"), to permit certain entities affiliated with The Tata Group ("Tata") to exchange their shares of Glaceau common stock for partnership interests in Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger, with the effect that, following the closing of the Merger, Tata will retain approximately 28.7% of the shares of common stock of the surviving company.  Pursuant to a Put and Call Option Agreement (the "Put/Call Agreement"), such shares will be subject to a call by TCCC, exercisable by TCCC at any time between October 22, 2007 and November 21, 2007, at a price equal to the per share merger consideration less any dividends paid thereon and an amount equal
2
to 10% of such consideration (which will be deposited in escrow to fund potential indemnity claims and additional transaction expenses).  Tata will also have the right under the Put/Call Agreement to put to TCCC, at any time between November 11, 2007 and December 3, 2007, the shares of the entity that will hold such shares of common stock of the surviving corporation at the same price.  TCCC currently intends to exercise the call.  Upon exercise of the call by TCCC or the put by Tata, TCCC would own 100% of the surviving corporation.  Pursuant to a separate Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement") between TCCC and Tata, Tata has agreed to vote its shares of common stock in the surviving company in accordance with TCCC's instructions and has granted an irrevocable proxy with respect to the voting of such shares to TCCC.
TCCC also entered into Investment Agreements, dated as of May 24, 2007, with each of J. Darius Bikoff, Michael Repole and Michael Venuti, the senior executives of Glaceau, pursuant to which they have agreed, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in their Investment Agreements, including the closing of the Merger and receipt of the Merger proceeds to be received by them, to purchase a number of shares of common stock of TCCC having an aggregate value equal to approximately $180 million based on the closing price of TCCC common stock on the trading day immediately prior to such purchase.
The foregoing description of the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Supplemental Indemnity Agreement, the Roll-Over Agreement, the Put/Call Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Investment Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, the Supplemental Indemnity Agreement, the Roll-Over Agreement, the Put/Call Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the form of Investment Agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 2.1 and 99.1 through 99.5 respectively.
The Merger Agreement, which is being filed to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contains various representations and warranties of Glaceau and TCCC.  The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a shareowner might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.  Accordingly, investors should not view the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and should not rely on them as such.  Investors should read the Merger Agreement together with the other information concerning TCCC contained in reports and statements that TCCC files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and those of the Merger Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agent may rely on the terms and conditions of this Agreement to govern and control in all respects.
(a)
          
The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct and, except with respect to claims based upon such gross negligence or willful misconduct that are asserted against the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnification Escrow Agent (and any successor to the Indemnification Escrow Agent) and each of the Indemnification Escrow Agent's officers, directors,

C-3
agents and employees from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, arising out of or in connection with its entering into this Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder.  The right to the indemnity afforded hereby shall survive the termination of this Agreement and any resignation or removal of the Indemnification Escrow Agent.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any of the Indemnification Escrow Funds held by it hereunder in good faith in accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of the Indemnification Escrow Funds, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Indemnification Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, without limitation, lost profits, even if the Indemnification Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.  The Indemnification Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of it duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult or retain counsel, accountants, or other skilled persons as selected by it.  The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons (not resulting from the Indemnification Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct). In the event that the Indemnification Escrow Agent is uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto, which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any such action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise jointly in writing by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Indemnification Escrow Agent, or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Indemnification Escrow Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such declaratory judgment.  The parties to this Agreement agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute without making the Indemnification Escrow Agent a party to the same, other than in connection with any dispute alleging that the Indemnification Escrow Agent breached its obligations under this Agreement.
The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the service thereof, unless the

Indemnification Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of any such lack of authenticity, correctness, proprietary or validity.  The Indemnification Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so unless the Indemnification Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of authority.  The Indemnification Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of any party hereto that is an entity has full power and authority to instruct the Indemnification Escrow Agent on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent or unless the Indemnification Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of power or authority.
The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the Indemnification Escrow Funds deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow holder only and having only possession thereof.

No such resignation or removal shall discharge any liability or obligations of the Indemnification Escrow Agent prior to the effective time of such resignation or removal.  If no successor escrow agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the termination or resignation of the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall first, place all of the Indemnification Escrow Funds at the disposal of a court and petition the court to act as the successor escrow agent or to appoint another entity to act as the successor escrow agent and second, if the court does not agree to act as successor agent or fails to appoint another entity to act as a successor escrow agent, deposit all of the Indemnification Escrow Funds into the registry of any court of competent jurisdiction and notify Parent and the Stockholder Representative in writing of such deposit.

Duties of Key Employee Escrow Agent
The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall be required to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other agreement, including the Merger Agreement.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of the Merger Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take any action pursuant to the terms thereof.  In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and those of the Merger Agreement, the Key Employee Escrow Agent may rely on the terms and conditions of this Agreement to govern and control in all respects.
(a)
          
The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct and, except with respect to claims based upon such gross negligence or willful misconduct that are asserted against the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Key Employee Escrow Agent (and any successor to the Key Employee Escrow Agent) and each of the Key Employee Escrow Agent's officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, arising out of or in connection with its entering into this Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder.  The right to the indemnity afforded hereby shall survive the termination of this Agreement and any resignation or removal of the Key Employee Escrow Agent.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any
(b)
          
D-3
of the Key Employee Escrow Funds held by it hereunder in good faith in accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of the Key Employee Escrow Funds, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Key Employee Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, without limitation, lost profits, even if the Key Employee Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of it duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult or retain counsel, accountants, or other skilled persons as selected by it.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons (not resulting from the Key Employee Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct). In the event that the Key Employee Escrow Agent is uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto, which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any such action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise jointly in writing by Parent and the Key Employee, which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such declaratory judgment.  The parties to this Agreement agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute without making the Key Employee Escrow Agent a party to the same, other than in connection with any dispute alleging that the Key Employee Escrow Agent breached its obligations under this Agreement.
The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the service thereof, unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of any such lack of authenticity, correctness, proprietary or validity.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of authority.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative
(c)
          
D-4
of any party hereto that is an entity has full power and authority to instruct the Key Employee Escrow Agent on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to the Key Employee Escrow Agent or unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of power or authority.
The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the Key Employee Escrow Funds deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow holder only and having only possession thereof.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall prepare and provide to the Key Employee and Parent a monthly information statement of the Key Employee Escrow Amount, including the Escrow Fund Earnings, no later than the last calendar day in respect of the immediately preceding full calendar month (the "").

Prior to the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the Key Employee and Parent shall jointly appoint a successor escrow agent, which shall be a bank or trust company having offices in New York, New York and assets in excess of $1,000,000,000, to hold the Key Employee Escrow Funds, and any such successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the predecessor escrow agent an instrument accepting such appointment, upon which such successor agent shall, without further act, become vested with all of the rights, powers and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named herein.  No such resignation or removal shall discharge any liability or obligations of the Key Employee Escrow Agent prior to the effective time of such resignation or removal.  If no successor escrow agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the termination or resignation of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall first, place all of the Key Employee Escrow Funds at the disposal of a court and petition the court to act as the successor escrow agent or to appoint another entity to act as the successor escrow agent and second, if the court does not agree to act as successor agent or fails to appoint another entity to act as a successor escrow agent, deposit all of the Key Employee Escrow Funds into the registry of any court of competent jurisdiction and notify Parent and the Key Employee in writing of such deposit.  In the event that the Key Employee Escrow Agent makes a deposit of the Key Employee Escrow Funds into the registry of a court in the manner specified in the preceding sentence, the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall thereupon be discharged from all further duties as the Key Employee Escrow Agent hereunder.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Key Employee Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe may be incurred by the Key Employee Escrow Agent in connection with the termination of the Escrow Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE
.  In the event that any payment is made out of the Indemnification Escrow Account under Section 8.10(b) of the Merger Agreement to any Parent Indemnified Party, Senior Executive shall be obligated to pay to Parent and Parent shall be
1.
           
Note Drawdowns
F-1
entitled to draw under the Note an amount equal to the amount of such payment under Section 8.10(b) multiplied by a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is         % [such Senior Executive's percentage ownership at closing on a fully diluted basis] and the denominator of which is the General Escrow Percentage (the "Applicable Percentage").  In the event Senior Executive fails to pay the amount of such draw within three Business Days of notice thereof, such failure shall be a default under this Agreement and Parent shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to pay over to Parent an amount of cash equal to the amount of such draw under the Note, and, if there is not then sufficient cash in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account to fund such payment, Parent shall instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent either (at Parent's option) to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares in such account to fund such payment or to deliver such number of shares, valued at Fair Market Value, to the Parent, , that if for any reason the Escrow and Collateral Agent is unable to promptly sell a sufficient number of Parent Shares in the open market upon receipt of an instruction from Parent to do so, it shall deliver to Parent a sufficient number of Parent Shares valued at Fair Market Value.  Any such payment to Parent shall be deemed a payment under, and shall reduce the outstanding Principal Amount of, the Note.  In the case of a delivery of the Pledged Shares to the Parent, the obligations on the Note shall be reduced in accordance with Section 9-608 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York; provided, however, that Parent waives any right to any claim for fees and expenses of collection or enforcement and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses, to which it might otherwise be entitled under the UCC.
provided
.  In the event that under Section 8.10(e) of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder Representative deducts from amounts received by it under Sections 8.10(c) or 8.10(d) of the Merger Agreement any amount to reimburse its expenses, Senior Executive shall, within three Business Days of notice of such payment, pay to the Stockholder Representative an amount equal to the amount of such payment multiplied by the Applicable Percentage.  In the event Senior Executive fails to make such payment at such time, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to, and shall instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to pay to the Stockholder Representative, an amount of cash equal to the amount of such required payment and, if there is not then sufficient cash in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account to fund such payment, to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares in such account to fund such payment.  Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested to release its lien in any such Parent Shares.

Other Payment Obligations
.  In the event that at any time (1) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, if any, on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account plus (y) two thirds of the Fair Market Value of the Parent Shares on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account is less than (2) the amount on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account multiplied by the Applicable Percentage, Senior Executive shall pay into the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account, within three Business Days of notice of such shortfall, an amount of cash equal to the amount of such shortfall.  In the event Senior Executive fails to make such payment at such time, Parent shall be entitled to, but shall not be obligated to, instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares, and hold in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account the proceeds of such sale, such that, following such action, the amount described in clause (1) of this paragraph is equal to the

(b)
         
In the event that at any time after the third anniversary of the Closing under the Merger Agreement (1) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, if any, on deposit in the  Stock Escrow and Collateral Account plus (y) two thirds of the Fair Market Value of the amount of Parent Shares on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account is greater than (2) the amount on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account multiplied by the Applicable Percentage, Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Senior Executive shall promptly instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount, comprised of cash and Parent Shares in such proportions as the Indemnified Party shall elect, such that, following such payment, the amount described in clause (1) above is equal to the amount described in clause (2) above, and Parent shall take such steps as may be necessary to release their security interests in such excess cash and/or Parent Shares.

Exhibit 99.6
 
 
 
 The Coca-Cola Company today announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Energy Brands, Inc., known as glacau, and its full range of fast-growing, enhanced water brands, including vitaminwater.  The acquisition, for $4.1 billion in cash, provides The Coca-Cola Company with a strong platform to grow its active lifestyle beverages.
ATLANTA and WHITESTONE, NY, May 25, 2007
The transaction is expected to be accretive to The Coca-Cola Company's earnings per share in the first full year following completion of the acquisition.  "We welcome vitaminwater, the icon of active lifestyles, to Coca-Cola, the ultimate and enduring icon of refreshment," said Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Company. "Glacau has built a great business with high-quality growth,
as well as a strong pipeline of innovative products and brands. We envision even faster growth for glacau as part of Coca-Cola's enhanced range of brands for North American customers and consumers.  We will manage this opportunity in a way that delivers attractive returns for our shareowners and also appropriately benefits our system," Mr. Isdell concluded.
"This is an outstanding opportunity for both of our companies to build an expanded active lifestyle business, first in the United States and then around the world," said Muhtar Kent, president and chief operating officer of The Coca-Cola Company.  "It sharpens even further our existing focus on re-establishing sustainable growth in our home market, strengthening our system, and leveraging acquisition opportunities to gain speed and capabilities in key categories.  We're committed to winning by reigniting growth in our core business of sparkling beverages while becoming the fastest-growing still beverage company in North America. I am confident we have the strategy, focus and leadership team in North America to deliver on that promise.
"Glacau and its brands also provide us with highly attractive longer-term international opportunities," Mr. Kent added.  "We look forward to discussing with glacau's distributors and our bottling partners the best operating model for glacau's routes-to-market."
Strategic Opportunity for Growth and Value Creation
The Company said that the acquisition of glacau will expand the Company's ability to meet consumers' needs further across the entire spectrum of sparkling and still beverages.  With its vitaminwater, smartwater, fruitwater and vitaminenergy brands, glacau is uniquely positioned in key market categories, with a leading position in enhanced water and attractive brands in water and energy drinks.  These categories are expected to make up a large portion of the beverage industry's volume and gross profit growth in North America through 2010.
"It's a perfect match connecting the hottest active lifestyle brand with the full resources of the world's best beverage company," said J. Darius Bikoff, glacau founder and chief executive officer.  "To best understand today's announcement, you really need to go out, buy a bottle of vitaminwater and try it for yourself to see how well it works."

Operational Structure Built for Success
Glacau will operate as a separate business unit within Coca-Cola North America (CCNA).  This structure will allow glacau to continue to win in the marketplace by maximizing its focus, speed, sales and execution capabilities, while leveraging the scale of CCNA's resources in supply chain, marketing and consumer insights, large customer management and foodservice.
The Company noted that glacau's top three executives (J. Darius Bikoff, Mike Repole, and Mike Venuti) intend to lead the business for a minimum of three years, and that other key managers will remain in the business.
"Glacau has a great and talented management team, whose brand building and creativity will complement and strengthen our business in North America," said Sandy Douglas, president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola North America. "Operating as a separate business unit within Coca-Cola North America, glacau will continue to focus its passion and marketing experience to create excitement with consumers and customers.
"As people head out this summer, whether they are running along the beach, hiking in the mountains, or relaxing poolside, this combination ensures we are always within an arm's reach of their desires," added Douglas."We are excited that The Coca-Cola Company sees the explosive potential in our brands, and recognizes our people are the driving force behind the success of glacau," said Mike Repole, president of glacau.
The transaction, which is expected to close in the summer of 2007, is subject to customary regulatory review. The boards of both companies have approved the transaction.
