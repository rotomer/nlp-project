ATLANTA, Apr. 16, 2008
 The Coca-Cola Company today reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.64, an increase of 19 percent versus the prior year on a reported basis, and $0.67 after considering items impacting comparability, an increase of 20 percent.  Earnings per share for the quarter included a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs.  Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 were $0.54, which included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily related to an asset write-off in the Philippines bottler, partially offset by gains on the sales of the equity interest in a Brazilian bottler and real estate in Spain.
 
"We have begun 2008 successfully, with another solid quarter consistent with our overriding objective of creating long-term sustainable growth," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Neville Isdell.  "Our system's success in executing our strategies  from marketing and beverage innovation to effective execution at the point of sale  continues to drive our growth.  Importantly, our growth was again balanced, proving our ability to manage our portfolio of brands and geographies over time to deliver results.  As Muhtar assumes executive leadership of our Company, I am confident that the strategies and programs that we together have put in place will continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value to our shareowners."
 
President and Chief Operating Officer Muhtar Kent said, "Our performance in the first quarter further builds on our success in 2007 in every respect.  Our international business once again led the way, with both sparkling and still beverages contributing to our results.  We do recognize there is still much more work to be done, especially in our flagship North America market with its challenging economic environment.
 
"I remain optimistic about the progress we are making and committed to continued improvement in the execution of our strategies.  Even in the face of a difficult macroeconomic climate, I believe that by continuing to collaborate with our bottling partners and maintaining an unrelenting focus on integrated consumer marketing and commercial and franchise leadership, we will achieve another successful year for The Coca-Cola Company."

In the quarter, South Africa's unit case volume declined 9 percent, cycling 29 percent growth in the prior year quarter, driven by
supply chain issues resulting from carbon dioxide shortages in the current quarter and the cycling of strong growth in the prior year quarter, primarily related to the replenishment of trade inventory levels due to carbon dioxide shortages in late 2006.

Unit case volume in the European Union Group increased 3 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 11 percent growth in the prior year quarter.  Net revenues for
 
the quarter increased 17 percent, reflecting a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales, positive pricing and mix and a low teens currency benefit.

The results for the quarter reflected continued balanced growth across the portfolio, achieving 2 percent unit case volume growth in sparkling beverages and double-digit growth in still beverages.  Unit case volume growth was also broad-based across the countries, with all key countries reflecting growth.  Great Britain unit case volume increased mid single digits, achieving its second consecutive quarter of growth.  Germany unit case volume increased 2 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 11 percent growth in the prior year quarter.

The Latin America Group continued to deliver strong unit case volume growth of 9 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 7 percent growth in the prior year quarter.

Unit case volume in the North America Group was even in the quarter, reflecting a difficult U.S. economic environment.  Retail unit case volume increased 2 percent, including a benefit from acquisitions, and Foodservice and Hospitality declined 4 percent, reflecting the challenging foodservice industry environment.  Net revenues for the quarter increased 13 percent, reflecting a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales, positive pricing, mix of finished goods businesses and an increase from acquisitions. Operating income decreased 7 percent reflecting the growth in net revenues, including the benefit of acquisitions, offset by higher input costs in the finished goods businesses, unfavorable mix and continued investment in key business initiatives.
 
                 
Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 3 percent in the quarter, primarily reflecting the decline in Foodservice and other on-premise businesses.  The continued successful execution of the three-cola strategy resulted in Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero each gaining share and contributed to core
 
sparkling category share gains in the U.S.  Coca-Cola Zero continued to deliver strong performance, increasing unit case volume more than 40 percent for the quarter, cycling strong double-digit growth in the prior year quarter.  The Company's portfolio of energy drinks also delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
 
                 
Still beverage unit case volume increased 10 percent in the quarter, reflecting the continued strong performance of glaceau and Fuze as well as mid single-digit growth in warehouse-delivered chilled juices.  Warehouse-delivered chilled juices gained category volume and value share in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in Trademark Simply and the expansion of Minute Maid Enhanced Juices.  Fuze and glaceau unit case volume continued to increase ahead of expectations, reflecting increased availability and velocity through the hybrid distribution model.
 
Pacific

Trademark Coca-Cola continued to deliver double-digit unit case volume growth driven by the success of Coca-Cola Zero and the execution of the three-cola strategy.  Georgia Coffee unit case volume increased 1 percent in the
quarter, achieving its second consecutive quarter of growth.  Mid single-digit unit case volume declines in Sokenbicha and Aquarius reflected unfavorable weather early in the quarter.
 
                 
In China, even with the disruption from the heavy snows during Chinese New Year, unit case volume increased 20 percent in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, Trademark Sprite and Minute Maid.  The strong performance across the brands resulted in share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.
 
                 
In the Philippines, unit case volume increased 21 percent in the quarter, cycling a 12 percent decline in the prior year quarter, with both sparkling and still beverages increasing unit case volume double digits.  Double-digit growth in Trademark Coca-Cola led to sparkling share gains.

Financial Review
 
Operating Results
 
Net operating revenues in the quarter increased 21 percent, driven by a 5 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 5 percent increase from structural changes primarily related to bottler acquisitions, a 9 percent currency benefit and a 2 percent favorable impact from pricing and mix.
 
Cost of goods sold increased 22 percent in the quarter, reflecting a 5 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 9 percent increase from currency and an 8 percent increase from structural changes primarily related to bottler acquisitions.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21 percent in the quarter, with structural changes primarily related to bottler acquisitions, increased costs from brand acquisitions and currency increasing selling, general and administrative expenses by 17 percent.  The Company continued to increase marketing expenses to support brand growth while effectively managing general and administrative expenses through productivity initiatives.
 
Operating income increased 15 percent for the quarter, reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by the investments in marketing and increased sales and service expenses in the bottling operations while effectively managing general and administrative expenses.  After considering items impacting comparability, operating income increased 19 percent in the quarter.  Currency benefited ongoing operating income by 11 percent in the quarter.  Based on current expectations of market rates for the remainder of the year and benefits of hedging coverage in place, the Company currently expects a favorable currency impact on 2008 operating income in the mid single-digit range.  Given the greater than expected currency benefit, the Company is evaluating whether there might be opportunities to reinvest a portion of the currency benefit in marketing programs and productivity initiatives to drive long-term sustainable growth.
 
The Company had other operating charges in the quarter of $78 million related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs.
 
Effective Tax Rate
 
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.0 percent and t
he underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 22.0 percent.  The variance between the reported rate and the underlying rate was primarily due to the tax impact of various separately disclosed items impacting comparability.
 
The
Company anticipates that its underlying effective tax rate on operations for the full year 2008 will be 22.0 percent.  The Company's estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
 
Items Impacting Prior Year Results
 
In 2007, the first quarter results included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily related to an asset write-off in the Philippines bottler, partially offset by gains on the sales of the equity interest in a Brazilian bottler and real estate in Spain.
 
Conference Call
 
The Company will host a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the first quarter results today at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  The Company invites investors to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call at the Company's website, www.thecoca-colacompany.com in the "Investors" section.  A replay in downloadable MP3 format will also be available within 24 hours after the audiocast on the Company's Web site.  Further, the "Investors" section of the Company's Web site includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used periodically by management when discussing the Company's financial results with investors and analysts to our results as reported under GAAP.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the Tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
