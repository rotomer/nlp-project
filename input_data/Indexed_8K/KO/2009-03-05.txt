If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules 
thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
 
(g)
                              
The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  The Company agrees that (1) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (2) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
(h)

The Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms;
 
(viii)
                       
The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;
 
(ix)
                             
The statements in the Preliminary Prospectus, as supplemented by any Free Writing Prospectuses, and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," other than "Book-Entry Delivery and Settlement," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Indenture
and the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
 
(x)
                                
The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940;
 
(xi)
                             
The Registration Statement became effective under the Act upon filing with the Commission, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, such counsel has been orally advised that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission;
 
(xii)
                          
The Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, as of their respective dates, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission (except as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement (the "Form T-1s"), as to which in each case such counsel need express no opinion); and
 
(xiii)
                       
Nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that has caused it to believe (a) that at the Effective Date, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) that the Disclosure Package, as of the time of pricing of the Securities, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) that the Final Prospectus, as of its date and on the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , that such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus and need not express any belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial information contained in or excluded from the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus.
provided, however
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that in clause (iv) and (vii) with respect to the validity and enforceability of the Indenture and the Securities, and in clause (v) and in clause (vi) with respect to any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency, body or court and the power and authority of the Company to authorize, issue and sell the Securities, such counsel has assumed that under the laws of any country in whose currency any Securities are denominated, if other than in U.S. dollars, that no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency, body or court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in any breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions in any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court.  Such counsel may note that (a) a New York statute provides that with respect to a foreign currency obligation a court of the State of New York shall render a judgment or decree in such foreign currency and such judgment or decree shall be converted into currency of the United States at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment and (b) with respect to a foreign currency obligation a United States court in New York may award judgment in United States dollars, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply.  Further, in rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the United States, or the Delaware General Corporation Law, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.  References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.  With regard to clauses (xii) and (xiii) above, such counsel may state that its statements therein are based upon their review and discussion of the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus but are without independent check or verification thereof, except as specified.
 
(c)
                               
The Representatives shall have received from Alston & Bird LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
(d)
                              
The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President
or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any supplement or amendments to the Final Prospectus, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
 
(i)
                                    
The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii)
                                 
No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
 
(iii)
                              
Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(e)
                               
At the Execution Time and the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
 
(i)
                                    
In their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules, if any, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
 
(ii)
                                 
On the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain procedures specified by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial information as described in AU Section 722, Interim Financial Statements (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareowners and the board of directors of the Company through a specified date no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter; and inquiries through a specified date no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
 
(1)
                                
the amounts included in the unaudited "Income Statement Information", if any, included in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and the amounts in the "Selected Financial Data" included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding amounts in the unaudited or audited financial statements from which such amounts were derived;
 
(2)
                                
any unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or, where applicable, Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; or
(3)
                                
with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at the date of the latest consolidated financial statements (if any) available prior to the date of the letter, in the capital stock of the Company (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of stock options, stock swaps and stock appreciation rights which were outstanding on the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus), increases in the long-term debt or decreases in the consolidated net current assets or the shareowners' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus to the date of the latest consolidated financial statements (if any) available prior to the date of the letter there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in net operating revenues or in the total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases that the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or as set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
 
(iii)
                              
On the basis of performing certain other procedures, as determined and specified by the Underwriters, relating to certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of and subject to the internal controls of the accounting systems of the Company and its subsidiaries) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus that such information agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
 
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
 
Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f)
                                   
 
Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation.
(g)
                                
 
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(h)
                                
 
The Representatives shall have received from counsel, satisfactory to the Representatives, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to compliance with the laws of any country, other than the United States, in whose currency Securities are denominated, the validity of the Securities, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(i)
                                    
 
If indicated in Schedule I hereto as being applicable to the offering of any Securities, the Representatives shall have received an opinion from tax counsel for the Company, satisfactory to the Representatives and dated the Closing Date, confirming their opinion as to United States tax matters set forth in the Final Prospectus.
(j)
                                    
 
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and its counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
.  If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
6.
                                      
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
.  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors and officers of each Underwriter, and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
7.
                                      
Indemnification and Contribution
 
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers,  and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company in Section 7(a) hereto, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities,
(b)
                                
(ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the three paragraphs related to over-allotments, syndicate covering transactions, stabilization transactions and penalty bids constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless
(c)
                                 
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigation or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to preceding sentence of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission
(d)
                                
to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
 
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  As used in this Section 8 only, the "aggregate amount" of Securities shall mean the aggregate principal amount of any Securities included in the relevant offering of Securities.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
8.
                                      
Default by an Underwriter
 
.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) there shall have been a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York state authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) there shall have been an outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or (v) there shall have occurred any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
9.
                                      
Termination
.  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
10.
                                
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
 
.  All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or sent by facsimile and confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or sent by facsimile and confirmed to it at One Coca-Cola Plaza, Atlanta, Georgia 30313, to the attention of the Treasurer, with a copy to the attention of the General Counsel of the Company at the same address.
11.
                                
Notices
 
.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
12.
                                
Successors
 
.  The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the  Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity.  Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters).  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of (U.S. $) on March 15, 2014 and to pay interest thereon from March 6, 2009, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing September 15, 2009 at the rate of 3.625% per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, rounded to the nearest cent), until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be September 1 or March 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest which is payable but is not so
                            
                        
punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this Series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
If either a date for payment of principal or interest on this Security or the Maturity of this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal or interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the payment was due.  No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the date for payment of principal of or interest on this Security or the Maturity of this Security provided such payment is made on such next succeeding Business Day.  For this purpose, "Business Day" means any day which is a day on which commercial banks settle payments and are open for general business in The City of New York.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check drawn upon any Paying Agent and mailed on or prior to an Interest Payment Date to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Securities Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by wire transfer to a Dollar account.

(Trustee's Certificate of Authentication)
 
This is one of the Securities of the Series provided for in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
[Reverse]
 
This Note (as defined herein) is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of April 26, 1988, as amended and supplemented by that First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1992, and by that Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2007 (as so amended and supplemented, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be denominated and bear interest, if any, in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.  This Security is one of a Series of Securities of the Company designated as set forth on the face hereof (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $900,000,000.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, redemption or transfer of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of The Depository Trust Company applicable to, and as in effect at the time of, such transaction.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of such principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes shall terminate. The Holders shall have such other rights and remedies after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default as set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected by such amendment or modification.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such Series, to waive compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.  Section 12.01(a) of the Indenture also contains provisions applicable to the Notes relating to the Company's ability to discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, upon the deposit of money, U.S. Government Obligations or other government obligations, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Notes to the Maturity of the Note, in certain specified circumstances.  The lien and sale and lease back provisions described in Sections 5.03 and 5.04 of the Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes.
 
Subject to the next preceding sentence hereof, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed, by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company may redeem the Notes at its option and at any time, either as a whole or in part.  If the Company elects to redeem the Notes, the Company will pay a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and
the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In determining the present value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, the Company will discount such payments to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points. A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of Notes of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes.
 
The term "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below). In determining this rate, the Company assumes a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such Redemption Date.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issue of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities." If such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, then Comparable Treasury Price would mean the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof to be redeemed and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.  The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription of the face of this Note, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of (U.S. $) on March 15, 2019 and to pay interest thereon from March 6, 2009, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing September 15, 2009 at the rate of 4.875% per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, rounded to the nearest cent), until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be March 1 or September 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest which is payable but is not so punctually paid or
                        
                
duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this Series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this Series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
If either a date for payment of principal or interest on this Security or the Maturity of this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal or interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the payment was due.  No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the date for payment of principal of or interest on this Security or the Maturity of this Security provided such payment is made on such next succeeding Business Day.  For this purpose, "Business Day" means any day which is a day on which commercial banks settle payments and are open for general business in The City of New York.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check drawn upon any Paying Agent and mailed on or prior to an Interest Payment Date to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Securities Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by wire transfer to a Dollar account.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof, directly or through an authenticating agent, by the manual signature of an authorized officer, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

This Note (as defined herein) is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of April 26, 1988, as amended and supplemented by that First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1992, and by that Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2007 (as so amended and supplemented, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be denominated and bear interest, if any, in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.  This Security is one of a Series of Securities of the Company designated as set forth on the face hereof (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,350,000,000.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, redemption or transfer of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of The Depository Trust Company applicable to, and as in effect at the time of, such transaction.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of such principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes shall terminate. The Holders shall have such other rights and remedies after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default as set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected by such amendment or modification.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such Series, to waive compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.  Section 12.01(a) of the Indenture also contains provisions applicable to the Notes relating to the Company's ability to discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, upon the deposit of money, U.S. Government Obligations or other government obligations, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Notes to the Maturity of the Note, in certain specified circumstances.  The lien and sale and lease back provisions described in Sections 5.03 and 5.04 of the Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes.
 
Subject to the next preceding sentence hereof, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed, by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company may redeem the Notes at its option and at any time, either as a whole or in part.  If the Company elects to redeem the Notes, the Company will pay a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and
the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In determining the present value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, the Company will discount such payments to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points. A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of Notes of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes.
 
The term "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below). In determining this rate, the Company assumes a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such Redemption Date.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issue of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities." If such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, then Comparable Treasury Price would mean the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof to be redeemed and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.  The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.
