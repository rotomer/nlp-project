On February 9, 2010, The Coca-Cola Company (the "Registrant") issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and furnished the press release on a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Initial Form 8-K"). Subsequently, the Registrant concluded that it had misclassified $2,130 million of bank time deposits with maturities in excess of three months but less than one year as cash and cash equivalents. This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A (this "Form 8-K/A") to the Initial Form 8-K is being furnished to revise the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Exhibit 99.1 to the Initial Form 8-K to reflect the appropriate classification of these bank time deposits.
 
The revised Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A reflect the following changes in the Current Assets section (i) a reduction of $2,130 million in the line item "Cash and cash equivalents" at December 31, 2009, (ii) the addition of the line item "Short-term investments" ($2,130 million at December 31, 2009 and zero at December 31, 2008), and (iii) the addition of the line item "Total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments" ($9,151 million at December 31, 2009 and $4,701 million at December 31, 2008).  The revised Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A reflect the following changes for the year ended December 31, 2009 (i) in the Investing Activities section, an increase of $2,130 million in the line item "Purchases of other investments" and a corresponding increase in the line item "Net cash used in investing activities" and (ii) in the Cash and Cash Equivalents section, a decrease of $2,130 million in the line item "Net increase during the year" and a corresponding decrease in the line item "Balance at end of year".
 
The revisions in this Form 8-K/A do not affect (i) the text of the press release or (ii) the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, the Operating Segments table or the Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures tables included in the press release. The Registrant will revise the press release posted on its website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com to reflect the appropriate classification of the bank time deposits.
