Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Business Separation and Merger Agreement
        As previously announced, on February 25, 2010, The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CCE"), International CCE, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE ("SplitCo"), and Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), entered into a Business Separation and Merger Agreement (the "Business Separation and Merger Agreement"). The Company owns approximately 34% of the outstanding common stock of CCE, and, during 2009, over 90% of CCE's sales volume represented products of the Company. In addition, one member of the CCE Board of Directors is a current executive officer of the Company, and another member of the CCE Board of Directors is a former executive officer of, and current consultant to, the Company.
        Pursuant to the Business Separation and Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof (the transactions contemplated by the Business Separation and Merger Agreement and certain related agreements described below are referred to as the "Merger Transactions"):
(i)
CCE will cause to be consummated a series of "separation transactions" as a result of which the businesses of CCE (other than CCE's business in the United States, Canada (other than CCE's Canadian finance company), the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, as well as a substantial majority of the corporate operating segment of CCE (collectively, the "North American Business")) will be transferred to SplitCo, a newly formed Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE; and
(ii)
Merger Sub will merge with and into CCE, with CCE surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which each outstanding share of CCE common stock (other than shares held by the Company and any dissenting stockholders) will be converted into the right to receive (A) one share of SplitCo common stock and (B) $10.00 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"). As a result of the transactions, from and after the effective time of the merger (the "Effective Time"), the Company will own 100% of the outstanding shares of CCE (which will hold the North American Business), and CCE's stockholders (other than the Company and any dissenting stockholders) will hold the outstanding shares of SplitCo (which will hold the businesses of CCE other than the North American Business).
        Pursuant to the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, CCE will have outstanding up to $8.88 billion of indebtedness (to the extent that CCE's debt as of the Effective Time is less than $8.88 billion, the Business Separation and Merger Agreement provides that, as agreed by the parties to reach the $8.88 billion, the Company will make a cash payment to CCE or certain additional borrowings may be incurred). The Business Separation and Merger Agreement also provides for adjustment payments between the parties based on Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital (as defined in the Business Separation and Merger Agreement) of the North American Business as of the Effective Time.
        The Business Separation and Merger Agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties, and consummation of the Merger Transactions is subject to certain conditions, including (i) approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least (A) 66/% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of CCE common stock and (B) a majority of all outstanding shares of CCE common stock (other than shares held by the Company or certain of the Company's or CCE's executive officers or directors); (ii) customary regulatory approvals (including in respect of competition laws); (iii) the absence of legal prohibitions or pending actions by governmental authorities that would prevent consummation of the Merger Transactions; (iv) receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS

3
in respect of certain tax aspects of the transaction in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the parties; (v) the absence of a North American Business Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Business Separation and Merger Agreement) and (vi) consummation of the Nordic Sale Transaction (as defined below). The Business Separation and Merger Agreement also includes customary covenants, as well as a non-compete covenant with respect to SplitCo and the right of SplitCo to acquire the Company's interest in the Company's German bottling operations for fair value between 18 to 36 months after the date of the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, on terms to be agreed by the parties.
        It is anticipated that SplitCo and CCE will fund the aggregate Cash Consideration in the Merger Transactions and the purchase price in the Nordic Sale Transaction using a combination of existing cash, certain payments to be made to CCE by the Company at the Effective Time, and debt financing obtained by SplitCo in either the public or private markets. Under the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, provided that CCE and SplitCo have used their best efforts to permit SplitCo to obtain the required financing, CCE and SplitCo are not obligated to close the Transactions (as defined below) if financing cannot be obtained because there has been a material adverse change or disruption in the financial, banking or capital markets generally which has rendered debt financing generally unavailable to companies similarly situated to SplitCo (provided that under these circumstances the Company has the right to provide the required financing on commercially reasonable terms).
        The Business Separation and Merger Agreement provides for certain indemnification rights of the parties in respect of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, in each case, subject to certain limitations, as well as indemnification rights in respect of certain specified liabilities.
        The Business Separation and Merger Agreement may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of the Company and CCE and, in certain cases, either the Company or CCE. In certain circumstances relating to termination, CCE may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $200 million, and, in certain other circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a fee to CCE based on CCE's reasonable transaction expenses (up to $100 million).
        Concurrently with the execution of the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, the parties entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement ("Tax Sharing Agreement") relating to certain tax matters and an Employee Matters Agreement in respect of certain employee matters ("Employee Matters Agreement"). The Business Separation and Merger Agreement also contemplates the execution of certain other related agreements at the Effective Time, including in respect of the use of the Coca-Cola name, transitional services and certain bottler's agreements.
Norway and Sweden Sale Transaction
        On February 25, 2010, the Company and CCE executed a letter (the "Letter Agreement") whereby the parties agreed in principle to the acquisition by a subsidiary of CCE (which will be a subsidiary of SplitCo after the Effective Time) of the Company's Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations (the "Nordic Sale Transaction" and, together with the Merger Transactions, the "Transactions") for $822 million. As a result of the proposed acquisition, from and after the effective time of the acquisition, SplitCo would hold the Company's Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. The Letter Agreement provides that the parties will work without delay to prepare and execute a definitive agreement (to be substantially modeled on the form of the Merger Agreement, to the extent applicable) providing for the Nordic Sale Transaction. The agreement in principle remains subject to execution of definitive agreements, and any such transaction would be subject to, among other things, customary regulatory approvals and consummation of the Merger Transactions under the Business Separation and Merger Agreement.
        The foregoing description of the Transactions, the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Letter Agreement and the other
agreements referred to herein are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Business Separation and Merger Agreement (and the exhibits thereto), Tax Sharing Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Letter Agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 attached hereto, respectively.
        The agreements attached hereto (including any exhibits to such agreements), which are being filed to provide investors with information regarding their terms, contain various representations, warranties and covenants of CCE and the Company. They are not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of each of the agreements, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto, and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of each of the agreements (including qualification by disclosures that are not necessarily reflected in the agreements). In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a stockholder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the agreements and should not view the representations, warranties or covenants in the agreements (or any description thereof) as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreements and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreements together with the other information concerning the Company contained in reports and statements that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CCE's management has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of CCE's internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

(1)
The Service Schedules attached hereto as of the date of the Merger Agreement are provided as a reference to illustrate the type of schedules that the parties anticipate finalizing and shall not be binding on either party. The parties will negotiate in good faith prior to the Effective Time and agree on and memorialize the final binding version of the Service Schedules.

If Services are being provided by third party service providers pursuant to an agreement between the Corporate Segment or the North American Business (as applicable) and such third party service provider, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such third party service provider provides the applicable Services in accordance with the terms of such agreement. In addition, the parties will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, amend any such agreement with a third party service provider in a manner that would reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the manner in which the Services are provided without first discussing such amendment with the other party in good faith.

TCCC and Splitco shall cooperate to facilitate obtaining any licenses and similar rights to allow Splitco to continue to participate in TCCC system wide master services agreements for information technology hardware and software systems and user applications and other information technology programs in substantially the same manner as had been conducted in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time.

3 - Charges

Splitco will pay TCCC the Service Charges (as defined below) on a calendar monthly basis in arrears, within 30 days of receiving TCCC's written monthly invoice to Splitco, unless Splitco in good faith disputes the amount of Service Charges contained in any such invoice within fifteen (15) days following Splitco's receipt of such invoice. TCCC's written monthly invoices shall set forth the Service Charges (itemized by Service and providing reasonable detail as to the extent of Services provided) and any applicable taxes payable by Splitco for such calendar month.

4 - Term and Termination

The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the separation and termination of Services as soon as is reasonably feasible, both for individual Services and overall.

The final agreed budget and assumptions shall be incorporated into the Service Schedules that are binding and effective as of the Effective Time. In the event that the term of the TSA is extended pursuant to Section 4(b), the parties will jointly develop and agree on a revised budget (reflecting the cost of providing the Services plus a markup of 5% other than on the third party pass through charges) and set of assumptions that will govern during any such extension period.
5 - Confidentiality
a)
Each party agrees to maintain on a confidential basis the other party's confidential information. The obligations in this Section 5 shall survive termination of this TSA or any Services provided hereunder.

CCE shareowners to exchange each CCE share for a share in a new CCE, focused solely on Europe, and $10 per share in cash at closing.
        ATLANTA, Feb.25, 2010
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: CCE) announce that they have entered into agreements that will strategically advance the Coca-Cola system in North America and drive long-term value for all shareholders. In addition, the parties have an agreement in principle to expand CCE's European business.
        "Our 2020 Vision calls for decisive and timely action to continuously improve and evolve our global franchise system to best serve our customers and consumers everywhere. Consistent with the 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together, we act today as an aligned system," said The Coca-Cola Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. "We are not acquiring CCE, rather we are acquiring their North American operations, and they remain one of our key bottling partners with world-class management, financial and operational capabilities. We have a strong and unrelenting belief in our unique and thriving global bottling system. Our new North American structure will create an unparalleled combination of businesses, which will serve as our passport to winning in the world's largest nonalcoholic ready-to-drink profit pool. This transaction offers compelling value to both The Coca-Cola Company and CCE shareowners and will create substantial and sustainable benefits for both companies' stakeholders."
        Mr. Kent continued, "Our North American business structure has remained essentially the same since CCE was founded in 1986, while the market and industry have changed dramatically. With this transaction, we are converting passive capital into active capital, giving us direct control over our investment in North America to accelerate growth and drive long-term profitability. We will work closely with our bottling partners to create an evolved franchise system for the unique needs of the North American market. Additionally, we will reconfigure our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Importantly, the creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute North America's brands. At the same time, in Europe, we are further strengthening our franchise system to provide broader, contiguous geographic coverage and optimizing our marketing and distribution leadership."
        CCE's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Brock said, "This transformation creates significant near-term shareowner value through the sale of the North American business for fair value, delivering over $4 billion in cash to CCE shareowners, through cash distributions and planned share repurchases. At the same time, this enables our shareowners to retain equity in a sales and distribution company with an improved growth profile. In the future, CCE shareowners will also benefit from the expansion of our European business and our improved financial flexibility."
        Mr. Brock added, "CCE remains the preeminent Western European bottler and a key strategic partner with The Coca-Cola Company. Our European business serves an attractive market with growing volumes and profit driven by rising per capita consumption. As such, CCE will have an improved profile with enhanced revenue, margins and EPS growth prospects. Together with The Coca-Cola Company, we will continue to improve the effectiveness of our operations in our expanded presence in Europe. These actions strengthen our ability to compete effectively and sustainably in Europe and represent the beginning of an exciting new era of long-term growth for CCE's business and shareowners."
        Mr. Kent concluded, "This is a truly historic day for the Coca-Cola system. As the world's leading beverage Company, we are very excited about the vast opportunities before us and I can say with confidence there is no better business to be in. Over the next several years, the nearly $650 billion dollar global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry is expected to grow faster than worldwide GDP and we are best positioned to capitalize on this enormous industry opportunity in North America and Europe. These joint actions further reinforce our confidence in achieving our 2020 Vision to more than double system revenue and double servings to over 3 billion per day. With our system more aligned than ever, the timing is right, and we believe that these actions will usher in a new era of winning for our Coca-Cola system."
Details of the Transactions
        The Coca-Cola Company, in a substantially cashless transaction, will acquire CCE's entire North American business, which consists of approximately 75 percent of U.S. bottler-delivered volume and almost 100 percent of Canadian bottler-delivered volume. At the close of the transaction, The Coca-Cola Company will have direct control over approximately 90 percent of the total North America volume, including its current direct businesses. The Coca-Cola Company's acquisition of the assets and liabilities of CCE's North American Business includes consideration of The Coca-Cola Company's current 34 percent equity ownership in CCE, valued at $3.4 billion, based upon a thirty day trailing average as of February 24, 2010. In addition, consideration includes the assumption of $8.88 billion of CCE debt and all of the North American assets and liabilitiesincluding CCE's accumulated benefits obligation for North America of $580 million as of December 31, 2009, and certain other one-time costs and benefits.
        In a concurrent agreement, The Coca-Cola Company and CCE have agreed in principle that CCE will buy The Coca-Cola Company's bottling operations in Norway and Sweden for $822 million, subject to the signing of definitive agreements, and that CCE will have the right to acquire The Coca-Cola Company's 83 percent equity stake in its German bottling operations 18 to 36 months after closing for fair value.
        A new entity, which will retain the name Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., will be created through a split-off that will hold CCE's European businesses. CCE's public shareowners will exchange each existing CCE share for a share in the new entity and will hold 100 percent of this new entity.
        CCE will provide its shareowners, excluding The Coca-Cola Company, with a special one-time cash payment of $10 per share. In connection with the transactions, CCE expects to raise initial debt financing of up to 3.0x EBITDA to pay shareowners $10 per share in cash at closing, to acquire the Norway and Sweden bottlers and to fund the expected share repurchase program. Following completion of the transaction, it is expected that CCE will adopt a program to repurchase up to approximately $1 billion of shares and a policy of paying an expected annual dividend of $0.50 per share subject to the discretion of CCE's Board of Directors and its consideration of various factors.
        The Coca-Cola Company and CCE expect the transactions to close in the fourth quarter of 2010.
About CCR-USA and CCRC
        At the close, The Coca-Cola Company will rename the sales and operational elements of the North American businesses Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ("CCR-USA") and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. ("CCRC"), which will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company. Following the close, The Coca-Cola Company will combine the Foodservice business, The Minute Maid Company, the Supply Chain organization, including finished product operations, and our company-owned bottling operations in Philadelphia with CCE's North American business to form CCR-USA and CCRC. In the U.S., CCR-USA will be organized as a unified operating entity with distinct capabilities to include supply chain and logistics, sales and customer service operations. In Canada, CCRC will be a single dedicated production, marketing, sales and distribution organization. The Coca-Cola Company's remaining North American operation will continue to be responsible for brand marketing and franchise support. Details regarding the structure, leadership and integration plans will be forthcoming.
        Once completed, the transactions are expected to generate operational synergies of approximately $350 million over four years for The Coca-Cola Company and are expected to be accretive to EPS on a fully diluted basis by 2012. Further, in North America, this will generate system synergies that will increase the growth rate and cash flow on a pro forma basis over time. Pro forma for this acquisition,
the North American business, including CCR-USA and CCRC, would have generated approximately $19.2 billion in revenues and $3.6 billion of EBITDA in 2009.
The Coca-Cola Company 2010 Outlook
        As a result of these agreements, The Coca-Cola Company has not made any share repurchases during the current fiscal year and will continue to be out of the market until the close of these transactions. However, the Company remains committed to repurchasing $1.5 billion in 2010.
About new CCE
        CCE will be The Coca-Cola Company's strategic bottling partner in Western Europe and the third-largest independent bottler globally. Reflecting CCE's position as The Coca-Cola Company's strategic bottling partner in Western Europe, the companies will enter into a 10+10 year bottling agreement and a 5-year incidence pricing agreement. Pro forma, including the contributions of Norway and Sweden, CCE would have generated approximately $7.3 billion in revenues, $850 million in operating income, and $1.2 billion of EBITDA in 2009.
        At closing, before planned share repurchases, CCE expects to have net debt of approximately $2 billion. Immediately after closing and before share repurchase, CCE is expected to have approximately 350-360 million outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, substantially comparable to the publicly owned shares of CCE today.
        Shortly after closing, the Board of CCE is expected to announce a planned share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion and an initial annual dividend of $0.50 per share. Payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases by CCE will be at the discretion of CCE's Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, CCE's financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for growth. Therefore, no assurance can be given that CCE will pay any dividends to its shareowners or make share repurchases, and no assurance can be given to the amount of any such dividends or share repurchases if CCE's Board of Directors determines to do so.
        CCE will retain the Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. corporate name and remain headquartered in Atlanta. CCE will continue to be traded on the NYSE under the CCE ticker. John Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Douglas, Chief Financial Officer, Hubert Patricot, President of the European Group, and other members of the CCE corporate management team will continue to lead the company. In addition, the current independent directors will continue to comprise the CCE Board.
CCE 2010 Outlook
        As a result of these agreements, CCE has not made any share repurchases during the current fiscal year, and it does not plan to do so before the transactions close. CCE intends to provide additional details on FY 2010 outlook during its upcoming first quarter call.
