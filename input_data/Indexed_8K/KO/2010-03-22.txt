As

The Coca-Cola Company,
a
Delaware
corporation
(the "Company"),
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CCE"), International CCE, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE ("SplitCo"), and Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Business Separation and Merger Agreement (the "Business Separation and Merger Agreement" and the transactions contemplated by the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, the "Merger Transactions").  Also as previously disclosed, in connection with the execution of the Business Separation and Merger Agreement, on February 25, 2010, the Company and CCE executed a letter (the "Letter Agreement") whereby the parties agreed in principle to the acquisition by a subsidiary of CCE of the Company's Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations.
 
As contemplated by the Letter Agreement, on March 20, 2010, the Company, Bottling Holdings (Luxembourg) s.a.r.l., a Luxembourg socit  responsabilit limite and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE ("Buyer"), CCE and SplitCo entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Nordic SPA").  Pursuant to the Nordic SPA and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Buyer (a subsidiary of CCE which will be a subsidiary of SplitCo as of the closing of the Merger Transactions) will acquire 100% of the outstanding equity securities of Coca-Cola Drikker AS and Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB for $822 million (the transactions contemplated by the Nordic SPA and certain related agreements described below are referred to as the "Nordic Transactions"). The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on (i) Closing Net Working Capital (as defined in the Nordic SPA) of the Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations as of the closing and (ii) the EBITDA (as defined in the Nordic SPA) of the Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
 
The Nordic SPA includes certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, and consummation of the Nordic Transactions is subject to certain conditions, including (i) customary regulatory approvals (including in respect of competition laws); (ii) the absence of legal prohibitions or pending actions by governmental authorities that would prevent consummation of the Nordic Transactions; (iii) the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Nordic SPA) on the Nordic business; and (iv) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Business Separation and Merger Agreement.
 
The Nordic SPA provides for certain indemnification rights of the parties in respect of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, in each case, subject to certain limitations. The Nordic SPA may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and the Company and, in certain cases, either Buyer or the Company.  The Nordic SPA also contemplates the execution of certain related agreements at the closing in respect of the use of the Coca-Cola name and certain bottler's agreements.
 
The Company owns approximately 34% of the outstanding common stock of CCE, and, during 2009, over 90% of CCE's sales volume represented products of the Company. In addition, one member of the CCE Board of Directors is a current executive officer of the Company, and another member of the CCE Board of Directors is a former executive officer of, and current consultant to, the Company.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Nordic Transactions, the Nordic SPA and the other agreements referred to herein are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Nordic SPA (and the exhibits thereto), a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 attached hereto.
 
The agreement attached hereto (including the exhibits to such agreement), which is being filed to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contain various representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the other parties thereto. They are not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto or any subsidiaries of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of each of the agreements, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto, and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of each of the agreements (including qualification by disclosures that are not necessarily reflected in the agreements). In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a stockholder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the agreements and should not view the representations, warranties or covenants in the agreements (or any description thereof) as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreements (or their subsidiaries) and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreements together with the other information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries contained in reports and statements that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(d)
                               
The Company reserves the right, to the extent permitted by the law applicable in the Territory, to establish and to revise, by giving written notice to the Bottler, maximum prices at which the Beverage in Approved Containers may be sold by the Bottler to wholesalers and retailers and the maximum retail prices for the Beverage. It is recognized in this regard that the Bottler may sell the Beverage to wholesalers and retailers and authorize the retail sale of the Beverage at prices which are lower than the maximum prices. The Bottler shall not, however, increase the maximum prices established or revised by the Company at which the Beverage in Approved Containers may be sold to wholesalers and retailers nor authorize an increase in the maximum prices for the Beverage without the prior written consent of the Company.
 
(e)
                               
The Bottler undertakes to collect from or charge to retail or wholesale outlets, as applicable, for each refillable Approved Container and each
 
returnable case delivered to retail or wholesale outlets, such deposits as the Company may determine from time to time by giving written notice to the Bottler, and to make all reasonably diligent efforts to recover all empty refillable Approved Containers and cases and, upon recovery, to refund or to credit the deposits for said refillable Approved Containers and returnable cases returned undamaged and in good condition.

.   OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE BOTTLER
 
27.
          
It is recognized and acknowledged among the parties hereto that the Company has a vested and legitimate interest in maintaining, promoting and safeguarding the overall performance, efficiency and integrity of the Company's international bottling, distribution and sales system.  It is further recognized and acknowledged among the parties hereto that this Agreement has been entered into by the Company intuitu personae and in reliance upon the identity, character and integrity of the owners, controlling parties and managers of the Bottler, and the Bottler warrants having made to the Company prior to the execution hereof a full and complete disclosure of the owners and of any third parties having a right to, or power of, control or management of the Bottler.  It is therefore agreed among the parties hereto that notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 16 or any other provision of this Clause 27, in the event of any change, due to any cause, of the real persons or legal entities having direct or indirect ownership or control of the Bottler, including any changes of the share-owner composition of such entities, the Company, in its sole discretion, may terminate this Agreement forthwith and without liability for damages.  The Bottler, therefore, covenants and agrees:
 
(a)
          
not to assign, transfer, pledge or in any way encumber this Agreement or any interest herein or rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party or parties without the prior written consent of the Company;
 
(b)
         
not to delegate performance of this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party or parties without the prior written consent of the Company;
 
(c)
          
to notify the Company promptly in the event of or upon obtaining knowledge of any third party action which may or will result in any change in the ownership or control of the Bottler;
 
(d)
         
to make available from time to time and at the request of the Company complete records of current ownership of the Bottler and full information concerning any third party or parties by whom it is controlled, directly or indirectly;
 
(e)
          
to the extent the Bottler has any legal control over changes in the ownership or control of the Bottler, not to initiate or implement, consent to or acquiesce in any such change without the prior written consent of the Company; and
 
(f)
          
if the Bottler is organized as a partnership, not to change the composition of such partnership by the inclusion of any new partners or the release of existing partners without the prior written consent of the Company.
 
In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Clause 27, if a proposed change in ownership or control of the Bottler involves a direct or indirect transfer to or acquisition of ownership or control of the Bottler, in whole or in part, by a person or entity authorized by the Company to manufacture, sell, distribute or otherwise deal in any beverage products and/or any Trade Marks of the Company (the "Acquiror Bottler"), the Company may request any and all information it considers relevant from both the Bottler and the Acquiror Bottler in order to make its
 
determination as to whether to consent to such change. In any such circumstances, the parties hereto, recognizing and acknowledging the vested and legitimate interest of the Company in maintaining, promoting and safeguarding the overall performance, efficiency and integrity of the Company's international bottling, distribution and sales system, expressly agree that the Company may consider all and any factors, and apply any criteria that it considers relevant in making such determination.
 
It is further recognized and agreed among the parties hereto that the Company, in its sole discretion, may withhold consent to any proposed change in ownership or other transaction contemplated in this Clause 27, or may consent subject to such conditions as the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine.  The parties hereto expressly stipulate and agree that any violation by the Bottler of the foregoing covenants contained in this Clause 27 shall entitle the Company to terminate this Agreement forthwith
without liability for damages
; and, furthermore, in view of the personal nature of this Agreement, that the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
without liability for damages
if any other third party or parties should obtain any direct or indirect interest in the ownership or control of the Bottler, even when the Bottler had no means to prevent such a change, if, in the opinion of the Company, such change either enables such third party or parties to exercise a decisive influence over the management of the Bottler or materially alters the ability of the Bottler to comply fully with the terms, obligations and conditions of this Agreement.
 
28.
        
The Bottler shall, prior to the issue, offer, sale, transfer, trade or exchange of any of its shares of stock or other evidence of ownership, its bonds, debentures or other evidence of indebtedness, or the promotion of the sale of the above, or stimulation or solicitation of the purchase or an offer to sell thereof, obtain the written consent of the Company whenever the Bottler uses in this connection the name of the Company or the Trade Marks or any description of the business relationship with the Company in any prospectus, advertisement or other sales efforts.  The Bottler shall not use the name of the Company or the Trade Marks or any description of the business relationship with the Company in any prospectus or advertisement used in connection with the Bottler's acquisition of any shares or other evidence of ownership in a third party without the Company's prior written consent.

In addition, the Company, in its sole discretion, may through written notice to the Bottler appoint a third party as its representative to ensure that the Bottler carries out its obligations under this Agreement, with full powers to oversee the Bottler's performance and to require from the Bottler its compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The Bottler agrees to inform the Company:
 
(1)

In order to address such incidents, including but not limited to any questions of quality of the Beverage that may occur, the Bottler will designate and organize an incident management team and inform the Company of the members of such team.
