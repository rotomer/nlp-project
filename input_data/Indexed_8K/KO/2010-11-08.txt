(c)
          
If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will (1) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (2) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (3) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
 
(g)
          
The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show.

The Company agrees that (1) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (2) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that in clause (iv) and (vii) with respect to the validity and enforceability of the Indenture and the Securities, and in clause (v) and in clause (vi) with respect to any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency, body or court and the power and authority of the Company to authorize, issue and sell the Securities, such counsel has assumed that under the laws of any country in whose currency any Securities are denominated, if other than in U.S. dollars, that no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency, body or court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in any breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions in any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court.  Such counsel may note that (a) a New York statute provides that with respect to a foreign currency obligation a court of the State of New York shall render a judgment or decree in such foreign currency and such judgment or decree shall be converted into currency of the United States at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment and (b) with respect to a foreign currency obligation a United States court in New York may award judgment in United States dollars, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply.  Further, in rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the United States, or the Delaware General Corporation Law, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.  References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.  With regard to clauses (xii) and (xiii) above, such counsel may state that its statements therein are based upon their review and discussion of the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus but are without independent check or verification thereof, except as specified.
 
(c)
          
The Representatives shall have received from Alston & Bird LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such
documents as they may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
(d)
          
The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any supplement or amendments to the Final Prospectus, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
 
(i)
           
The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii)
          
No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
 
(iii)
         
Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(e)
          
At the Execution Time and the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
 
(i)
           
In their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules, if any, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
 
(ii)
          
On the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial information as described in AU Section 722, Interim Financial Statements (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareowners and the board of directors of the Company through a specified date no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter; and inquiries through a specified date no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements in or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
 
(1)
          
the amounts included in the unaudited "Income Statement Information", if any, included in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and the amounts in the "Selected Financial Data" included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding amounts in the unaudited or audited financial statements from which such amounts were derived;
 
(2)
          
any unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or, where applicable, Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are not in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; or
 
(3)
          
with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at the date of the latest consolidated financial statements (if any) available prior to the date of the letter, in the capital stock of the Company (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of stock options, stock swaps and stock appreciation rights which were outstanding on the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus), increases in the long-term debt or decreases in the consolidated net current assets or the shareowners' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus to the date of the latest consolidated financial statements (if any) available prior to the date of the letter there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in net operating revenues or in the total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases that the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or as set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
 
(iii)
         
On the basis of performing certain other procedures, as determined and specified by the Underwriters, relating to certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of and subject to the internal controls of the accounting systems of the Company and its subsidiaries) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus that such information agrees with the
accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
 
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
 
(f)
           
Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(g)
          
Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
(h)
          
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
(i)
           
The Representatives shall have received from counsel, satisfactory to the Representatives, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to compliance with the laws of any country, other than the United States, in whose currency Securities are denominated, the validity of the Securities, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
(j)
           
If indicated in Schedule I hereto as being applicable to the offering of any Securities, the Representatives shall have received an opinion from tax counsel for the Company, satisfactory to the Representatives and dated the Closing Date, confirming their opinion as to United States tax matters set forth in the Final Prospectus.
 
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and its counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be
cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
 
6.
            
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
.  If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
 
7.
            
Indemnification and Contribution
.  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors and officers of each Underwriter, and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers,  and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company in Section 7(a) hereto, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity
agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the five paragraphs related to over-allotments, syndicate covering transactions, stabilization transactions and penalty bids constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d)
          
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigation or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to preceding sentence of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
 
8.
            
Default by an Underwriter
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  As used in this Section 8 only, the "aggregate amount" of Securities shall mean the aggregate principal amount of any Securities included in the relevant offering of Securities.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
 
9.
            
Termination
.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) there shall have been a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) there shall have been a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York state authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) there shall have been an outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or (v) there shall have occurred any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with
the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
 
10.
          
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
.  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Successors

13.
          
No Fiduciary Duty
.  The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity.  Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters).  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
14.
          
Integration
.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
