If any Interest Payment Date, Interest Reset Date or a date for payment or the Maturity for this Security would otherwise be a day that is not a LIBOR Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or Interest Reset Date shall be the next succeeding LIBOR Business Day, unless the next succeeding LIBOR Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case such Interest Payment Date or Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding LIBOR Business Day.

preceding the first day of the relevant Interest Period.
 
"Interest Period" means the period commencing on any Interest Payment Date for this Security (or, with respect to the initial Interest Period only, commencing on November 15, 2010) to, but excluding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date for this Security, and in the case of the last such period, from and including the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the maturity date to but not including such maturity date.

The amount of interest to be paid on this Security for any interest period will be calculated by adding the daily interest amounts for each day in such interest period.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

This is one of the Securities of the Series provided for in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
This Note (as defined herein) is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of April 26, 1988, as amended and supplemented by that First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1992, and by that Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2007 (as so amended and supplemented, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be denominated and bear interest, if any, in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Security is one of a Series of Securities of the Company designated as set forth on the face hereof (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,250,000,000.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, redemption or transfer of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of The Depository Trust Company applicable to, and as in effect at the time of, such transaction.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of such principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes shall terminate. The Holders shall have such other rights and remedies after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default as set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected by such amendment or modification.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

Section 12.01(a) of the Indenture also contains provisions applicable to the Notes relating to the Company's ability to discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, upon the deposit of money, U.S. Government Obligations or other government obligations, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Notes to the Maturity of the Note, in certain specified circumstances. The lien and sale and lease back provisions described in Sections 5.03 and 5.04 of the Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes.
 
Subject to the next preceding sentence hereof, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed, by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company may redeem the Notes at its option and at any time, either as a whole or in part. If the Company elects to redeem the Notes, the Company will pay a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and
 
the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In determining the present value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, the Company will discount such payments to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points. A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of Notes of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes.
 
The term "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below). In determining this rate, the Company assumes a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such Redemption Date.

This is one of the Securities of the Series provided for in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
This Note (as defined herein) is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of April 26, 1988, as amended and supplemented by that First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1992, and by that Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2007 (as so amended and supplemented, herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company (now known as Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The Securities may be issued in one or more Series, which different Series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be denominated and bear interest, if any, in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any), may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Security is one of a Series of Securities of the Company designated as set forth on the face hereof (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000.
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, redemption or transfer of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of The Depository Trust Company applicable to, and as in effect at the time of, such transaction.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of such principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes shall terminate. The Holders shall have such other rights and remedies after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default as set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time
 
outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such Series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture. Section 12.01(a) of the Indenture also contains provisions applicable to the Notes relating to the Company's ability to discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, upon the deposit of money, U.S. Government Obligations or other government obligations, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal of and interest on the Notes to the Maturity of the Note, in certain specified circumstances. The lien and sale and lease back provisions described in Sections 5.03 and 5.04 of the Indenture will not be applicable to the Notes.
 
Subject to the next preceding sentence hereof, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed, by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company may redeem the Notes at its option and at any time, either as a whole or in part. If the Company elects to redeem the Notes, the Company will pay a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and
 
the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In determining the present value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, the Company will discount such payments to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points. A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of Notes of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Notes.
 
The term "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below).

"Independent Investment Banker" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities." If such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, then Comparable Treasury Price would mean the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.

Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

The term "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below). In determining this rate, the Company assumes a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such Redemption Date.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issue of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities." If such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, then Comparable Treasury Price would mean the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
The term "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof to be redeemed and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription of the face of this Note, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:
 
 
Additional abbreviations may also be used though not in the above list.
 
For value received                                       hereby sell(s), assign(s) and transfer(s) unto                                       (Please insert social security or other identifying number of assignee) the within Note, and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints                                        as attorney to transfer the said Note on the books of the Company, with full power of substitution in the premises.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
CORRECTIVE PRESS RELEASE
 
 
 
ATLANTA, Nov. 16, 2010
 The Coca-Cola Company ("TCCC" or the "Company") today announced changes to the terms of its previously announced Any and All Offer and Maximum Tender Offer for certain series of outstanding debt securities issued by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ("CCR"), pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated November 4, 2010, which sets forth a more comprehensive description of the terms of the tender offers.  The purpose of this press release is to correct the pricing terms of the 6.750% Debentures due September 15, 2028 that were announced in a press release issued by the Company earlier today.
 
The Company announced today that it was increasing the consideration offered for the outstanding 7.125% Debentures due August 1, 2017, 8.500% Debentures due February 1, 2022, 8.000% Debentures due September 15, 2022, 6.750% Debentures due September 15, 2023, 7.000% Debentures due October 1, 2026, 6.950% Debentures due November 15, 2026 and 6.750% Debentures due September 15, 2028 issued by CCR pursuant to the Any and All Offer and the Company's outstanding 5.350% Debentures due November 15, 2017 pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer.  The remaining series of notes that the Company has offered to purchase pursuant to the Any and All Offer and Maximum Tender Offer will continue to be subject to the same consideration.
 
The table below indicates the revised pricing terms for each series of notes that is subject to an increase in consideration offered.
 
 
(1) Per $1,000 principal amount of notes accepted for purchase.
 
The Company also announced today that it is extending the expiration date of the tender offers.  The Any and All Offer will now expire at 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 22, 2010.  The Any and All Offer Withdrawal Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) has passed and notes validly tendered through 5:00 p.m., EST, yesterday, the original expiration date for the Any and All Offer, may not be withdrawn except under the circumstances described in the Offer to Purchase.
 
The Maximum Tender Offer will now expire at 11:59 p.m., EST, on December 14, 2010.  Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer must tender and not withdraw their notes before the early tender date, which is now 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010 to be eligible to receive the total consideration.  Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date will be eligible to receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total consideration minus $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holder that are accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date may not withdraw their notes except in the limited circumstances described fully in the Offer to Purchase.
 
The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offers will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to a fixed spread specified for each series of the notes over the yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security specified on the cover page of the Offer to Purchase, as calculated by the
dealer managers at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 22, 2010 for the Any and All Offer and at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010 for the Maximum Tender Offer.  In addition to the total consideration or the tender offer consideration, as applicable, accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered notes accepted in the tender offers. The settlement dates for the Any and All Offer and the Maximum Tender Offer will follow promptly after the applicable extended expiration dates and currently are expected to be Tuesday, November 23, 2010 and Wednesday, December 15, 2010, respectively.
 
The Any and All Offer and the Maximum Tender Offer are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, among other things, the consummation of the Company's issuance of one or more new series of senior notes with net proceeds of at least $4.0 billion.  That condition has now been satisfied.
 
As of 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 15, 2010, approximately $1.49 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes, or 34.0% of the outstanding principal amount, had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Any and All Offer and approximately $0.24 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, or 7.6% of the outstanding principal amount, had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer.
 
The Company has retained Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. to serve as coordinating dealer managers and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and BofA Merrill Lynch to serve as dealer managers and D.F. King & Co., Inc. to serve as the tender and information agent for the tender offers.
