("CCR"), and the 7.375% Notes due July 29, 2093 issued by the Company.
 
In the Any and All Offer, according to information provided by D. F. King & Co., Inc., the tender agent for the offers, $1.85 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer at 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 22, 2010 as more fully set forth below. The Company has accepted for payment all notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Any and All Offer and expects to make payment for the notes in same-day funds today.
 
 
 
The Company has set the maximum principal amount of notes to be purchased pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer as $1,601,783,000. Such maximum amount is equal to the difference between US$3,450,000,000 and the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Any and All Offer. The amounts of each series of notes to be purchased in the Maximum Tender Offer are prioritized and may be prorated as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, as supplemented on November 16, 2010.
 
The Maximum Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., EST, on December 14, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated.

Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date will be eligible to receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total consideration minus $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holder that are accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date may not withdraw their notes except in the limited circumstances described fully in the Offer to Purchase.
 
The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer will be determined in the
manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to a fixed spread specified for each series of the notes over the yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security specified on the cover page of the Offer to Purchase, as calculated by the dealer managers at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010.  In addition to the total consideration or the tender offer consideration, as applicable, accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered notes accepted in the Maximum Tender Offer. The settlement date for the Maximum Tender Offer is currently expected to be Wednesday, December 15, 2010.
