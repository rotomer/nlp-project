Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On February 15, 2012 (the "Effective Date"), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of The Coca-Cola Company (the "Company") adopted new form award agreements relating to restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance share units ("PSUs") under The Coca-Cola Company 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "1989 Restricted Stock Plan").  Four form award agreements relating to RSUs were adopted to more precisely describe the terms of RSUs, including whether dividend equivalents will be paid during the vesting period and the applicability of vesting provisions upon attaining certain age and service requirements, and to revise certain tax-related provisions. Two form award agreements relating to PSUs were adopted to revise certain tax-related provisions and to clarify terms and conditions.
 
The adoption of the foregoing form award agreements was approved by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the authority granted to the Compensation Committee under the terms of the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan.  The nature of these actions did not require shareowner approval under the terms of the 1989 Restricted Stock Plan, applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the form award agreements are qualified in their entirety by the applicable form award agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.6 and incorporated herein by reference.

Taxes
.
 
(a)
                                
The Company and the Recipient's employer (the "Employer") will evaluate the requirements regarding any and all income taxes, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, and other tax items related to the Recipient's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Recipient (the "Tax-Related Items").  The Recipient acknowledges that these requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change.
 
(b)
                                
Before any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Employer to satisfy all obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Recipient authorizes the Company, the Employer, and their respective agents to satisfy the obligations associated with all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
(1)
                                
withholding from the Recipient's wages or other cash compensation paid by the Company or the Employer, or any other payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient from the Company or the Employer; or
(2)
                                
withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired under an Award, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Recipient's behalf in accordance with this authorization); or
(3)
                                
retention of or withholding in Shares to be issued under the Award.
 
To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum statutory withholding requirements or other applicable withholding rates.
 
If the obligation for any Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, the Recipient is deemed for tax purposes to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award.  This applies even though Shares are retained to satisfy the obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items resulting from any aspect of the Recipient's participation in the Plan.
 
In addition, the Recipient must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Recipient's participation in the Plan if those obligations cannot be satisfied through any of the means described in this document.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares if the Recipient fails to comply with the Recipient's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
(c)
                                 
Irrespective of the Company's or the Employer's action or inaction concerning the Tax-Related Items, the Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for the Tax-Related Items remains the responsibility and liability of the Recipient or the Recipient's estate and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Recipient further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting, settlement, or release of the Award, the issuance of Shares upon settlement or release of the Award, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Award, and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Recipient's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Recipient has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient acknowledges that the Companyand the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  For Recipients who are International Service Associates or covered by another international service policy, all Tax-Related Items remain the Recipient's responsibility, except as expressly provided in the Company's International Service Policy or Tax Equalization Policy.
 
(7)
                                
Compensation Committee
.  The Recipient hereby agrees that (a) any change, interpretation, determination or modification of this Agreement by the Compensation Committee shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and on all persons including the Company and the Recipient; provided, however, that with respect to any amendment or modification of the Plan which affects the award of Shares made hereby, the Compensation Committee shall have determined that such amendment or modification is in the best interests of the Recipient of such award; and (b) this Agreement and the award of Shares shall not affect in any way the right of the Recipient's employer to terminate or change the employment of the Recipient.
 
(8)
                          
Prohibited Activities
.

Before any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Employer to satisfy all obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items.

The Recipient acknowledges that these requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change.
 
(b)
                                
Before any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Employer to satisfy all obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Recipient authorizes the Company, the Employer, and their respective agents to satisfy the obligations associated with all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
(1)
                                
withholding from the Recipient's wages or other cash compensation paid by the Company or the Employer, or any other payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient from the Company or the Employer; or

withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired under an Award, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Recipient's behalf in accordance with this authorization); or
(3)
                                
retention of or withholding in Shares to be issued under the Award.
 
To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum statutory withholding requirements or other applicable withholding rates.
 
If the obligation for any Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, the Recipient is deemed for tax purposes to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award.  This applies even though Shares are retained to satisfy the obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items resulting from any aspect of the Recipient's participation in the Plan.
 
In addition, the Recipient must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Recipient's participation in the Plan if those obligations cannot be satisfied through any of the means described in this document.

(c)
                                 
Irrespective of the Company's or the Employer's action or inaction concerning the Tax-Related Items, the Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for the Tax-Related Items remains the responsibility and liability of the Recipient or the Recipient's estate and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Recipient further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the grant,
 
vesting, settlement, or release of the Award, the issuance of Shares upon settlement or release of the Award, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Award, and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Recipient's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Recipient has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient acknowledges that the Companyand the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  For Recipients who are International Service Associates or covered by another international service policy, all Tax-Related Items remain the Recipient's responsibility, except as expressly provided in the Company's International Service Policy or Tax Equalization Policy.

Compensation Committee
.  The Recipient hereby agrees that (a) any change, interpretation, determination or modification of this Agreement by the Compensation Committee shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and on all persons including the Company and the Recipient; provided, however, that with respect to any amendment or modification of the Plan which affects the award of Shares made hereby, the Compensation Committee shall have determined that such amendment or modification is in the best interests of the Recipient of such award; and (b) this Agreement and the award of Shares shall not affect in any way the right of the Recipient's employer to terminate or change the employment of the Recipient.

The Company and the Recipient's employer (the "Employer") will evaluate the requirements regarding any and all income taxes, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, and other tax items related to the Recipient's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Recipient (the "Tax-Related Items").  The Recipient acknowledges that these requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change.
 
(b)
                                     
Before any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Employer to satisfy all obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Recipient authorizes the Company, the Employer, and their respective agents to satisfy the obligations associated with all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
(1)
                                     
withholding from the Recipient's wages or other cash compensation paid by the Company or the Employer, or any other payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient from the Company or the Employer; or

retention of or withholding in Shares to be issued under the Award.
 
To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum statutory withholding requirements or other applicable withholding rates.
 
If the obligation for any Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, the Recipient is deemed for tax purposes to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award.  This applies even though Shares are retained to satisfy the obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items resulting from any aspect of the Recipient's participation in the Plan.
 
In addition, the Recipient must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Recipient's participation in the Plan if those obligations cannot be satisfied through any of the means described in this document.

Irrespective of the Company's or the Employer's action or inaction concerning the Tax-Related Items, the Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for the Tax-Related Items remains the responsibility and liability of the Recipient or the Recipient's estate and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.

Further, if the Recipient has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient acknowledges that the Companyand the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  For Recipients who are International Service Associates or covered by another international service policy, all Tax-Related Items remain the Recipient's responsibility, except as expressly provided in the Company's International Service Policy or Tax Equalization Policy.

Taxes
.
 
(a)
                                 
The Company and the Recipient's employer (the "Employer") will evaluate the requirements regarding any and all income taxes, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, and other tax items related to the Recipient's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Recipient (the "Tax-Related Items").  The Recipient acknowledges that these requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change.
 
(b)
                                
Before any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the Employer to satisfy all obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Recipient authorizes the Company, the Employer, and their respective agents to satisfy the obligations associated with all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
(1)
                                 
withholding from the Recipient's wages or other cash compensation paid by the Company or the Employer, or any other payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient from the Company or the Employer; or
(2)
                                 
withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired under an Award, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Recipient's behalf in accordance with this authorization); or
(3)
                                 
retention of or withholding in Shares to be issued under the Award.
 
To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering minimum statutory withholding requirements or other applicable withholding rates.
 
If the obligation for any Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, the Recipient is deemed for tax purposes to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award.  This applies even though Shares are retained to satisfy the obligations associated with the Tax-Related Items resulting from any aspect of the Recipient's participation in the Plan.
 
In addition, the Recipient must pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Recipient's participation in the Plan if those obligations cannot be satisfied through any of the means described in this document.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares if the Recipient fails to comply with the Recipient's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
(c)
                                 
Irrespective of the Company's or the Employer's action or inaction concerning the Tax-Related Items, the Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for the Tax-Related Items remains the responsibility and liability of the Recipient or the Recipient's estate and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Recipient further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting, settlement, or release of the Award, the issuance of Shares upon settlement or release of the Award, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Award, and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Recipient's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Recipient has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Recipient acknowledges that the Companyand the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  For Recipients who are International Service Associates or covered by another international service policy, all Tax-Related Items remain the Recipient's responsibility, except as expressly provided in the Company's International Service Policy or Tax Equalization Policy.

.  The Recipient hereby agrees that (a) any change, interpretation, determination or modification of this Agreement by the Compensation Committee shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and on all persons including the Company and the Recipient; provided, however, that with respect to any amendment or modification of the Plan which affects the award of Shares made hereby, the Compensation Committee shall have determined that such amendment or modification is in the best interests of the Recipient of such award; and (b) this Agreement and the award of Shares shall not affect in any way the right of the Recipient's employer to terminate or change the employment of the Recipient.
