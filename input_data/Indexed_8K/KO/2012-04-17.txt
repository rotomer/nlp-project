THE COCA-COLA COMPANY REPORTS
FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
5% global volume growth with growth across every geographic operating group, and 4% global brand Coca-Cola volume growth
Volume and value share gains across every nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category in which The Coca-Cola Company competes
First Quarter 2012 Highlights
ATLANTA, April 17, 2012
- The Coca-Cola Company reported solid first quarter 2012 results, with strong volume and revenue growth, and volume and value share gains across every nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverage category in which it competes. All geographic operating groups delivered volume growth in the quarter. Four out of five geographic operating groups also delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth, while Europe's comparable currency neutral net revenue growth rounded to even despite a continued volatile macroeconomic environment. This quarter's performance demonstrates that the Company continues to refresh a thirsty world while remaining focused on delivering its 2020 Vision.
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company said,
Our first quarter results underscore The Coca-Cola Company's resilience and a long-term focus on quality growth in every region of the world.
 
Despite a continued mixed global environment, our hardworking teams achieved broad-based volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages globally, with volume growth across every geographic operating group and revenue growth ahead of our long-term growth target.
As we enter the third year and complete the ninth quarter of our 2020 Vision, we continue to see vast opportunities for the Coca-Cola system across the more than 200 countries we serve.
 
We are highly focused on creating value for our consumers, customers, communities and investors through our clear roadmap for growth, investments in our world-class brands, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies, and a global bottling system that is well-aligned for execution.
 
It is these advantages that give us the confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and deliver sustainable growth for the future.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
The Coca-Cola Company reported worldwide volume growth of 5% for the first quarter. Volume growth in the quarter was well-balanced around the world, with solid growth in key developed markets, including North America (+2%), Japan (+3%) and Germany (+3%) as well as strong growth in key emerging markets such as India (+20%), China (+9%) and Brazil (+4%). In addition, high single-digit volume growth continued in countries with per capita consumption of Company brands less than 150 eight-ounce servings per year. Brand health remains strong, with continued improvements in favorite brand scores and growth among consumers who enjoy our brands more than once per week. In the first quarter, we grew global volume and value

share in total NARTD beverages, with volume and value share gains across every beverage category in which we compete. Further, our immediate consumption beverage volume grew a healthy 6% globally in the quarter, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and the ongoing expansion of cold drink equipment placements.
We continued to see growth in sparkling beverages, with global volume up 4% in the quarter, sparkling beverage volume growth across every geographic operating group and gains in global volume and value share. This growth was driven by ongoing investments in our brands and innovation with globally scaled marketing campaigns, starting with brand Coca-Cola. Brand Coca-Cola volume grew 4% in the quarter, with quality growth in many developed markets around the world, including Germany (+4%), the United States (+1%), Italy (+5%) and Spain (+3%) as well as in many emerging markets, including Brazil (+1%), Russia (+20%), India (+27%) and China (+5%). In addition, global Fanta and Sprite volume each grew 4% in the quarter, reflecting a balanced portfolio approach to growth in the important sparkling beverage category.
Worldwide still beverage volume grew 9% in the quarter, with growth across most beverage categories, including packaged water, ready-to-drink tea and coffee, energy drinks and sports drinks. We grew global volume and value share in total still beverages as well as across all still beverage categories in which we compete. Packaged water volume grew 15% in the quarter, with strong growth across all geographic operating groups as we continue to focus on innovative and sustainable packaging and immediate consumption occasions. Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 10%, with continued strong performance of key brands such as Gold Peak and Honest Tea in North America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and Nestea in Europe. Energy drinks volume grew 25% in the quarter driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy brands.

Coca-Cola which grew 9%. Still beverage volume grew 12%. Eurasia and Africa grew value share in total NARTD beverages and held volume share, with volume and value share gains in sparkling beverages and value share gains in still beverages. India sparkling beverage volume grew 19%, driven by strong consumer and trade activation and led by brand
Coca-Cola, up 27%. Russia volume growth was driven by strong growth in sparkling beverages, including brand Coca-Cola, up 20%, and Fanta, up 31%. We gained volume and value share in total NARTD beverages in Russia as well as in sparkling beverages, with value share gains in still beverages.

lagged unit case sales primarily as a result of one less selling day in the current year quarter as well as timing of shipments. Reported operating income was up 4% in the quarter, with comparable currency neutral operating income up 11%, primarily reflecting volume growth and favorable pricing across the group as well as favorable timing of marketing expense.

well as the final phase of our fully integrated Arctic Home program. Coca-Cola Zero volume grew high single digits in the quarter, driven by strong NCAA March Madness activation and continued growth in the foodservice channel. Fanta volume was up 4% in the quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
First quarter reported net revenues grew 6%, with comparable net revenues also up 6%. This reflects a 3% increase in concentrate sales, positive price/mix of 3%, driven primarily by positive pricing, and a 1% positive impact due to structural change. Currency had a 1% unfavorable impact on net revenues in the quarter. Concentrate sales in the quarter lagged unit case sales primarily due to the effect of one less selling day in the current year quarter. However, unit case volume growth on an
as reported
basis only slightly exceeded concentrate sales growth in the quarter. The positive price/mix of 3% in the quarter reflects our fundamental ability to execute global pricing strategies within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases in concert with occasion-based package mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and pricing growth. As a result, we grew global NARTD value share for the 19
th
consecutive quarter, with both volume and value share gains in sparkling and still beverages as well as in every beverage category in which we compete.
Reported cost of goods sold increased 10% in the quarter. Comparable cost of goods sold increased 11% in the quarter, as we cycled lower commodity costs from the prior year quarter, primarily in North America and in the Bottling Investments Group. Currency decreased cost of goods sold by 1% in the quarter. Items affecting comparability in the quarter primarily included gains and losses on commodities hedging.
Reported SG&A expenses increased 3% and comparable SG&A expenses also grew 3% in the quarter. Despite the effect of one less selling day in the current year quarter we captured positive operating expense leverage, as we continue to strategically invest in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently manage our operating expenses.
First quarter reported operating income increased 10%, with comparable currency neutral operating income up 5%, despite a 3% impact due to the cycling of lower commodity costs in the prior year period, as well as the effect of one less selling day in the current year quarter. After adjusting for the impact of cycling lower commodity costs in the prior year period, our comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8% in the first quarter. Items affecting comparability reduced first quarter operating income by $55 million in 2012 and by $224 million in 2011. Currency reduced comparable operating income by 2% in the quarter. Including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates,
we continue to estimate currencies will have a mid single-digit unfavorable impact on operating income for full-year 2012, and the currency impact on operating income in the second quarter is anticipated to be at the high end of this mid single-digit range.

In the first quarter, net share repurchases totaled $845 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter. These repurchases are in line with the targeted range of $2.5 to $3.0 billion in net share repurchases for the full year.
First quarter reported and comparable EPS were both $0.89. Items affecting comparability had no net impact on first quarter 2012 reported EPS and reduced first quarter 2011 reported EPS by $0.04 per share. In both periods, these items included restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives, gains/charges related to equity investees, net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily commodities, and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in first quarter 2012 also included charges related to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide and charges related to the supply of Brazilian orange juice. The net charge in first quarter 2011 also included CCE integration costs as well as charges related to the natural disasters in Japan, partially offset by transaction gains.
First quarter cash from operations increased 8%. Excluding incremental pension contributions, cash from operations increased 13%.
Effective Tax Rate
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was
 
24.1%.
 
The underlying effective tax rate on operations for the first quarter was 24.8%.
 
The variance between the reported tax rate and the underlying tax rate was due to the tax effect of various items affecting comparability, separately presented in this document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule.
 
The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
 
Items Impacting Prior Year Results
First quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due to restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan, partially offset by a gain on the sale of the Company's stake in Chilean bottler Coca-Cola Embonor S.A.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or referred to herein as reported). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as structural changes (acquisitions and divestitures), charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral").
Asset Impairments and Restructuring
Restructuring
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $15 million associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations and other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our recently announced productivity and reinvestment program. These restructuring charges were recorded in other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and reinvestment program.
During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $34 million associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations and other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our productivity initiatives and the integration of CCE's former North America business. These restructuring charges were recorded in other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and CCE integration initiatives.
Productivity and Reinvestment
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $64 million in other operating charges related to our productivity and reinvestment program which was announced in February 2012. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component of this program is a new global productivity initiative focused around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; and data and IT systems standardization. The Company is in the initial stages of defining the costs associated with this new productivity initiative. The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to serve our customers and consumers. We believe our new integration efforts will result in costs of approximately $300 million. As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 to $650 million which will be phased in over four years starting in 2012. We expect to begin fully realizing the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final year of the program. See below for a discussion of the Company's productivity and CCE integration initiatives that were completed in 2011.

Productivity Initiatives
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company reversed charges of $1 million related to a previous accrual associated with our productivity initiatives that began in 2008 and concluded during the fourth quarter of 2011. During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $28 million related to our productivity initiatives. These initiatives were focused on providing additional flexibility to invest for growth and impacted a number of areas, including aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs. This program delivered annualized savings of over $500 million beginning in 2011, exceeding the upper end of our original savings target of $400 to $500 million.
Equity Investees
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company recorded a net gain of $44 million in equity income
(loss)  net. This net gain primarily represents the Companys proportionate share of a transaction gain recorded by an equity method investee, partially offset by our proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by our equity method investees.
During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $4 million in equity income (loss)  net. These charges primarily represent the Companys proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by an equity method investee.
CCE Transaction
During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $119 million, primarily due to the integration of CCE's former North America business. These charges were primarily related to the development, design and initial implementation of our future operating framework in North America. The Company successfully completed this initiative at the end of 2011. We realized nearly all of the $350 million in expected annualized savings by the end of 2011, and the total cost we incurred since the inception of the initiative was $493 million. See above for a discussion of the Company's recently announced productivity and reinvestment program which involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
Transaction Gains
During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recognized a gain of $102 million as a result of the sale of our investment in Embonor, a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile. Prior to this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor under the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded this gain in other income (loss)  net.
Certain Tax Matters
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, and
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $8 million and a net tax charge of $3 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. The net tax benefit recorded during the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
also included the impact of the reversal of certain valuation allowances.
Other Items
Impact of Natural Disasters
On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, resulting in a tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern regions of the country. As a result of these events, the Company made a donation to the Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund which has helped rebuild schools and community facilities across the impacted areas of the country. The Company recorded total charges of $79 million related to these events during the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
. These charges were primarily related to the Companys donation and assistance provided to certain bottling partners in the affected regions.

Other Items (continued)
Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges
The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the benefits of our economic hedging activities. During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
and
April 1, 2011
, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in a decrease to our non-GAAP operating income of $49 million and $36 million, respectively.
Repurchase of Long-Term Debt
During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company repurchased all our outstanding U.K. pound sterling notes that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The repurchased debt had a carrying value of $674 million and included $105 million in unamortized fair value adjustments recorded as part of our purchase accounting. During the
three months ended
April 1, 2011
, the Company recorded a charge of $4 million in interest expense related to the premiums paid to repurchase the debt.
Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl S.A.
During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $20 million due to changes in our ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl S.A. ("Nestl") terminating at the end of 2012. In addition, the Company recorded charges of $3 million during the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, due to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl in the ready-to-drink tea category.
Brazilian Orange Juice
In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the Company began purchasing additional quantities of Florida orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the
three months ended
March 30, 2012
, the Company incurred $6 million of incremental charges related to Brazilian orange juice, including the increased raw material costs.
Currency Neutral
Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.
