Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2012 Highlights
ATLANTA, July 17, 2012 
The Coca-Cola Company today reported solid second quarter and year-to-date 2012 results, with continued strong volume and revenue growth, as well as further volume and value share gains in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company said, We are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results.  We are delivering consistent quality performance in line with our 2020 Vision growth targets, despite a very challenging and increasingly unpredictable global economy.  Notably, we continue to gain global volume and value share by giving our consumers what they are looking for  meaningful brand connections, wide-ranging product and package choices, greater information about our brands, and significant investments in programs that support healthy and active lifestyles, all at the heart of our brand values. 
As we complete the 10
th
quarter of our 2020 Vision, we remain passionately focused on offering a portfolio of brands that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness.  Together with our system bottling partners, our long-term growth plans remain on track and our commitment to enhance the well-being of the consumers, customers and communities we serve around the world is as strong as ever.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
The Coca-Cola Company reported strong worldwide volume growth of 4% in the second quarter and 5% year-to-date. Volume growth in the quarter was well-balanced around the world, with solid growth in key developed markets, including Japan (+4%), North America (+1%) and Germany (+1%), as well as strong growth in key emerging markets such as India (+20%), Russia (+9%), China (+7%) and Brazil (+6%). Volume performance was soft in regions of Europe such as Central and Southern Europe and Northwest Europe and Nordics, both down 5% in the quarter, as a result of the ongoing economic slowdown and unfavorable weather. Volume grew 8% in countries with lower per capita consumption (up to 150 eight-ounce servings per year) of our broad portfolio of beverage products. In the second quarter, we grew global volume and value share in total NARTD beverages, with volume and value share gains across nearly every beverage category in which we compete. Brand health remains strong, with continued improvements in favorite brand scores and growth among consumers who enjoy at least one product from our broad portfolio of beverage brands per week. Through our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel segmentation strategy, we remain closely connected to our consumers with a dual focus on recruitment and affordability. Our immediate

consumption beverage volume continues to grow, up 4% globally in the quarter and 5% year-to-date.
Worldwide sparkling beverage volume grew 2% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. We grew volume and value share in global core sparkling beverages in the quarter. Worldwide brand Coca-Cola volume grew 2% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date, with growth in the quarter across diverse markets, including India (+35%), Russia (+23%), the Philippines (+7%), Brazil (+4%), Germany (+3%) and Mexico (+1%). In addition, worldwide Sprite volume grew 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date and global Fanta grew 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, supported by continued innovation and reflecting a balanced portfolio approach to growth in the sparkling beverage category.
Worldwide still beverage volume grew 9% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with solid growth across beverage categories, including packaged water, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink tea and coffee, sports drinks and energy drinks. We grew global volume and value share in total still beverages as well as across all still beverage categories in which we compete. Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 13% in the quarter, with continued strong performance of key brands such as Gold Peak and Honest Tea in North America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and Fuze Tea, which was launched in Latin America during the quarter. Packaged water volume grew 10% in the quarter, as we continue to focus on innovative and sustainable packaging and immediate consumption occasions. Energy drinks volume grew 21% in the quarter driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy brands.

Trademark beverages. Germany volume grew 1% in the quarter, cycling 7% growth in the prior year quarter, driven by the strong Euro Cup marketing campaign and packaging innovations like the mini can and take home multi-pack crates. Both Northwest Europe and Nordics as well as Central and Southern Europe volumes declined mid single digits in the quarter, cycling mid single-digit growth in the prior year quarter, and affected by poor weather and challenging economic conditions.

as positive price/mix of 3% and a 1% benefit from structural change, primarily related to the acquisition of Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Second quarter reported operating income grew 2%. Comparable currency neutral operating income was even in the quarter, a sequential improvement from first quarter 2012, reflecting the holiday shifts, higher commodity costs and timing of certain expenses

Volume growth in the quarter was broad-based, with 4% growth in Japan
,
7% growth in China, 24% growth in Thailand and 6% growth in the Philippines. Sparkling beverage volume growth was 6% in the quarter, led by 5% growth of brand Coca-Cola, 8% Sprite growth and 11% Fanta growth. Still beverages grew 12% in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in packaged water and 13% growth in ready-to-drink tea. Japan's sparkling beverage volume grew 1% and still beverage volume grew 5%. Importantly, all channels in Japan showed growth, including convenience stores and vending, and we grew volume and value share in total NARTD beverages in the quarter
.
Despite some moderation in China
'
s macroeconomic growth trends this year, sparkling beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter and still beverage volume grew 14%. Importantly, the continued rollout of smaller package offerings across the portfolio generated strong 12% growth in transactions
,
and helped drive volume and value share gains in sparkling beverages during the quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Second quarter reported net revenues grew 3%, with comparable net revenues also up 3%. This reflects a 3% increase in concentrate sales, positive price/mix of 3%, driven primarily by positive pricing, and a 1% benefit due to structural changes. Currency had a 4% unfavorable effect on net revenues in the quarter. As a result, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% in the quarter. Concentrate sales in the quarter were broadly in line with unit case sales. The positive price/mix of 3% in the quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to execute global pricing strategies within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases in concert with occasion-based package and channel mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and pricing growth. As a result, we grew global NARTD value share for the 20
th
consecutive quarter. As we will be cycling higher price/mix comparisons from the prior year in the back half of 2012, we continue to estimate our full-year 2012 consolidated price/mix results to be 1% to 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Reported cost of goods sold increased 5% in the quarter, with comparable cost of goods sold also up 5% in the quarter, reflecting moderately higher commodity costs compared to the prior year quarter, primarily in North America and in the Bottling Investments Group. Currency decreased cost of goods sold by 3% in the quarter. Items affecting comparability in the quarter primarily included gains and losses on commodities hedging. We currently estimate full-year incremental commodity costs of approximately $300 million compared to the prior year
.
Reported SG&A expenses and comparable SG&A expenses both increased 2% in the quarter. Currency decreased SG&A expenses by 4% in the quarter. We captured 1 point of operating expense leverage in the quarter and year-to-date, as we continued to strategically invest in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently manage our operating expenses. We currently expect unfavorable 3% to 5% operating expense leverage in the third quarter, with correspondingly positive expense leverage in the fourth quarter due to the benefit of two additional selling days in the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect slightly positive operating expense leverage.
Second quarter reported operating income increased 4%, with comparable currency neutral operating income up 7%. Items affecting comparability reduced second quarter operating income by $119 million in 2012 and by $177 million in 2011. Currency reduced comparable operating income by 5% in the quarter. Including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates,
we estimate the unfavorable currency impact on full-year 2012 operating income to be at the high end of a mid single-digit range, and the
Page
9
unfavorable currency impact on operating income in the third quarter is anticipated to be 8% to 9%.
Year-to-date net share repurchases totaled $1.6 billion. These repurchases are in line with the targeted range of $2.5 to $3.0 billion in net share repurchases for the full year. On July 10, 2012, Company shareowners approved a two-for-one stock split and an increase from 5.6 billion to 11.2 billion in the number of authorized shares of the Company
'
s common stock. The record date for the stock split is expected to be July 27, 2012, with new shares expected to be distributed on or about August 10, 2012. Each shareowner of record on the close of business on the record date will receive one additional share of common stock for each share held. The stock split will not affect the targeted net share repurchase range for the full year.
Second quarter reported EPS was $1.21 and comparable EPS was $1.22. Items affecting comparability reduced second quarter 2012 reported EPS by a net $0.01 and increased second quarter 2011 reported EPS by a net $0.03. In both periods, these items included restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives, gains/charges related to equity investees, net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily commodities, and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in second quarter 2012 also included charges related to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide and charges related to the supply of Brazilian orange juice. Items impacting comparability in second quarter 2011 also included CCE integration costs as well as charges related to the natural disasters in Japan, offset by a transaction gain.
Year-to-date cash from operations increased 15%. Excluding incremental pension contributions made in first quarter 2012, cash from operations also increased 15%.
During second quarter 2012, the Company paid $531 million under its agreement with Aujan Industries ("Aujan"), one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East, in exchange for 50% of the Aujan entity that holds the rights to Aujan-owned brands in certain territories and 49% of Aujan's bottling and distribution operations in certain territories. The remainder of the investments contemplated under the agreement is contingent upon obtaining certain regulatory and other approvals, which we expect to obtain prior to the end of 2012.

Effective Tax Rate
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%. The underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 23.4%, reflecting an underlying annual rate of 24.0%. The variance between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax effect of various items impacting comparability, separately disclosed in this document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule.
 
The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
Items Impacting Prior Year Results
First quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due to restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan, partially offset by a gain on the sale of the Company
'
s stake in Chilean bottler Coca-Cola Embonor S.A.
Second quarter 2011 results included a net gain of $0.03 per share due to a non-cash gain on the adjustment to fair value of our investment in Mexican bottler Grupo Continental S.A.B., partially offset by restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or referred to herein as reported). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral").
Asset Impairments and Restructuring
Asset Impairments
During the
three months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million due to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the recognition of this impairment, the Company's remaining financial exposure related to this entity is not significant. This impairment charge was recorded in other income (loss)  net.
Restructuring
During the
three and six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $15 million and $30 million, respectively, associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our recently announced productivity and reinvestment program. These restructuring charges were recorded in other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and reinvestment program.
During the
three and six months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $27 million and $61 million, respectively, associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our productivity initiatives and the integration of CCE's former North America business. These restructuring charges were recorded in other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and CCE integration initiatives.

Productivity and Reinvestment
During the
three and six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $54 million and $118 million, respectively, in other operating charges related to our productivity and reinvestment program which was announced in February 2012. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component of this program is a new global productivity initiative focused around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; and data and IT systems standardization. The Company is in the process of defining the costs associated with this new productivity initiative.
The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to serve our customers and consumers. We believe our new integration efforts will result in costs of approximately $300 million.
As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 to $650 million which will be phased in over four years starting in 2012. We expect to begin fully realizing the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final year of the program. See below for a discussion of the Company's productivity and CCE integration initiatives that were completed in 2011.
Productivity Initiatives
During the
three and six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company reversed charges of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, related to previous accruals associated with our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives.
During the
three and six months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $26 million and $54 million, respectively, related to our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives. These initiatives were focused on providing additional flexibility to invest for growth and impacted a number of areas, including aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs. These initiatives delivered annualized savings of over $500 million beginning in 2011, exceeding the upper end of the Company's original savings target of $400 to $500 million.
Equity Investees
During the
three months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded a net charge of $1 million in equity income
(loss)  net. This net charge primarily represents the Companys proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees, partially offset by our proportionate share of a transaction gain recorded by an equity method investee.
During the
six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded a net gain of $43 million in equity income
(loss)  net. This net gain primarily represents the Companys proportionate share of transaction gains recorded by an equity method investee, partially offset by our proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
During the
six months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $4 million in equity income (loss)  net. These charges primarily represent the Companys proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by an equity method investee.

CCE Transaction
During the
three and six months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $68 million and $187 million, respectively, primarily related to the integration of CCE's former North America business. These charges were primarily related to the development, design and initial implementation of our future operating framework in North America. The Company successfully completed this initiative at the end of 2011. We realized nearly all of the $350 million in expected annualized savings by the end of 2011, and the total cost we incurred since the inception of the initiative was $493 million. See above for a discussion of the Company's recently announced productivity and reinvestment program which involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
Transaction Gains
During the
three months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recognized a gain of $92 million as a result of an equity method investee issuing additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per share amount greater than the carrying amount of the Company's per share investment. The Company recorded this gain in other income (loss)  net.
During the
three months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recognized a net gain of $417 million, primarily due to the merger of Arca and Contal, two bottling partners headquartered in Mexico, into a combined entity known as Arca Contal. The Company recorded this gain in other income (loss)  net. Prior to this transaction, the Company held an investment in Contal that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The merger of the two companies was a non-cash transaction that resulted in Contal shareholders trading their existing Contal shares for new shares in Arca Contal at a specified exchange rate. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company holds an investment in Arca Contal that we account for as an available-for-sale security. The Company also recorded a charge of $26 million related to costs associated with the merger of Arca and Contal during the
three months ended
July 1, 2011
. The Company recorded this charge in other operating charges.
In addition to the gain on the exchange of our shares in Contal, the Company recognized a gain of $102 million during the
six months ended
July 1, 2011
, as a result of the sale of our investment in Embonor, a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile. Prior to this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor under the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded this gain in other income (loss)  net.
Certain Tax Matters
During the
three months ended
June 29, 2012
, and
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $25 million and a net tax charge of $16 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. The net tax benefit recorded during the
three months ended
June 29, 2012
also included the impact of the reversal of certain valuation allowances.
During the
six months ended
June 29, 2012
, and
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $33 million and a net tax charge of $19 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. The net tax benefit recorded during the
six months ended
June 29, 2012
also included the impact of the reversal of certain valuation allowances.
Other Items
Impact of Natural Disasters
On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, resulting in a tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern regions of the country. As a result of these events, the Company made a donation to the Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund which has helped rebuild schools and community facilities across the impacted areas of the country. The Company recorded total charges of $4 million and $83 million related to these events during the
three and six months ended
July 1, 2011
, respectively. These charges were primarily related to the Companys donation and assistance provided to certain bottling partners in the affected regions.
Page
24
Other Items (continued)
Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges
The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the benefits of our economic hedging activities. During the
three months ended
June 29, 2012
, and
July 1, 2011
, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating income of $46 million and $26 million, respectively. During the
six months ended
June 29, 2012
, and
July 1, 2011
, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in a decrease to our non-GAAP operating income of $3 million and $10 million, respectively.
Repurchase of Long-Term Debt
During the
three and six months ended
July 1, 2011
, the Company recorded a net gain of $1 million and a net charge of $3 million, respectively, related to the repurchase of certain long-term debt that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl S.A.
During the
three and six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $11 million and $14 million, respectively, due to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl S.A. ("Nestl") in the ready-to-drink tea category. In addition, during the
six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $20 million due to changes in our ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl terminating at the end of 2012.
Brazilian Orange Juice
In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the
three and six months ended
June 29, 2012
, the Company incurred charges of $6 million and $12 million, respectively, related to Brazilian orange juice, including the increased raw material costs.
Currency Neutral
Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.
