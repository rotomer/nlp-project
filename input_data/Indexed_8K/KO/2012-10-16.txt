Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2012 Highlights
ATLANTA, Oct. 16, 2012 
The Coca-Cola Company today reported strong third quarter and year-to-date 2012 results, with solid volume and revenue growth, and continued volume and value share gains in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages, as well as across nearly every beverage category in which the Company competes.
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company said,
We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We continue to deliver consistent and solid performance, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized growth in the quarter across all five of our global geographic operating groups, despite continued volatility in the worldwide economy. We have been able to crack the calculus for growth in this environment. We have done this by consistently investing in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it has ever been. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our wonderful heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives tomorrow.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
The Coca-Cola Company reported strong worldwide volume growth of 4% in the third quarter and 5% year-to-date. Volume growth in the quarter was well-balanced around the world, with growth in all geographic operating groups as well as growth across both developed markets (+2%) and emerging markets (+7%). The Company reported solid growth in key developed markets, including North America (+2%), Japan (+2%) and Europe (+1%), which reported growth across all business units in the quarter. In addition, the Company delivered strong volume growth in key emerging markets such as Thailand (+19%) and India (+15%) in the quarter. Our China business delivered 2% volume growth in the quarter and 6% growth year-to-date.
In the third quarter, we grew global volume and value share in total NARTD beverages, with volume and value share gains across nearly every beverage category in which we compete. Brand health remains consistently strong, with continued improvements in favorite brand scores and growth among consumers who enjoy at least one product from our broad portfolio of beverage brands per week. Through our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel segmentation strategy, we remain closely connected to our consumers with a dual focus on recruitment and affordability. Our immediate consumption beverage volume continues to grow, up 4% globally in the quarter and 5% year-to-date.

Worldwide sparkling beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter and year-to-date. This represents nearly 450 million incremental unit cases year-to-date, or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. We grew volume and value share in global core sparkling beverages in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola and reflecting a balanced portfolio approach to growth in the core sparkling beverage category. Worldwide brand Coca-Cola volume grew 2% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date, with growth in the quarter across diverse markets, including India (+34%), Russia (+18%), Brazil (+3%), Mexico (+3%) and South Africa (+2%)
.
In addition, worldwide Fanta volume grew 7% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date, and Sprite volume grew 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date, as we leveraged global marketing campaigns in locally relevant ways.
Worldwide still beverage volume grew 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date, with solid growth across beverage categories, including packaged water, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink tea and coffee, sports drinks and energy drinks. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, still beverage volume grew 8% in the quarter and year-to-date. We grew global volume and value share in total still beverages and delivered share gains across all still beverage categories in which we compete. Ready-to-drink tea volume grew 13% in the quarter, with continued strong performance of key brands such as Gold Peak and Honest Tea in North America, Ayataka green tea in Japan and Fuze Tea, which we continued to expand across markets worldwide during the quarter. Packaged water volume grew 10% in the quarter, driven by our focus on innovative and sustainable packaging and immediate consumption occasions, most recently with our new
PlantBottle with a Twist
campaign, first aired during the summer 2012 Olympic Games. Energy drinks volume grew 19% in the quarter driven by growth across our global portfolio of energy brands.

(excluding acquired volume) primarily due to timing. For the full year, we expect concentrate sales to be roughly in line with unit case sales. Comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 15% in the quarter. Reported operating income declined 4% in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 11% in the quarter, driven by pricing and product mix, partially offset by increased investments in the business.

strong focus on developing and growing our portfolio of flavored sparkling brands. Brand Coca-Cola volume grew 3% in the quarter while Fanta was up 7% and Sprite was up 6%. Still beverage volume grew 14% in the quarter, driven by ready-to-drink tea, up strong double digits as a result of the newly launched Fuze Tea, as well as 33% growth in sports drinks, 12% growth in packaged water and 8% growth in juices and juice drinks. Both Mexico and Brazil grew volume and value share in the quarter in total NARTD beverages as well as in sparkling and still beverages, with a continued focus on both single-serve and returnable packaging.

campaign as well as double-digit growth in Gold Peak tea and Fuze tea. Our portfolio of juice and juice drink brands grew 6% in the quarter, driven by growth in juice drinks and the Minute Maid Light portfolio, while our premium chilled orange juice continued to gain value share. Our water business grew 4% as Dasani maintained its premium pricing position in the mainstream water segment, supported by our PlantBottle PET packaging.

in the prior year quarter.
 
Year-to-date growth in China is a solid 6%, cycling 15% growth in the prior year.  We remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as a long-term growth driver for our business despite a changing competitive landscape and the current softness in the macroeconomy.
 
Importantly, and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume through a broad range of package offerings, with total transactions up 10% and sparkling transactions up 7% year-to-date. China sparkling beverages gained volume and value share in the quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Third quarter reported net revenues grew 1%, with comparable net revenues also up 1%. This reflects a 5% increase in concentrate sales; slightly positive price/mix, rounding to even, driven by the cycling of higher price/mix comparisons from the prior year; and a 1% benefit due to structural changes, principally the acquisition of bottling operations. Currency had a 5% unfavorable effect on net revenues in the quarter. As a result, comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter, in line with our long-term target. Unit case sales slightly lagged concentrate sales in the quarter. For the full year, we expect unit case sales to be in line with concentrate sales. Our price/mix results in the quarter were in line with our expectations, as the quarter is cycling higher price/mix comparisons from the prior year. Despite the tougher comparisons, we continued to grow global NARTD value share for the 21
st
consecutive quarter. We estimate our full-year 2012 consolidated price/mix results to be 1% to 2%, in line with our long-term target range.
Reported cost of goods sold was even in the quarter, with comparable cost of goods sold up 3% in the quarter, reflecting moderately higher commodity costs compared to the prior year quarter, primarily in North America and the Bottling Investments Group. Currency decreased comparable cost of goods sold by 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter primarily included net gains/losses on commodities hedging. We currently estimate full-year incremental commodity costs of approximately $225 million compared to the prior year
.
Reported SG&A expenses grew 2% in the quarter and comparable SG&A expenses increased 3% in the quarter. Currency decreased comparable SG&A expenses by 4% in the quarter. Operating expense leverage in the quarter declined by 4 points, consistent with the outlook we provided in our second quarter 2012 earnings call. On a full-year basis, we expect to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage, as we will benefit from two additional selling days in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter reported operating income increased 1%, with comparable currency neutral operating income also up 1%. Items impacting comparability increased third quarter operating income by $3 million in 2012 and decreased third quarter operating income by $212 million in 2011. Currency reduced comparable operating income by 7% in the quarter. Including our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates,
we estimate currency will have a mid single-digit unfavorable impact on operating income in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Year-to-date net share repurchases totaled $2.3 billion. These repurchases are in line
Page
10
with the targeted range of $2.5 to $3.0 billion in net share repurchases for the full year. Following shareowner approval, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation on July 27, 2012, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 5.6 billion to 11.2 billion and effect a two-for-one stock split of the common stock. Accordingly, all share and per share data now reflects the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split
.
The stock split will not affect the targeted net share repurchase range for the full year.
Third quarter reported EPS was $0.50 and comparable EPS was $0.51. Items impacting comparability reduced third quarter 2012 reported EPS by a net $0.01 and reduced third quarter 2011 reported EPS by a net $0.04. In both periods, these items included restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives, gains/charges related to equity investees, net gains/losses related to our economic hedges, primarily commodities, and certain tax matters. Items impacting comparability in third quarter 2012 also included charges related to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW) and charges related to the supply of Brazilian orange juice. Items impacting comparability in third quarter 2011 also included CCE integration costs.
Year-to-date cash from operations increased 15%. Excluding incremental pension contributions made in first quarter 2012 and 2011, cash from operations also increased 15%.
Effective Tax Rate
The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. The underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter was 24.0%. The variance between the reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax effect of various items impacting comparability, separately disclosed in this document in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule.
 
The underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately recognized in the appropriate period.
Items Impacting Prior Year Results
First quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due to restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan, partially offset by a gain on the sale of the Company

Second quarter 2011 results included a net gain of $0.03 per share due to a noncash gain on the adjustment to fair value of our investment in Mexican bottler Grupo Continental S.A.B., partially offset by restructuring charges, costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration, and charges related to the natural disasters in Japan.
Third quarter 2011 results included a net charge of $0.04 per share due to restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity initiatives and the CCE integration.

joint venture with Nestl S.A. (Nestl), we have eliminated the BPW joint venture volume and associated concentrate sales from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those countries in which the joint venture is being phased out during 2012. In addition, we have eliminated the Nestea licensed volume and associated concentrate sales in the U.S. due to our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl terminating at the end of 2012. These changes did not materially impact the Company
'
s reported volume results for third quarter or year-to-date 2012 on a consolidated basis or for any individual operating group. However, these changes increased the Company's reported third quarter and year-to-date 2012 volume for still beverages by 2 points and 1 point, respectively, and ready-to-drink tea by 12 points and 8 points, respectively.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as "items impacting comparability" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as relating to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered "items impacting comparability". In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results ("currency neutral").
Asset Impairments and Restructuring
Asset Impairments
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $41 million, respectively, due to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss)  net.
Restructuring
During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $14 million and $44 million, respectively, associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our recently announced productivity and reinvestment program. These restructuring charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and reinvestment program.
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $18 million and $79 million, respectively, associated with the integration of our German bottling and distribution operations as well as other restructuring initiatives outside the scope of our productivity initiatives and the integration of CCE's former North America business. These restructuring charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges. See below for a discussion of our productivity and CCE integration initiatives.
Productivity and Reinvestment
During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $59 million and $177 million, respectively, in the line item other operating charges related to our productivity and reinvestment program which was announced in February 2012. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component of this program is a new global productivity initiative focused around four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; and data and information technology systems standardization.
Page
22
Productivity and Reinvestment (continued)
The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to serve our customers and consumers. We believe our new integration efforts will result in costs of approximately $300 million.
As a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 to $650 million which will be phased in over four years starting in 2012. We expect to begin fully realizing the annual benefits of these savings in 2015, the final year of the program. See below for a discussion of the Company's productivity and CCE integration initiatives that were completed in 2011.
Productivity Initiatives
During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company reversed charges of $6 million and $9 million, respectively, related to previously established accruals associated with our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives.
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $22 million and $76 million, respectively, related to our 2008-2011 productivity initiatives. These initiatives were focused on providing additional flexibility to invest for growth and impacted a number of areas, including aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs. These initiatives delivered annualized savings of over $500 million beginning in 2011, exceeding the upper end of the Company's original savings target of $400 to $500 million.
Equity Investees
During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recorded a charge of $10 million and a gain of $33 million, respectively, in the line item equity income (loss)  net. These amounts represent the Companys proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $36 million and $40 million, respectively, in the line item equity income (loss)  net. These charges represent the Companys proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
CCE Transaction
During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company reversed charges of $5 million related to previously established accruals associated with the Company's integration of CCE's former North America business.
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded charges of $54 million and $241 million, respectively, related to our integration of CCE's former North America business. These charges were primarily due to the development, design and initial implementation of our future operating framework in North America. The Company realized nearly $350 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011 and incurred total costs of $488 million related to this program since its inception. This initiative was completed at the end of 2011. See above for a discussion of the Company's recently announced productivity and reinvestment program which involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business.

Transaction Gains
During the
nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recognized a gain of $92 million as a result of an equity method investee issuing additional shares of its own stock during the period at a per share amount greater than the carrying amount of the Company's per share investment. The Company recorded this gain in the line item other income (loss)  net.
During the
nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recognized a net gain of $417 million, primarily due to the merger of Arca and Contal, two bottling partners headquartered in Mexico, into a combined entity known as Arca Contal. The Company recorded this gain in the line item other income (loss)  net. Prior to this transaction, the Company held an investment in Contal that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The merger of the two companies was a noncash transaction that resulted in Contal shareholders trading their existing Contal shares for new shares in Arca Contal at a specified exchange rate. Subsequent to this transaction, the Company holds an investment in Arca Contal that we account for as an available-for-sale security. During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company also recorded charges of $9 million and $35 million, respectively, related to costs associated with the merger of Arca and Contal. The Company recorded these charges in the line item other operating charges.
In addition to the gain on the exchange of our shares in Contal, the Company recognized a gain of $102 million during the
nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, as a result of the sale of our investment in Embonor, a bottling partner with operations primarily in Chile. Prior to this transaction, the Company accounted for our investment in Embonor under the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded this gain in the line item other income (loss)  net.
Certain Tax Matters
During the
three months ended
September 28, 2012
, and
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $7 million and a net tax benefit of $4 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.
During the
nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, and
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $26 million and a net tax charge of $15 million, respectively, related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. The net tax benefit recorded during the
nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, also included the impact of the reversal of certain valuation allowances.
Other Items
Impact of Natural Disasters
On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, resulting in a tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern regions of the country. As a result of these events, the Company made a donation to the Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund which has helped rebuild schools and community facilities across the impacted areas of the country. During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded total charges of $1 million and $84 million, respectively, related to these events. These charges were primarily related to the Companys donation and assistance provided to certain bottling partners in the affected regions.
Page
24
Other Items (continued)
Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges
The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
The Company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. We believe this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the benefits of our economic hedging activities. During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in a decrease to our non-GAAP operating income of $74 million and $77 million, respectively. During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the net impact of the Company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities described above resulted in an increase to our non-GAAP operating income of $113 million and $103 million, respectively.
Repurchase of Long-Term Debt
During the
three and nine months ended
September 30, 2011
, the Company recorded net charges of $5 million and $8 million, respectively, related to the repurchase and/or exchange of certain long-term debt that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business.
Beverage Partners Worldwide and License Agreement with Nestl S.A.
During the
nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $14 million due to changes in the structure of Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), our 50/50 joint venture with Nestl S.A. ("Nestl") in the ready-to-drink tea category. In addition, during the
nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company recorded charges of $20 million due to changes in our ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl terminating at the end of 2012.
Brazilian Orange Juice
In December 2011, the Company learned that orange juice being imported from Brazil contained residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in the U.S. for use on citrus products. As a result, the Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. During the
three and nine months ended
September 28, 2012
, the Company incurred charges of $9 million and $21 million, respectively, related to Brazilian orange juice, including the increased raw material costs.
Currency Neutral
Management evaluates the operating performance of our Company and our international subsidiaries on a currency neutral basis. We determine our currency neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the Company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period.
