(d) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Paying Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Paying Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Paying Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made available to the Paying Agent on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, such Lender agrees, and the Borrower agrees, to pay or repay to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to the Paying Agent, at (in the case of such Lender) the Federal Funds Rate and (in the case of the Borrower) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (provided that such payment at the Federal Funds Rate or the Base Rate (plus the Applicable Margin) with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance shall not affect the status of such Advance as a Eurodollar Rate Advance). If such Lender shall pay to the Paying Agent such amount, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement from and including the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

During such periods as such Revolving ------------------ Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable Margin plus (z) the Utilization Fee Percentage, if any, payable quarterly in arrears on the third day of each January, April, July and October and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted into a Eurodollar Rate Advance or paid in full; provided that commencing on the -------- date and during the continuance of any Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all outstanding Base Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect for such Base Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) from time to time. (b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving ------------------------ Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (y) the Applicable Margin plus (z) the Utilization Fee Percentage, if any, payable on the last day of each Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of six months or nine months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period, provided -------- that commencing on the date and during the continuance of any Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect for such Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(b). SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference Bank --------------------------- agrees to furnish to the Paying Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Paying Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate (but at least two Reference Banks shall have furnished such information), the Paying Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. (b) The Paying Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Paying Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b), and the rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(b). 18
(c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Paying Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances. SECTION 2.08. Conversion of Revolving Credit Advances. (a) The --------------------------------------- Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Paying Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.02(c), 2.06, 2.07, 2.08(d) and 2.10(c), Convert all or any Revolving Credit Advances of one Type into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that -------- ------- (i) except as provided in Section 2.10(c), any Conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) the Borrower may not Convert any Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances unless such Base Rate Advances are in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Type and aggregate amount of Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for such Advances. (b) Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and, in respect of any notice of Conversion to Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender solely as a result of any failure to Convert on the date specified in such notice, including any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Conversion when such Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. Without prejudice to the survival of any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph shall survive any termination of this Agreement. (c) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances having the same Interest Period shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances. (d) Upon the occurrence of any Default and so long as such Default shall continue, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert any Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended. SECTION 2.09. Optional Prepayments of Revolving Credit Advances. The ------------------------------------------------- Borrower may, upon at least two Business Days' notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and upon at least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Paying Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment -------- ------- pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, such prepayment shall either be made on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advance or shall be made together with payment of all amounts required pursuant to Section 8.03(c). SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs; Illegality. (a) If, due to either (i) --------------------------- the introduction of or any change (including any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or change in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agents), pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such 19
increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agents), the Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, as determined by any Lender, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agents, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances and to Convert Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate and (ii) the Borrower shall forthwith Convert all Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding into Base Rate Advances in accordance with Section 2.08, except that such Conversion may occur, notwithstanding Section 2.08, other than on the last day of the respective Interest Periods for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, if the Borrower has paid all amounts payable under Section 8.03(c). SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower ------------------------- shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, if any, without set-off or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent's Account in same day funds. The Paying Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03(b), 2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or 8.03(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of an extension of the Revolver Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.16, and upon the Paying Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.06(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Paying Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes, if any, in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the Note, if any, held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due to such Lender prior to any sharing under Section 2.12. Nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall impair the obligations of any Lender under Section 2.12, the rights of the Administrative Agents, the Paying Agent or any Lender under Section 8.04 or any other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that the Administrative Agents, the Paying Agent or such Lender may have. (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (when determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and fees shall be made by the Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as 20
the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Base Rate (when determined pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of the definition thereof), the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Paying Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes, if any, shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of -------- ------- interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (e) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Paying Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Paying Agent on such date and the Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Paying Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Paying Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. SECTION 2.12. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall ------------------------ obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.03(b), 2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or 8.03(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances made to the other Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or -------- ------- any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to each such other Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower ----- hereunder or under any Note shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all current or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (including interest, additions to tax, and penalties thereon) imposed by the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof (or, in the event that the Borrower assigns any of its rights or obligations or any interest hereunder or under any Notes, by any foreign country and its political subdivisions in which the assignee is incorporated or is resident), excluding, in the case of each Lender, the Paying Agent and each Administrative - --------- Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). ----- If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the Paying Agent or either Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such 21
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any current or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). ----------- (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender, the Paying Agent and each Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.13) paid by such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including interest, expenses, additions to tax, and penalties) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payments under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. However, in the case of any Taxes not required by law to be deducted by the Borrower from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the Paying Agent or either Administrative Agent, payment under this indemnification must be made by the Borrower only if such written demand has been made within 60 days from the date on which such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes payment of the Taxes to the relevant taxing authority. (d) Within 30 days after the reasonable request therefor by the Paying Agent in connection with any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Paying Agent, at its address referred to in, or determined pursuant to, Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of an official receipt from the jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing payment thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate from the Borrower's treasurer or responsible officer that states that such payment has been made and that sets forth the date and amount of such payment. (e) Prior to or on the Effective Date in the case of each Lender that is a Lender on the Effective Date, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption Agreement, as the case may be, pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Paying Agent, each Lender organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction that is exempt from United States Federal withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under an applicable treaty, with respect to payments under this Agreement has provided or is herewith providing the Borrower or the Paying Agent with an Internal Revenue Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI or other certificate or document required under United States law to establish entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate. A determination of whether a Lender is exempt from United States Federal withholding tax or is subject to such tax at a reduced rate shall be within the reasonable judgment of the Lender. (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.13 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder. SECTION 2.14. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain ---------------- in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Paying Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Lender (each a "Note"), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to ---- the Commitment of such Lender. (b) The Register maintained by the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 8.06(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if 22
appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Paying Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof. (c) Entries made in good faith by the Paying Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Paying Agent or such Lender to -------- ------- make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. SECTION 2.15. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances --------------- shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. SECTION 2.16. Extension of Termination Date. (a) At least 30 ----------------------------- days but not more than 60 days prior to the Revolver Termination Date in effect at any time, the Borrower, by written notice to the Paying Agent, may request an extension of the Revolver Termination Date in effect at such time for a period of 364 days from its then scheduled expiration; provided, however, that the -------- ------- Borrower shall not have made the Term Loan Election prior to the then scheduled Revolver Termination Date. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not earlier than 30 days but at least 20 days prior to such Revolver Termination Date, notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Paying Agent and the Borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Revolver Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the scheduled occurrence thereof at such time, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender with respect to such request. The Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower not later than 15 days prior to the scheduled Revolver Termination Date in effect at such time of the decision of the Lenders regarding the Borrower's request for an extension of the Revolver Termination Date. (b) If all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Revolver Termination Date shall, effective as at the Revolver Termination Date otherwise in effect at such time (the "Extension Date"), be extended for a period of 364 -------------- days from such Extension Date; provided that on each Extension Date, no Default -------- shall have occurred and be continuing, or shall occur as a consequence thereof and the giving of a request for extension shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 are correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such notice and on such Extension Date, as though made on and as of such dates. If Lenders holding at least a majority in interest of the aggregate Commitments at such time consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Revolver Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date, be extended as to those Lenders that so consented (each a "Consenting Lender") but shall not be extended ----------------- as to any other Lender (each a "Non-Consenting Lender"). To the extent that the --------------------- Revolver Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.16 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Revolver Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person; provided that -------- such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13, 8.03 and 8.07, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive the Revolver Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Revolver Termination Date. (c) If Lenders holding at least a majority in interest of the aggregate Commitments at any time consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Borrower may arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees (each such Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to assume a Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment as of the applicable Extension Date being an "Assuming Lender") to assume, effective as of --------------- the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations 23
of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting Lender; provided, -------- however, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a - ------- result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $10,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and provided further that: -------- ------- (i) any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender plus (B) any accrued but unpaid Facility ---- Fees owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (ii) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and (iii) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 8.06(a) for such assignment shall have been paid; provided further that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, - -------- ------- 2.13, 8.03 and 8.07, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Paying Agent an assumption agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Paying Agent (an "Assumption Agreement"), duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such -------------------- Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower and the Paying Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Paying Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall have delivered to the Paying Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and the obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d) If all of the Lenders (after giving effect to any assumptions pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.16) consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of such Extension Date, or shall occur as a consequence thereof, the Revolver Termination Date then in effect with respect to the Commitments of such Consenting Lenders and Assuming Lenders shall be extended for the 364-day period described in subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "Revolver Termination Date" shall, with respect to each Consenting Lender and ------------------------- each Assuming Lender for such Extension Date, refer to the Revolver Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Revolver Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Consenting Lender and each such Assuming Lender. ARTICLE III CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS AND LENDING SECTION 3.01. Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of Section ------------------------------------------------ 2.01.

SCHEDULE 3.01(b) DISCLOSED LITIGATION On November 29, 2001, a lawsuit titled Wade, et al. v. The Kroger Co., et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Kentucky, Louisville Division, against The Kroger Co. The complaint, filed by several former and present management and hourly employees, alleges that Kroger discriminates against African-Americans in compensation, selection, and promotion. The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all other African-American persons similarly situated, are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The case is in the earliest stages of discovery, which currently is ordered to close on March 1, 2003. At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is unable to express any opinion on whether a class will be certified, or whether a Material Adverse Effect is reasonably likely.

EXHIBIT C - FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER To each of the Lenders parties to the Credit Agreement dated as of May 22, 2002 among The Kroger Co., said Lenders, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Paying Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent for said Lenders, and to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Paying Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent The Kroger Co. -------------- Ladies and Gentlemen: As Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), I am familiar with its affairs and, to ------- the extent necessary to render this opinion, the affairs of its subsidiaries and in particular the 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the banking institutions listed on the signature pages thereof (the "Lenders"), Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agents, and Bank of America, N.A., Bank One, NA and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., Chicago Branch and Union Bank of California, N.A., as co-syndication agents. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to the Credit Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in, or by reference in, the Credit Agreement have the meanings assigned to such terms in, or be reference in, the Credit Agreement unless otherwise indicated herein. In connection with the preparation of this opinion, I have examined originals, or certified, conformed or reproduction copies, of such corporate records, agreements, instruments and documents of the Borrower, such certificates of public officials and such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to its preparation and delivery. In all such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of documents of all parties other than the Company and the conformity to original or certified copies of all copies submitted to me as conformed or reproduction copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to such opinions, I have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, statements or certificates of public officials and statements or certificates of officers or representatives of the Borrower and others. I am familiar with the proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that: (1) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties, and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Credit Agreement, and to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Borrower is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which it owns or leases assets or in which the conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), performance, operation, properties or prospects thereof. 1
(2) The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. (3) There are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which, (a) except as set forth in the Credit Agreement, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) purport to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement. (4) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement (a) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (b) do not require any filing or registration with, or approval or consent of, any governmental agency or authority generally applicable to corporations for profit that has not been made or obtained, and (c) do not contravene (i) any provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the Borrower or Regulations of the Borrower and all amendments thereto, or (ii) any present law, or governmental regulation of any governmental agency or authority of the State of Ohio generally applicable to corporations for profit which, to my knowledge, is applicable to the Borrower. (5) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations thereunder, to my knowledge, will not contravene any indenture, loan or credit agreement, lease, guarantee, mortgage, security agreement, bond, note or other agreement or instrument, or any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree, which affect or purport to affect any of the rights or obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, except as disclosed in the Credit Agreement. (6) No authorization, consent, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement. (7) The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms. (8) In general, an Ohio court would give effect to the choice of law provisions in the Credit Agreement which specify New York law as the applicable law (other than instances where Ohio law specifically governs Ohio property, persons or activities, for example, with respect to real property and choice of law rules under the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC")). The Supreme Court of Ohio has validated contractual choice of law provisions. Jarvis v. --------- Ashland Oil, Inc., 17 Ohio St. 3d 189 (1985); Schulke Radio Productions, Ltd. v. - ----------------- ---------------------------------- Midwestern Broadcasting Co., 6 Ohio St. 3d 436 (1983). In the latter case, the - --------------------------- Supreme Court held that the parties may choose the law applicable to their contract unless (i) the state whose law is chosen has no substantial relationship to the parties or to the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice or (ii) application of the chosen law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state having a materially greater interest in the issue than the chosen state and such other state would be the state of applicable law in the absence of a choice by the parties. In addition, Ohio Revised Code ("R.C.") ss. 1301.05 (UCC 1-105) provides generally with respect to UCC matters (not including issues specifically addressed to the contrary by the Ohio UCC, for example, perfection issues governed by R.C. ss. 1309.03 (UCC 9-103)) that when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to Ohio and also to another state, the parties may agree that the law of either Ohio or of such other state shall govern their rights and duties. Under the present circumstances, it would appear that the parties' stipulation that the law of New York should control should be given effect in Ohio. This conclusion is based upon our understanding that the transactions provided for in the Credit Agreement were negotiated primarily in New York, were executed and delivered in New York, and are to be performed, in whole or in part, in New York and that the Administrative Agents and the Paying Agent have their chief places of business outside of the State of Ohio. The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications: (a) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally. 2
(b) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) I express no opinion as to (i) Section 2.12 of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation and (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Ohio wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible. The opinions stated herein are limited to the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Ohio. To the extent the opinions stated herein relate to laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or the State of Ohio, I have assumed for purposes of such opinions that the laws of such jurisdiction are identical to the laws of the State of Ohio. The opinions are limited to the matters on which I have been expressly asked to opine and do not extend beyond such limits. The opinions expressed herein are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person or entity. Very truly yours, 3

of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and (iii) if the Borrower shall select an Interest Period of six months or nine months for any Eurodollar Rate Advances and any Lender shall notify the Paying Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lender of making or funding its Eurodollar Rate Advance for such Interest Period, the Paying Agent shall forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (A) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and (B) the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances having an Interest Period of six months or nine months shall be suspended until the Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and, in respect of any Borrowing comprised of or including Eurodollar Rate Advances specified in such Notice of Borrowing, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender solely as a result of any failure by the Borrower to borrow on the date specified in the Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing, including any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. Without prejudice to the survival of any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph shall survive any termination of this Agreement. (d) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Paying Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Paying Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Paying Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made available to the Paying Agent on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, such Lender agrees, and the Borrower agrees, to pay or repay to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to the Paying Agent, at (in the case of such Lender) the Federal Funds Rate and (in the case of the Borrower) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (provided that such payment at the Federal Funds Rate or the Base Rate (plus the Applicable Margin) with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance shall not affect the status of such Advance as a Eurodollar Rate Advance). If such Lender shall pay to the Paying Agent such amount, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement from and including the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing. (f) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued on reasonable notice from the Borrower to the Paying Agent specifying the date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount, expiration date, beneficiary and other terms thereof. Upon fulfillment of such conditions as the Issuing Bank issuing such Letter of Credit or the Paying Agent may reasonably require, which shall include the conditions set forth in Article III (as though the issuance of the Letter of Credit were an Advance), the Issuing Bank will issue the Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms. The Paying Agent shall notify the Lenders of any issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit on the Settlement Date next succeeding the date of such issuance. 18
SECTION 2.03. Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Borrower agrees to ---- ------------- pay to the Paying Agent for distribution to each Lender until the Termination Date a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") with respect to such Lender's ------------ Commitment, at a rate per annum equal to the Facility Fee Percentage from time to time in effect on the aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment, regardless of usage. The Facility Fees will commence to accrue on the date of execution of this Agreement and will be payable in arrears on (i) the Effective Date, (ii) on the third day of each January, April, July and October and (iii) on the Termination Date. (b) Paying Agent's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the ------------------- Paying Agent, for its own account, such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Borrower and the Paying Agent. (c) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) Upon the issuance, extension --------------------- or renewal of each Letter of Credit by an Issuing Bank, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Issuing Bank a fee in an amount to be agreed upon between such Issuing Bank and the Borrower, payable on the date of such issuance (or on such other date as may be agreed upon by such Issuing Bank and the Borrower). (ii) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Paying Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders (determined in accordance with the respective amounts of their Commitments), a letter of credit fee at the Applicable Margin on the maximum amount available to be drawn on each day under outstanding Letters of Credit issued pursuant to Section 2.01(c) for the account of the Borrower (the determination of such maximum amount to assume the occurrence of, and compliance with, all conditions for drawing referred to therein), in each case payable quarterly in arrears on the third day of each January, April, July and October after the date of issuance until the date each such Letter of Credit shall expire or terminate in accordance with its terms and on the date of such expiration or termination. (d) Transfer Fee; Amendment Fee. (i) The Borrower agrees to --------------------------- pay to each Issuing Bank, upon each transfer or amendment of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower, the normal and customary transfer fee or amendment fee, as the case may be (or such other fee as the Borrower and such Issuing Bank may agree upon), charged by such Issuing Bank upon the transfer or amendment of letters of credit. (e) Letter of Credit Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay to ------------------------- each Issuing Bank, on demand, sums equal to any and all reasonable charges such Issuing Bank may assess, and expenses that such Issuing Bank may pay or incur, relative to the issuance by such Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or to presentment to, or to a payment by, the Issuing Bank thereunder. SECTION 2.04. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) ------------------------------------------- The Commitments shall be automatically terminated on the Termination Date. (b) The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agents, to terminate in whole, or reduce ratably in part (in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), the unused portion of the Commitments (such unused portion having been determined after subtracting the Competitive Bid Reduction and the Facility Usage). (c) The Letter of Credit Facility shall not be reduced until such time as the Commitments shall equal such Letter of Credit Facility, and thereafter shall reduce proportionately with any reduction in the amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.04. SECTION 2.05. Repayment of Revolving Credit Advances. The -------------------------------------- Borrower shall repay to the Paying Agent for the account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Advances owing to the Lenders on such date. SECTION 2.06. Interest on Revolving Credit Advances. The ------------------------------------- Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance owing to each Lender from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: 19
(a) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving ------------------ Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable Margin plus (z) the Utilization Fee Percentage, if any, payable quarterly in arrears on the third day of each January, April, July and October and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted into a Eurodollar Rate Advance or paid in full; provided that -------- commencing on the date and during the continuance of any Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all outstanding Base Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect for such Base Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) from time to time. (b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such ------------------------ Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (y) the Applicable Margin plus (z) the Utilization Fee Percentage, if any, payable on the last day of each Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of six months or nine months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period, provided that commencing on the date and -------- during the continuance of any Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect for such Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(b). SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference --------------------------- Bank agrees to furnish to the Paying Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Paying Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate (but at least two Reference Banks shall have furnished such information), the Paying Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. (b) The Paying Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Paying Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b), and the rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(b). (c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Paying Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances. SECTION 2.08. Conversion of Revolving Credit Advances. (a) The --------------------------------------- Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Paying Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.02(c), 2.06, 2.07, 2.08(d) and 2.10(c), Convert all or any Revolving Credit Advances of one Type into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that -------- ------- (i) except as provided in Section 2.10(c), any Conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) the Borrower may not Convert any Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances unless such Base Rate Advances are in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Type and aggregate amount of Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for such Advances. (b) Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and, in respect of any notice of Conversion to Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender solely as a result of any failure to Convert on the date specified in such notice, including any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Conversion when such Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. Without prejudice to the survival of any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 20
(c) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances having the same Interest Period shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances. (d) Upon the occurrence of any Default and so long as such Default shall continue, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert any Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended. SECTION 2.09. Prepayments. (a) Optional Prepayments. The ----------- -------------------- Borrower may, upon at least two Business Days' notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, and upon at least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Paying Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment -------- ------- pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, such prepayment shall either be made on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advance or shall be made together with payment of all amounts required pursuant to Section 8.03(c). (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If any Lender shall for any --------------------- reason fail to pay the Settlement Amount payable by it on a Settlement Date, on demand by the Administrative Agents the Borrower shall forthwith prepay the Advances in an amount equal to such Settlement Amount, and the Paying Agent shall apply such prepayment in the same manner as is specified in the second sentence of Section 2.18. (ii) The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, pay to the Paying Agent for deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in such Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under Letters of Credit then outstanding (assuming compliance with all conditions to drawing) exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on such Business Day. (iii) All prepayments by the Borrower under this subsection (b) shall be made together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and shall be applied first against the Advances to be prepaid that are Base Rate Advances and thereafter against the Advances to be prepaid that are Eurodollar Advances having Interest Periods ending as close as possible to the date of such prepayment. SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs; Illegality. (a) If, due to --------------------------- either (i) the introduction of or any change (including any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or change in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agents), pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type or of the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agents), the Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of such circumstances, to the 21
extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Issuing Bank or any Lender of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or any participation therein, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Issuing Bank or Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agents), pay to the Paying Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, as determined by any Lender, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agents, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances and to Convert Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate and (ii) the Borrower shall forthwith Convert all Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding into Base Rate Advances in accordance with Section 2.08, except that such Conversion may occur, notwithstanding Section 2.08, other than on the last day of the respective Interest Periods for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, if the Borrower has paid all amounts payable under Section 8.03(c). SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower ------------------------- shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, if any, without set-off or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent's Account in same day funds. The Paying Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, letter of credit fees payable pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03(b), 2.03(c)(i), 2.03(d), 2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or 8.03(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.16, and upon the Paying Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.06(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Paying Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes, if any, in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes (i) each Issuing Bank on behalf of each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made by the Borrower to the Paying Agent when due hereunder, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Issuing Bank any amount so due and (ii) each Lender, if and to the extent payment is not made when due hereunder, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due to such Lender prior to any sharing under Section 2.12. Nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall impair the obligations of any Lender under Section 2.12, the rights of the Administrative Agents, the Paying Agent or any Lender under Section 8.04 or any other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that the Administrative Agents, the Paying Agent or such Lender may have. 22
(c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (when determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and fees shall be made by the Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on Base Rate (when determined pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of the definition thereof), the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or facility fees are payable. Each determination by the Paying Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes, if any, shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of -------- ------- interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (e) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Paying Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Paying Agent on such date and the Paying Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Paying Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Paying Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. SECTION 2.12. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall ------------------------ obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.03(b), 2.03(c)(i), 2.03(d), 2.03(e),2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or 8.03(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances made to the other Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is -------- ------- thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to each such other Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower ----- hereunder or under any Note shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all current or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (including interest, additions to tax, and penalties thereon) imposed by the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof (or, in the event that the Borrower assigns any of its rights or obligations or any interest hereunder or under any Notes, by any foreign country and its political subdivisions in which the assignee is incorporated or is resident), excluding, in the case of each Lender, the Paying Agent and each Administrative - --------- Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). ----- If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the Paying Agent or either Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such Lender, the Paying Agent or such 23
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any current or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). ----------- (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender, the Paying Agent and each Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.13) paid by such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including interest, expenses, additions to tax, and penalties) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payments under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. However, in the case of any Taxes not required by law to be deducted by the Borrower from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the Paying Agent or either Administrative Agent, payment under this indemnification must be made by the Borrower only if such written demand has been made within 60 days from the date on which such Lender, the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes payment of the Taxes to the relevant taxing authority. (d) Within 30 days after the reasonable request therefor by the Paying Agent in connection with any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Paying Agent, at its address referred to in, or determined pursuant to, Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of an official receipt from the jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing payment thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate from the Borrower's treasurer or responsible officer that states that such payment has been made and that sets forth the date and amount of such payment. (e) Prior to or on the Effective Date in the case of each Lender that is a Lender on the Effective Date, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption Agreement, as the case may be, pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Paying Agent, each Lender organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction that is exempt from United States Federal withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under an applicable treaty, with respect to payments under this Agreement has provided or is herewith providing the Borrower or the Paying Agent with an Internal Revenue Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI or other certificate or document required under United States law to establish entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate. A determination of whether a Lender is exempt from United States Federal withholding tax or is subject to such tax at a reduced rate shall be within the reasonable judgment of the Lender. (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.13 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder. SECTION 2.14. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain ---------------- in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Paying Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Lender (each a "Note"), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to ---- the Commitment of such Lender.

The Paying Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, at least 20 days prior to such Anniversary Date, notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Paying Agent and the Borrower in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the scheduled occurrence thereof at such time, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender with respect to such request.

(b) If all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the next Anniversary Date (the "Extension Date"), be extended for one calendar year; provided that on each -------------- -------- Extension Date, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or shall occur as a consequence thereof and the giving of a request for extension shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 are correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such notice and on such Extension Date, as though made on and as of such dates. If Lenders holding at least a majority in interest of the aggregate Commitments at such time consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date, be extended as to those Lenders that so consented (each a "Consenting Lender") but shall not be extended as to any other Lender ----------------- (each a "Non-Consenting Lender"). To the extent that the Termination Date is not --------------------- extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.16 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person; provided that such Non-Consenting Lender's -------- rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13, 8.03 and 8.07, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.

(c) If Lenders holding at least a majority in interest of the aggregate Commitments at any time consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, the Borrower may arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees (each such Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to assume a Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment as of the applicable Extension Date being an "Assuming Lender") to assume, effective as of --------------- the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting Lender; provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment of any such -------- ------- 25
Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $10,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and provided further that: -------- ------- (i) any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender plus (B) any accrued but unpaid Facility ---- Fees and fees pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (ii) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and (iii) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 8.06(a) for such assignment shall have been paid; provided further that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, - -------- ------- 2.13, 8.03 and 8.07, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Paying Agent an assumption agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Paying Agent (an "Assumption Agreement"), duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such -------------------- Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower and the Paying Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Paying Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall have delivered to the Paying Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and the obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged. (d) If Lenders holding a majority in interest of the aggregate Commitments (after giving effect to any assumptions pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.16) consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of such Extension Date, or shall occur as a consequence thereof, the Termination Date then in effect with respect to the Commitment of such Consenting Lenders and Assuming Lenders shall be extended for the additional one-year period described in subsection (a) of this Section 2.16, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "Termination ----------- Date" shall, with respect to each Consenting Lender and each Assuming Lender for - ---- such Extension Date, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Paying Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Consenting Lender and each such Assuming Lender. SECTION 2.17. Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the -------------------- Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit and under any other agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including to the extent permitted by law, the following circumstances: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (collectively, the "Letter of Credit Documents") or any Loan Document; -------------------------- 26
(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the Letter of Credit Documents or any other Loan Document; (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit; (d) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent or any other Person, whether in connection with any Loan Document, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any unrelated transaction; (e) any statement or any other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or other Loan Document proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (f) payment in good faith by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (g) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever other than the payment in full of all obligations hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower. SECTION 2.18. Special Adjustments of Advances. The Paying ------------------------------- Agent will notify the Lenders of the aggregate amount of Advances (other than Competitive Bid Advances) outstanding upon the occurrence of a Default and at such times and at such frequencies as the Paying Agent or any Issuing Bank in their sole discretion may determine, but in any event not less frequently than weekly (the date of each such notice by the Paying Agent being a "Settlement ---------- Date"). Upon receipt of any such notice, such Issuing Bank or each of the other - ---- Lenders, as the case may be, will forthwith unconditionally pay to the Paying Agent (for distribution by the Paying Agent to such Issuing Bank or each of the other Lenders, as the case may be) such amount (a "Settlement Amount"), if any, ----------------- as is necessary to cause the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances (other than Competitive Bid Advances) to be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the amounts of their Commitments. Upon each payment and distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, each Lender will be deemed from the date of such payment and distribution for all purposes under the Loan Documents (including in respect of interest accruing from such date on the principal amount of such Advances) to have outstanding Advances owed to it in the amount of its ratable share of such Advances as aforesaid; provided that in -------- no event shall any Lender have Advances (other than Competitive Bid Advances) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount greater than such Lender's Commitment.

The Paying Agent agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by the Paying Agent, provided that the failure to give such notice -------- shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Paying Agent under this Section 6.02(f) are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that the Paying Agent may have. 38
(ii) The Paying Agent may also exercise, in its sole discretion, in respect of the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, in addition to the other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York at that time, and the Paying Agent may, without notice except as specified below, sell the Letter of Credit Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Paying Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Paying Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to the Borrower of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Paying Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Letter of Credit Collateral or any part thereof, regardless of notice of sale having been given.

(g) The Paying Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Letter of Credit Collateral if the Letter of Credit Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Paying Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Paying Agent shall not have any responsibility or liability (i) for ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Eligible Securities, whether or not the Paying Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, (ii) for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to the Letter of Credit Collateral, (iii) for the collection of any proceeds from Eligible Securities, (iv) by reason of any invalidity, lack of value or uncollectability of any of the payments received by the Paying Agent from obligors with respect to Eligible Securities, or (v) for any loss resulting from investments made pursuant to Section 6.02(d), except to the extent such loss was attributable to the Paying Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct in complying with Section 6.02(d), or (vi) in connection with any investments made pursuant to Section 6.02(d) without a written request from the Borrower, or any failure by the Paying Agent to make any such investment. (h) Any surplus of the funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and remaining after payment in full of all of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and under any other Loan Document after the Termination Date shall be paid to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

SCHEDULE 3.01(b) DISCLOSED LITIGATION On November 29, 2001, a lawsuit titled Wade, et al. v. The Kroger Co., et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Kentucky, Louisville Division, against The Kroger Co. The complaint, filed by several former and present management and hourly employees, alleges that Kroger discriminates against African-Americans in compensation, selection, and promotion. The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all other African-American persons similarly situated, are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The case is in the earliest stages of discovery, which currently is ordered to close on March 1, 2003. At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is unable to express any opinion on whether a class will be certified, or whether a Material Adverse Effect is reasonably likely.

EXHIBIT C - FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER To each of the Lenders parties to the Credit Agreement dated as of May 22, 2002 among The Kroger Co., said Lenders, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Paying Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent for said Lenders, and to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Paying Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent The Kroger Co. -------------- Ladies and Gentlemen: As Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), I am familiar with its affairs ------- and, to the extent necessary to render this opinion, the affairs of its subsidiaries and in particular the Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the banking institutions ---------------- listed on the signature pages thereof (the "Lenders"), Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agents, Bank of America, N.A., Bank One, NA and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., Chicago Branch and Union Bank of California, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to the Credit Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in, or by reference in, the Credit Agreement have the meanings assigned to such terms in, or be reference in, the Credit Agreement unless otherwise indicated herein. In connection with the preparation of this opinion, I have examined originals, or certified, conformed or reproduction copies, of such corporate records, agreements, instruments and documents of the Borrower, such certificates of public officials and such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to its preparation and delivery. In all such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of documents of all parties other than the Company and the conformity to original or certified copies of all copies submitted to me as conformed or reproduction copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to such opinions, I have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, statements or certificates of public officials and statements or certificates of officers or representatives of the Borrower and others. I am familiar with the proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that: (1) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties, and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Credit Agreement, and to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Borrower is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which it owns or leases assets or in which the conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be 1
licensed except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), performance, operation, properties or prospects thereof. (2) The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. (3) There are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which, (a) except as set forth in the Credit Agreement, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) purport to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement. (4) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement (a) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (b) do not require any filing or registration with, or approval or consent of, any governmental agency or authority generally applicable to corporations for profit that has not been made or obtained, and (c) do not contravene (i) any provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the Borrower or Regulations of the Borrower and all amendments thereto, or (ii) any present law, or governmental regulation of any governmental agency or authority of the State of Ohio generally applicable to corporations for profit which, to my knowledge, is applicable to the Borrower. (5) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations thereunder, to my knowledge, will not contravene any indenture, loan or credit agreement, lease, guarantee, mortgage, security agreement, bond, note or other agreement or instrument, or any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree, which affect or purport to affect any of the rights or obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, except as disclosed in the Credit Agreement. (6) No authorization, consent, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement. (7) The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms. (8) In general, an Ohio court would give effect to the choice of law provisions in the Credit Agreement which specify New York law as the applicable law (other than instances where Ohio law specifically governs Ohio property, persons or activities, for example, with respect to real property and choice of law rules under the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC")). The Supreme Court of Ohio has validated contractual choice of law provisions. Jarvis v. --------- Ashland Oil, Inc., 17 Ohio St. 3d 189 (1985); Schulke Radio Productions, Ltd. v. - ----------------- ---------------------------------- Midwestern Broadcasting Co., 6 Ohio St. 3d 436 (1983). In the latter case, the - --------------------------- Supreme Court held that the parties may choose the law applicable to their contract unless (i) the state whose law is chosen has no substantial relationship to the parties or to the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice or (ii) application of the chosen law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state having a materially greater interest in the issue than the chosen state and such other state would be the state of applicable law in the absence of a choice by the parties. In addition, Ohio Revised Code ("R.C.") (S) 1301.05 (UCC 1-105) provides generally with respect to UCC matters (not including issues specifically addressed to the contrary by the Ohio UCC, for example, perfection issues governed by R.C. (S) 1309.03 (UCC 9-103)) that when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to Ohio and also to another state, the parties may agree that the law of either Ohio or of such other state shall govern their rights and duties. Under the present circumstances, it would appear that the parties' stipulation that the law of New York should control should be given effect in Ohio. This conclusion is based upon our understanding that the transactions provided for in the Credit Agreement were negotiated primarily in New York, were executed and delivered in New York, and are to be performed, in whole or in part, in New York and that the Administrative Agents and the Paying Agent have their chief places of business outside of the State of Ohio. The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications: 2
(a) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally. (b) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) I express no opinion as to (i) Section 2.12 of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation and (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Ohio wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible. The opinions stated herein are limited to the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Ohio. To the extent the opinions stated herein relate to laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or the State of Ohio, I have assumed for purposes of such opinions that the laws of such jurisdiction are identical to the laws of the State of Ohio. The opinions are limited to the matters on which I have been expressly asked to opine and do not extend beyond such limits. The opinions expressed herein are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person or entity. Very truly yours, 3
