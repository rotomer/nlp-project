purpose of such opinion has been made, and that he is relying upon a general review of the titles of the Company and its subsidiaries, upon opinions of local counsel and abstracts, reports and policies of title companies rendered or issued at or subsequent to the time of acquisition of such property by the Company or its subsidiaries, upon opinions of counsel to the lessors of such property and, in respect of matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both the Underwriters and he are justified in relying upon such opinions, abstracts, reports, policies and certificates); (vi) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject with respect to which there is a reasonable likelihood of determinations which would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; (vii) This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (viii) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered, and the Designated Securities (assuming that (i) the Trustee has all requisite power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture and has made all necessary filings and received all necessary consents, (ii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and (iii) the Trustee's certificates of authentication have been manually executed by an authorized officer of the Trustee) constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, except that (a) such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally, and (b) the enforceability thereof is subject to the general principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion as to the application or effect of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation or preferential transfer laws or any laws governing the distribution of assets of the Company to its stockholders; and the terms of the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (ix) The Indenture (i) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (ii) (assuming that (a) the Trustee has all requisite power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture and has made all necessary filings and received all necessary consents, and (b) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and binding instrument of the Company, enforceable in - 10 -
accordance with its terms, except (a) that such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally, and (b) that the enforceability thereof is subject to general principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion as to the application or effect of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation or preferential transfer laws or any laws governing the distribution of assets of the Company to its stockholders; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; (x) The issuance and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Regulations of the Company or any statute of the United States of America or of Ohio or any other statute known to such counsel or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties; provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion as to the application or effect of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation or preferential transfer laws or any laws governing the distribution of assets of the Company to its stockholders; (xi) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters and as may be required due to the Underwriters' or the Trustees' legal or regulatory status; (xii) The Company is not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; (xiii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein and (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion), when they - 11 -
became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xiv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required - 12 -
to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives letters, dated the respective dates of delivery of such letters, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) [Intentionally Omitted] (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries; (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in - 13 -
this Clause (iii) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus as amended and supplemented; and (i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the - 14 -
Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to a particular offering of Designated Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other - 15 -
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such - 16 -
Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. - 17 -
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 15. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. - 18 -

ANNEX I PRICING AGREEMENT [NAMES OF CO-REPRESENTATIVE(S),] As Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto, ...................., 20.. Dear Sirs: The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Underwriting Agreement, dated ..................... (the "Underwriting Agreement"), to issue and sell to the Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters") the Securities specified in Schedule II hereto (the "Designated Securities"). Each of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and shall be deemed to be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein; and each of the representations and warranties set forth therein shall be deemed to have been made at and as of the date of this Pricing Agreement, except that each representation and warranty which refers to the Prospectus in Section 2 of the Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement in relation to the Prospectus (as therein defined), and also a representation and warranty as of the date of this Pricing Agreement in relation to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities which are the subject of this Pricing Agreement. Each reference to the Representatives herein and in the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement so incorporated by reference shall be deemed to refer to you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

The Company may from time to time, without notice to or consent of the registered holders of the Securities issue further Securities ("Additional Securities"). The Additional Securities will rank equal with the Securities in all respects (or in all respects other than the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Additional Securities, or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of the Additional Securities).

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or any interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of this series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under - 22 -
such Securities of this series and this Indenture insofar as such Securities of this series are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities of this series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities of this series under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article Thirteen. Subject to compliance with this Article Thirteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 1302 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 1303. Section 1303. COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 1301 applicable to this Section, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 501(4) (in respect of the covenants in Sections 1008 through 1010), Section 801 and Sections 1008 through 1010, the Securities of this series and the Holders of Securities of this series, on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities of this series shall be unaffected thereby. Section 1304. CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 1302 or Section 1303 to the Outstanding Securities of this series: (1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 609 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article Thirteen applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities of this series, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, - 23 -
to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of, premium, if any, and each installment of interest on the Securities of this series on the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of interest on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities of this series. For this purpose, "U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are (x) direct obligations of the United States of America for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged or (y) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at the option of the Company thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) as custodian with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt, PROVIDED that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such depositary receipt. (2) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as subsections 501(6) and (7) are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 121st day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period). (3) Such Defeasance or covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest as defined in Section 608 and for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any securities of the Company. (4) Such Defeasance or covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (5) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all - 24 -
conditions precedent provided for relating to either the Defeasance under Section 1302 or the covenant Defeasance under Section 1303 (as the case may be) have been complied with. (6) In the case of an election under Section 1302, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (x) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (y) since the date of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of this series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Defeasance or covenant Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Defeasance or covenant Defeasance had not occurred. Section 1305. DEPOSITED MONEY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BE HELD IN TRUST; OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee--collectively, for purposes of this Section 1305, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of the Securities of this series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities of this series and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of this series, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of this series. Anything in this Article Thirteen to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Defeasance or covenant Defeasance. Section 1306. REINSTATEMENT. - 25 -
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 1302 or 1303 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of this series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Thirteen until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 1302 or 1303; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of this series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subjugated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities of this series to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent." Section 404. REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES. With respect to Securities of this series, Section 1101 of the Indenture shall be deleted in its entirety and the following shall be substituted therefor: "Section 1101. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. The Securities will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Securities or (ii) as determined by a Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption." ARTICLE FIVE GUARANTEE Section 501. GUARANTEE. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guarantees (each a "Guarantee") to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture or the Securities or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantor to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, that (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities will be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Securities and all other obligations of the Company or the Guarantor to the Holders of or the Trustee under the Indenture or the Securities hereunder (including fees, expenses or others) (collectively, the "Obligations") will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Securities; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. If the - 26 -
Company shall fail to pay when due, or to perform, any Obligations, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default under the Indenture or the Securities shall constitute an event of default under this Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Securities to accelerate the Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the Obligations of the Company. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions of the Indenture or the Securities, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Security, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) the maturity of the Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article Five of the Indenture for the purposes of the Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article Five of the Indenture, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of its Guarantee. Section 502. WAIVER OF DEMAND. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. Section 503. GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Trustee or any Holder of the Securities to the security, if any, held for payment of the Obligations. Section 504. NO DISCHARGE OR DIMINISHMENT OF GUARANTEE. Subject to Section 510 of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or - 27 -
otherwise affected by the failure of the Trustee or any Holder of the Securities to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Indenture or the Securities, any other guarantee or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). Section 505. DEFENSES OF COMPANY WAIVED. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company, other than final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each of the Guarantors against the Company or any security. Section 506. CONTINUED EFFECTIVENESS. Subject to Section 510 of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee or any Holder of the Securities upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company. Section 507. SUBROGATION. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right of each of the Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each of the Guarantors hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee or any Holder of the Securities, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Holders in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations, and thereupon the Holders shall, assign (except to the extent that such assignment would render a Guarantor a "creditor" of the Company within the meaning of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code as now in effect or hereafter amended or any comparable provision of any successor statute) the amount of the Obligations owed to it and paid by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee to such Guarantor, such assignment to be PRO RATA to the extent the Obligations in question were discharged by such Guarantor, or make such other disposition thereof as such Guarantor shall direct (all without recourse to the Holders, and without any representation or warranty by the Holders). If (a) a Guarantor shall make payment to the Holders of all or any part of the Obligations and (b) all the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture shall be indefeasibly paid in full, the Trustee will, at such Guarantor's request, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and - 28 -
without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Obligations resulting from such payment by such Guarantor. Section 508. INFORMATION. Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Company's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each of the Guarantors assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities will have no duty to advise the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks. Section 509. SUBORDINATION. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Holders, as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Company, arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise, shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations to the Trustee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any right of subrogation that such Guarantor may have pursuant to this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture is subject to Section 507 hereof. Section 510. TERMINATION. A Guarantor shall, upon the occurrence of either of the following events, be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder if such release and discharge will not result in any downgrade in the rating given to the Securities by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Rating Services: (a) upon any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger or otherwise) of all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor or all, or substantially all, of the assets of such Guarantor, which sale or other disposition is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture; provided, however, that such Guarantor shall not be released and discharged from its obligations under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee if, upon consummation of such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (by merger or otherwise), such Guarantor remains or becomes a Guarantor under any Credit Facility; or (b) at the request of the Company, at any time that none of the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the Company. The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying as to the compliance with this Section. Any Guarantor not so released will remain liable for the full amount of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes provided in this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee. - 29 -
Section 511. GUARANTEES OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. As long as the Securities are guaranteed by the Guarantors, the Company will cause each of its Subsidiaries that becomes a Guarantor in respect of (i) any Indebtedness of the Company which is outstanding on the date hereof and (ii) any Indebtedness incurred by the Company after the date hereof (other than in respect of asset-backed securities), to include in any guarantee given by any such Guarantor, provisions similar to those set forth in Section 510 hereof. Section 512. ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS. The Company will cause each of its Subsidiaries that becomes a Guarantor in respect of any Indebtedness of the Company following the date hereof to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture pursuant to which it will become a Guarantor under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, if it has not already done so or unless the Guarantor is prohibited from doing so by applicable law or a provision of a contract to which it is a party or by which it is bound. Section 513. LIMITATION OF GUARANTOR'S LIABILITY. Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee by such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the United States Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar Federal of state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance. Section 514. CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the United States of America as of the date hereof. Section 515. NO OBLIGATION TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY. Neither the Trustee, any Holder nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies or take any other steps under any security for the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee, such Holder or such other Person is entitled to demand - 30 -
payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Guarantee. Section 516. DEALING WITH THE COMPANY AND OTHERS. The Holders, without releasing, discharging, limiting or otherwise affecting in whole or in part the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor hereunder and without the consent of or notice to any Guarantor, may: (a) grant time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person; (b) take or abstain from taking security or collateral from the Company or from perfecting security or collateral from the Company; (c) release, discharge, compromise, realize, enforce or otherwise deal with or do any act or thing in respect of (with or without consideration) any and all collateral, mortgages or other security given by the Company or any third party with respect to the Obligations; (d) accept compromises or arrangements from the Company; (e) apply all monies at any time received from the Company or from any security to such part of the Obligations as the Holders may see fit or change any such application in whole or in part from time to time as the Holders may see fit; and (f) otherwise deal with, or waive or modify their right to deal with, the Company and all other Persons and any security as the Holders or the Trustee may see fit. Section 517. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THE GUARANTEE. (a) To further evidence the Guarantee set forth in this Article Five, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee shall be endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an officer of each Guarantor. The corporate seal of a Guarantor may be reproduced on the executed Guarantee and the execution thereof may be attested to by any appropriate officer of the Guarantor, but neither such reproduction nor such attestation is or shall be required. (b) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in this Article Five shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Guarantee. (c) If an officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture or a Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates such Guarantee or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless. - 31 -
(d) The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor. ARTICLE SIX MISCELLANEOUS Section 601. MISCELLANEOUS.
