The review covered Kroger's 2001 Form 10-K and its Forms 10-Q from the second and third quarters of fiscal 2002. Among the information requested was an explanation of how Kroger accounts for allowances received from vendors.
 
Kroger complied with the SEC request and no changes to its filings were required.
