Item 2.02. .
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 9, 2004, following a review by an outside compensation consultant, the Board of Directors of The Kroger Co. approved changes to the compensation payable to the non-employee directors of Kroger. Effective January 1, 2005, the cash compensation payable to Kroger's non-employee directors will be as follows:
 
 
 
 
All retainer amounts will be paid in monthly installments.
 
In addition, annually at the Board's regularly scheduled meeting in December, each non-employee director will receive an award of 2,500 shares of restricted stock and 5,000 non-qualified stock options under Kroger's then current long term incentive plan; provided that the award made in 2004 will be 5,000 shares of restricted stock and 10,000 non-qualified stock options in light of the fact that no equity awards were made to non-employee directors in 2003 and 2004, and in response to the Board's outside consultant's observations regarding equity-based compensation. Restrictions on the stock awards will lapse in equal amounts on each of the two annual anniversaries from the date of the award, and the stock options will vest in equal amounts on each of the five annual anniversaries from the date of the grant.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.
