2005 Bonus Plan
 
On March 17, 2005, the Company disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K the establishment of the bonus plan for 2005 for the executive officers, including the named executive officers. Included in this disclosure were the bonus potentials for each of the named executive officers.
 
At meetings held on May 5, 2005, the Compensation Committee and the board of directors met with the Committee's independent compensation consultant and determined that the salaries of the named executive officers met the Company's compensation objectives and will not be adjusted for 2005. As part of that review the board and the Committee also determined that the previously reported bonus potentials of the named executive officers will be increased in the range of 9-12%, effective May 1, 2005.
 
The terms and conditions of the 2005 bonus plan remained unchanged.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.
