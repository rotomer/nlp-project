Steve,
 
As you are aware, recently developed corporate governance standards recommend that a sitting CEO limit the number of public company outside boards on which he/she serves to two. I currently serve on three boards but it is my strong desire to be in compliance with these standards.
 
Thus, I am tendering my resignation from the Board of Directors of The Kroger Co. effective January 19
th
. I do so with regret. I have great confidence in our company's CEO, the management team and the board. Likewise, I'm convinced that the strategic course the company has charted is appropriate, dynamic and destined for success. My regret is that I will not be on the board to enjoy either the journey or the celebration at journey's end.
