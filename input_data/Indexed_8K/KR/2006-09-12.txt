Fiscal 2006 Year-to-Date Results
     
Over the first two quarters of fiscal 2006, total sales increased 8.6% to $34.6 billion. For the same period, identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.8%. The Company now anticipates identical supermarket sales growth of at least 4.0% for the balance of the year, or approximately 4.9% for the full year, excluding fuel. This is the second time the Company has raised its identical sales guidance for fiscal 2006.
     
Net earnings for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 were $515.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share. These results include $0.03 per diluted share for stock option expense to reflect the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). They also include $0.03 per diluted share for legal reserves recorded in the first quarter.
     
For the first two quarters of fiscal 2005, net earnings were $490.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share.
     
Based on its year-to-date financial performance, the Company confirms its guidance for earnings per share growth in 2006 of 6  8%. This guidance includes the effect of the increase in legal reserves recorded during the first quarter.
     
"Our performance through the first half of 2006 indicates we are on track to exceed original identical sales guidance and meet earnings guidance for the year," Mr. Dillon said. "Internal measurements show customers are responding to the investments we have made in service, product selection and pricing. This focus by our associates on the business strategy enables us to achieve our financial objectives."

This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the future performance of the Company. These statements are based on management's assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. Such statements are indicated by the words "anticipates," "guidance," and "on track." Increased competition, weather and economic conditions, interest rates, goodwill impairment, the success of programs designed to increase our identical supermarket sales without fuel, and future labor disputes, particularly as the Company seeks to manage increases in health care and pension costs, could materially affect our expected identical supermarket sales growth and earnings per share growth. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update the information contained herein. Please refer to Kroger's reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further discussion of these risks and uncertainties.

Items identified below should not be considered as alternatives to sales or any other GAAP measure of performance. Identical and comparable supermarket sales are industry-specific measures and it is important to review them in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate identical or comparable sales differently than Kroger does, limiting the comparability of these measures.
Net total debt should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure of performance or liquidity. Management believes net total debt is an important measure of liquidity. Net total debt should be reviewed in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.
The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt to net total debt and compares the balance in the second quarter of 2006 to the balances in the second quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of 1999.
