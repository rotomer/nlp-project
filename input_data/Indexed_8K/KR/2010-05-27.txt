Other Events.
 
On May 14, 2010, the Company filed with the SEC and began making available to shareholders its proxy material for its annual meeting of shareholders to be held on June 24, 2010.  On pages 24 and 25 of the proxy statement a sentence incorrectly reads, "Kroger's sale of fuel in identical supermarket fuel centers was 591.6 million gallons, or 5.3% over the prior year."  The correct amount of fuel sold in fiscal 2009 in identical supermarket fuel centers was 2.465 billion gallons, or 5.0% over the prior year. The bonus calculation, which was based in part on this metric, was correctly reported in the proxy statement.
