The shareholders elected fourteen directors to serve until the annual meeting in 2011, or until their successors have been elected and qualified, adopted amendments to the amended articles of incorporation to provide that director nominees in an uncontested election in which cumulative voting is not in effect are elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast at an annual meeting as well as minor statutory conforming changes, and ratified the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2010.  The shareholders defeated the shareholder proposal to recommend a report on climate change.
