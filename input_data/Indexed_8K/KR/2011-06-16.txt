Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
 
Growth Strategy:
 
Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% over a rolling three- to five-year time horizon.  Including Kroger's dividend, the Company's business model is expected to generate total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%.
 
 Kroger's goal is to produce an average annual return for shareholders that matches or exceeds the S&P 500 index over the time horizon described above, but with less volatility.
 
Our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals, the timing that those earnings occur within the year,
our ability to achieve results near the upper end of our earnings guidance range, our ability to continue to invest in the four key components of our Customer 1
st
 strategy, our ability to strike more of a balance between delivering solid near-term financial results and investing for the future growth of our business, and our ability to deliver operating margins at projected levels, may be affected by
: labor disputes, particularly as the Company seeks to manage health care and pension costs; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors; the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; unexpected changes in product costs; the state of the economy, including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions; the number of shares outstanding; the success of our future growth plans; goodwill impairment; volatility in our fuel margins; increased fuel costs and the effect those increases have on consumer spending; and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins, as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel.  In addition, any delays in opening new stores, or changes in the economic climate, could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets.  Our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition, and sales shifts to other stores that we operate, as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products.  Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations
 
or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation.  Our guidance for LIFO is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory. Our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. Our non-fuel operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated, or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations. 
Our ability to pass along product cost increases will depend primarily upon the reactions of our customers and our competitors to those increases.
Our LIFO charge and the timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year.  Our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected. 
The accuracy of our product cost inflation estimate will depend primarily on weather conditions, supply constraints, unrest in areas of the country in which products are grown or are produced, natural disasters, and the general economic climate. We could fail to achieve fuel margins of 11.5 per gallon if the pattern of rapid changes in fuel costs continues.
Our capital expenditures, and the number of projects that we complete, could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores; development costs vary from those budgeted; our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected; or if current operating conditions fail to improve, or worsen.  Square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities, as well as the timing of completion of projects. 
Our ability to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to maintain our current debt rating,  fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, and pay dividends, could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt, our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated, and our failure to generate expected earnings. 
Any change in tax laws, the regulations related thereto, the applicable accounting rules or standards, or the interpretation thereof by federal, state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate. Should asset values in the multi-employer pension funds further deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated. 
Our incremental expense from rising pension and health care costs could exceed our expectations if health care costs continue to rise faster than projected, if unforeseen medical expenses are incurred under our self-insured health benefit plans, or if the assumptions used to estimate pension expenses differ from actual experience. 
The actual amount of cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation.  Our ability to achieve anticipated operating margins could be affected by all of the factors outlined above that could cause us to fail to achieve our expected earnings and earnings per share growth.
 
Section 9  Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Item 9.01
               
Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 16, 2011  The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) today reported total sales, including fuel, increased 11.0% to $27.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with $24.7 billion for the same period last year. In the first quarter, which ended May 21, 2011, total sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.8% over the same period last year.
 
Identical supermarket sales, without fuel, increased 4.6% in the first quarter over the same period last year. This marks 30 consecutive quarters of identical supermarket sales increases for Kroger.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter totaled $432.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $373.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.
 
"Our Customer 1
st
 strategy is clearly connecting with customers," said David B. Dillon, Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer. "We have shown that our focus on people, products, prices and the shopping experience is meaningful to customers through both good and challenging times. As a result, we achieved strong performance across the company."
 
Details of First Quarter 2011 Results
 
FIFO gross margin was 21.42% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 4 basis points from the same period last year. Supermarket selling gross margin declined 7 basis points without fuel from the same period last year.
 
Kroger recorded a $46.0 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $15.4 million last year. Kroger also increased its estimated LIFO charge for the year to $150 million from the original estimate of $50 million to $75 million.
 
Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) costs were 15.76% of sales.  Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A decreased 36 basis points from the same period last year.  The benefits of leverage from strong sales, productivity improvements and outstanding cost control more than offset rising credit card fees, health care and pension costs.
 
First quarter operating margin was 2.95% of sales.  Excluding fuel, on a rolling four quarters basis the company's operating margin increased by 12 basis points.
 
Financial Strategy
 
Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $573.1 million for the first quarter, compared with $532.2 million for the same period last year.
 
Net total debt was $7.1 billion, an increase of $47.3 million from a year ago. On a rolling four quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio, adjusted for impairment charges in 2010 and 2009, was 1.79 compared with 1.91 during the same period last year.
 
Strong cash flow enabled Kroger to invest $544.3 million to repurchase 23.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $23.55 per share during the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $602.7 million remained under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in March 2011.
 
Fiscal 2011 Guidance
 
Kroger updated its identical supermarket sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2011. The company now expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. The previous guidance range was 3% to 4%.
 
For the full year, Kroger increased its earnings guidance to $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share. Based on the current operating environment, the company expects to achieve results near the top end of this range. The increase reflects the strength of the company's first quarter results and the higher estimated LIFO charge. The original guidance was $1.80 to $1.92 per diluted share.
 
 
"Our guidance for the year reflects the balance we strive to achieve across our business  including strong identical sales growth and outstanding cost control, as well as increased earnings and earnings per share," Mr. Dillon said. "Our Customer 1
st
 strategy will drive increased sales, cash flow and earnings growth well into the future.
"
 
Kroger, the nation's largest traditional grocery retailer, employs more than 338,000 associates who serve customers in 2,449 supermarkets and multi-department stores in 31 states under two dozen local banner names including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. The company also operates 785 convenience stores, 359 fine jewelry stores, 1,035 supermarket fuel centers and 40 food processing plants in the U.S. Kroger, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, focuses its charitable efforts on supporting hunger relief, health and wellness initiatives, and local organizations in the communities it serves. For more information about Kroger, please visit www.kroger.com.
Note: Fuel sales have historically had a low FIFO gross margin rate and OG&A rate as compared to corresponding rates on non-fuel sales. As a result, in addition to disclosing such rates including the effect of retail fuel operations, Kroger also discusses the changes in these rates excluding the effect of retail fuel operations.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the future performance of the company. These statements are based on management's assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. These statements are indicated by words such as "expects," "increased," "guidance," "estimated," "will," and "updated." Aggressive competition, economic conditions, interest rates, goodwill impairment, the success of programs designed to increase our identical supermarket sales without fuel, the impact of increasing fuel costs on consumer spending, and labor disputes, particularly as the company seeks to manage increases in health care and pension costs, could materially affect our expected identical supermarket sales growth and earnings per share. Earnings per share also will be affected by the number of shares outstanding and volatility in the company's fuel margins. Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation. Our results also will be affected by rising commodity costs, the inconsistency of the economic recovery, consumer confidence, changes in government-funded benefit programs, and changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs. Our LIFO charge and the timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will
 
 
be affected by changes in product costs during the year.  Our ability to increase cash flow will be affected by all of the factors identified above. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update the information contained herein. Please refer to Kroger's reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further discussion of these risks and uncertainties.

Items identified below should not be considered as alternatives to sales or any other GAAP measure of performance.  Identical and comparable supermarket sales are industry-specific measures and it is important to review them in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.  Other companies in our industry may calculate identical or comparable sales differently than Kroger does, limiting the comparability of these measures.
 
(a)
         
Kroger defines a supermarket as identical when it has been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters.
 
(b)
        
Kroger defines a supermarket as comparable when it has been open for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations.
 
 
Net total debt should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure of performance or liquidity.  Management believes net total debt is an important measure of liquidity, and a primary component of measuring compliance with the financial covenants under the Company's credit facility.  Net total debt should be reviewed in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt to net total debt and compares the balance in the first quarter of 2011 to the balance in the first quarter of 2010.
