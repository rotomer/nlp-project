The shareholders elected fourteen directors to serve until the annual meeting in 2012, or until their successors have been elected and qualified; approved the 2011 Long-Term Incentive and Cash Bonus Plan; approved executive compensation on an advisory basis;  recommended every "one year" as the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation; and ratified the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent public accounting firm for the year 2011.  The shareholders defeated the shareholder proposal to recommend a revision to Kroger's Code of Conduct.  The final results are as follows:
