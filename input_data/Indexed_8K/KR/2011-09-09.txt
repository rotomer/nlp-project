Growth Strategy:
 
Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% over a rolling three- to five-year time horizon.  Including Kroger's dividend, the Company's business model is expected to generate total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%.
 
 Kroger's goal is to produce an average annual return for shareholders that matches or exceeds the S&P 500 index over the time horizon described above, but with less volatility.
 
Our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals, ,
our ability to achieve results near the top end of our earnings guidance range, our ability to continue to invest in the four key components of our Customer 1
st
 strategy, our ability to strike a balance between delivering solid near-term financial results and investing for the future growth of our business, and our ability to deliver operating margins at projected levels, may be affected by
: labor disputes, particularly as the Company seeks to manage health care and pension costs; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors; the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; unexpected changes in product costs; the state of the economy, including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions; the number of shares outstanding; the success of our future growth plans; goodwill impairment; changes in government-funded benefit programs; volatility in our fuel margins; increased fuel costs and the effect those increases have on consumer spending; our ability to maintain good cost control and to consistently reduce the overall cost to run our business; and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins, as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel.  In addition, any delays in opening new stores, or changes in the economic climate, could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets.  Our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition, and sales shifts to other stores that we operate, as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products.  Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying
energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation.  Our guidance for LIFO is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory. Our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. Our LIFO charge and the timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year.  Our non-fuel operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated, or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations. 
Our ability to pass along product cost increases will depend primarily upon the reactions of our customers and our competitors to those increases.
Our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected. 
The accuracy of our product cost inflation estimate will depend primarily on weather conditions, supply constraints, unrest in areas of the country in which products are grown or are produced, natural disasters, and the general economic climate. We could fail to achieve fuel margins of 11.5 per gallon for the latter half of the year if variability in fuel costs continues.
Our capital expenditures, and the number of projects that we complete, could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores; development costs vary from those budgeted; our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected; or if current operating conditions fail to improve, or worsen.  Square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities, as well as the timing of completion of projects. 
Our ability to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to maintain our current debt rating, fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, and pay dividends, could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt, our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated, and our failure to generate expected earnings. 
Any change in tax laws, the regulations related thereto, the applicable accounting rules or standards, or the interpretation thereof by federal, state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate. Should asset values in the multi-employer pension funds further deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated. 
Our incremental expense from rising pension and health care costs could exceed our expectations if health care costs continue to rise faster than projected, if unforeseen medical expenses are incurred under our self-insured health benefit plans, or if the assumptions used to estimate pension expenses differ from actual experience. 
The actual amount of cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation.  Our ability to achieve anticipated operating margins could be affected by all of the factors outlined above that could cause us to fail to achieve our expected earnings and earnings per share growth.

Earnings release for second quarter 2011, filed herewith.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, September 09, 2011  The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) today reported total sales, including fuel, increased 11.5% to $20.9 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with $18.8 billion for the same period last year. In the second quarter, which ended August 13, 2011, total sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.2% over the same period last year.
 
Identical supermarket sales, without fuel, increased 5.3% in the second quarter over the same period last year. This marks 31 consecutive quarters of identical supermarket sales increases for Kroger.
 
Net earnings for the second quarter totaled $280.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $261.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share.
 
Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain tax adjustments. Without the benefit of these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.41 in the second quarter this year, and $0.38 in the second quarter last year. This 7.9% increase is consistent with Kroger's expectations for the quarter and long term earnings growth expectations of 6% to 8% plus a dividend yield of 1.5% to 2.0%.
 
"We are pleased with Kroger's strong performance this quarter, which we believe is the outcome of our consistent approach to managing the business and executing our Customer 1st strategy," said David B. Dillon, Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our ongoing investments in the four keys  our people, products, prices and the shopping experience  continued to enhance our connection with customers and drive positive identical sales growth."
 
Details of Second Quarter 2011 Results
 
FIFO gross margin was 21.00% of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 53 basis points from the same period last year.
 
Kroger recorded a $34.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $11.5 million in the second quarter last year. Excluding retail fuel sales, the LIFO charge increased 13 basis points as a percentage of sales. Kroger maintained its LIFO charge estimate at $150 million for the year.
 
Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) costs were 16.01% of sales. Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A decreased 20 basis points from the same period last year. The benefits of leverage from strong sales, productivity improvements and outstanding cost control more than offset rising credit card fees, incentive plan, health care and pension costs. In addition, depreciation and rent expense were 16 basis points lower as a percentage of sales, excluding fuel, as compared to the prior year.
 
Second quarter operating margin was 2.33% of sales. Excluding fuel, on a rolling four quarters basis, the company's operating margin increased by 10 basis points.
 
Financial Strategy
 
Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $428.5 million for the second quarter, compared with $402.5 million for the same period last year.
 
Net total debt was $6.9 billion, a decrease of $49.0 million from a year ago. On a rolling four quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio, adjusted for impairment charges in 2010 and 2009, was 1.71 compared with 1.87 during the same period last year.
 
Strong cash flow enabled Kroger to invest $258.6 million to repurchase 10.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $24.30 per share during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $403.4 million remained under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in March 2011. Since the end of the quarter, Kroger has purchased 4.5 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.87 per share for a total of $103.5 million.
 
Fiscal 2011 Guidance
 
Kroger increased its identical supermarket sales guidance for fiscal 2011. The company now expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 4% to 5% for the year. The previous guidance range was 3.5% to 4.5%.
 
Kroger maintained its full-year earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share. Based on the current operating environment, the company expects to achieve results near the top end of this range.
 
"Faced with a sluggish economy, we remain focused on giving better value to our customers," Mr. Dillon said. "We continue making investments that deliver value today and for the future for both customers and shareholders."
 
Kroger, the nation's largest traditional grocery retailer, employs more than 338,000 associates who serve customers in 2,439 supermarkets and multi-department stores in 31 states under two dozen local banner names including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. The company also operates 788 convenience stores, 361 fine jewelry stores, 1,046 supermarket fuel centers and 40 food processing plants in the U.S. Kroger, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, focuses its charitable efforts on supporting hunger relief, health and wellness initiatives, and local organizations in the communities it serves.

Note: Fuel sales have historically had a low FIFO gross margin rate and OG&A rate as compared to corresponding rates on non-fuel sales. As a result, in addition to disclosing such rates including the effect of retail fuel operations, Kroger also discusses the changes in these rates excluding the effect of retail fuel operations.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the future performance of the company. These statements are based on management's assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. These statements are indicated by words such as "expects," "maintained," "guidance," and "updated." Aggressive competition, economic conditions, interest rates, goodwill impairment, the success of programs designed to increase our identical supermarket sales without fuel, the impact of increasing fuel costs on consumer spending, and labor disputes, particularly as the company seeks to manage increases in health care and pension costs, could materially affect our expected identical supermarket sales growth and earnings per share. Earnings per share also will be affected by the number of shares outstanding and volatility in the company's fuel margins. Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes,
 
tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation. Our results also will be affected by rising commodity costs, the inconsistency of the economic recovery, consumer confidence, changes in government-funded benefit programs, and changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update the information contained herein. Please refer to Kroger's reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further discussion of these risks and uncertainties.

Items identified below should not be considered as alternatives to sales or any other GAAP measure of performance.  Identical supermarket sales is a industry-specific measure and it is important to review it in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.  Other companies in our industry may calculate identical sales differently than Kroger does, limiting the comparability of the measure.
 
 
 
(a)   Kroger defines a supermarket as identical when it has been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters.
 
 
Net total debt should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure of performance or liquidity.  Management believes net total debt is an important measure of liquidity, and a primary component of measuring compliance with the financial covenants under the Company's credit facility.  Net total debt should be reviewed in conjunction with Kroger's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt to net total debt and compares the balance in the second quarter of 2011 to the balance in the second quarter of 2010.
