Exhibit 1.1
 
EXECUTION VERSION
 
 
 
 
 
To the Representatives of the
several Underwriters named in the
respective Pricing Agreements
hereinafter described.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
From time to time The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").
 
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing Agreement.
 
1.  Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for which the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives").  The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative.  This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities.  The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.  Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery to such Designated Securities and payment therefor.  The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and prospectus with
 
respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities.  A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted.  The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
 
2.        The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:

(xii)  The Company is not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
 
(xiii)  The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein and (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and
 
(xiv)  The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus with respect to the Designated Securities, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; such counsel has no reason to believe (A) that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rules 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at its effective time (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) that, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Pricing Agreement), the Time of Sale Information (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, (C) that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or (D) that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Form T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they
 
were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;
 
(d)  On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Company who have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives letters, dated the respective dates of delivery of such letters, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
 
(e)  The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer in a form mutually agreed upon;
 
(f)  (i)  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
 
(g)  On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale relating to the Designated Securities and (B) the date of the Pricing Agreement, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries;
 
(h)  On or after the earlier of (A) the Time of Sale relating to the Designated Securities and (B) the date of the Pricing Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following:  (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in this Clause (iii) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented;  and
 
(i)  The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
9.       (a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement related to the Designated Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and in either case (i) or (ii) will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement related to the Designated Securities, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any other prospectus relating to the Securities in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein;
provided
however
 
(b)  Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement related to the Designated Securities, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement related to the Designated Securities, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, in each case in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim;
 
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
 
(d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to a particular offering of Designated Securities.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e)  The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.  (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities,
 
the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
 
(b)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.  If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will
 
reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof.
 
13.  In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement:  Attention:  Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

ANNEX II
 
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
 
(i)  They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
 
(ii)  In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable, prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information examined) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives");
 
(iii)  The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
 
(iv)  On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A)  the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
 
Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(B)  any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(C)  the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(D)  any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
 
(E)  as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and sales of capital stock to employee benefit plans of the Company) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or net assets or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
 
(F)  for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in Clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or operating profit or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the
 
comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
 
(v)  In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives, which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
 
All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) in relation to the applicable Designated Securities for purposes of the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000.

The Additional Securities will rank equal with the Securities in all respects (or in all respects other than the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Additional Securities, or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of the Additional Securities). The Additional Securities may be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and may have the same terms as to status, redemption, or otherwise, as the Securities.
 
The Securities will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time.  The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Securities or (ii) as determined by a Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of (1) the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed and (2) the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) from the redemption date to January 15, 2017 discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").  Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of Securities describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the
 
Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures described herein and in such notice.  The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice.  The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions herein, the Company shall be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions herein by virtue of such conflicts.
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted, together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being purchased.

"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:  (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding number of shares of the Company's voting stock; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Securities and (2) the Holders of the
voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the Holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am familiar with the proceedings taken by The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance of $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.20% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Securities") under an indenture, dated as of June 25, 1999, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly known as Firstar Bank, N.A.), as trustee (as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 25, 1999; the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 25, 1999; the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 25, 1999; the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 22, 1999; the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 22, 1999; the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 22, 1999; the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 11, 2000; the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 11, 2000; the Ninth Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 21, 2000; the Tenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 11, 2001; the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 11, 2001; the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 16, 2001; the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 3, 2002; the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 17, 2002; the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 28, 2003; the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 20, 2004; the Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 15, 2007; the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2008; the Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 27, 2008; the Twentieth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 27, 2008; the Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 25, 2008; the Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 1, 2009; the Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 13, 2010 and the Twenty-Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 19, 2012, the "Indenture") incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement.
 
I have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of a Registration Statement relating to such issuance of the Securities and the public sale thereof on Form S-3 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration Statement") for the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have examined the Registration Statement and the exhibits thereto; the Amended Articles of Incorporation and Regulations of the Company;
 
the corporate minutes of the proceedings of the directors and shareholders of the Company; and such other records and documents as I have deemed necessary in order to express the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
The opinion expressed herein is limited to the laws of the State of Ohio, and, to the extent set forth in the following sentence, the laws of the State of New York, each as currently in effect, and no opinion is expressed with respect to any other laws or any effect that such other laws may have on the opinion expressed herein.  Insofar as the opinions set forth herein are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have relied as to all matters governed by such law upon the opinion dated the date hereof of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, addressed to the Company and filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company to be filed with the Commission, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. To the extent the opinion of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP contains conditions and limitations, I incorporate such conditions and limitations herein.
 
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that, assuming receipt by the Company of payment of the issue price of the Securities, the Securities will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company.
 
The foregoing opinion is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally, as from time to time in effect, and to general equity principles.
 
I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company to be filed with the Commission, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the reference to me in the Registration Statement under the caption "Legal Matters" therein. In giving such consents, I do not admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.

For purposes of this opinion, the "Agreements" are the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreements related to the Debt Securities, dated January 12, 2012, between the Company and the several underwriters party thereto (collectively, the "Underwriters").
 
In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or reproduction copies, of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company, such certificates of public officials and such other documents, and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company and others, in each case as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.  We have examined, among other documents, the following:
 
(a)
         
the Agreements;
 
(b)
        
the Indenture; and
 
(c)
         
a specimen form of the Debt Securities.
 
The documents referred to in items (a) through (c) above, inclusive, are referred to herein collectively as the "Documents."
 
In all such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of original and certified documents and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or reproduction copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to the opinion expressed herein, we have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, the representations and warranties contained in the Documents, certificates and oral or written statements and other information of or from officers or other appropriate representatives of the Company and others and assume compliance on the part of all parties to the Documents with their respective covenants and agreements contained therein.
 
We have assumed, for purposes of the opinion expressed herein, that (i) all of the parties to the Documents are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization; (ii) all of the parties to the Documents have the power and authority to (a) execute and deliver the Documents, (b) perform their obligations thereunder and (c) consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) each of the Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all of the parties thereto; (iv) each of the Documents constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
all the parties thereto (other than as expressly addressed in the opinion below as to the Company), enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms; (v) the Debt Securities have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreements; (vi) all of the parties to the Documents will comply with all laws applicable thereto; and (vii) the Debt Securities conform to the specimen thereof examined by us.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Debt Securities, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Agreements, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.
 
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications:
 
(i)   applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws (or related judicial doctrines) now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally;

(iii) the application of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation, or preferential transfer law or any law governing the distribution of assets of any person now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.
 
We express no opinion as to:
 
(i)  the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Debt Securities or the Indenture relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation;
 
(ii)  the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Debt Securities or the Indenture related to (a) forum selection or submission to jurisdiction (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue in any court or of any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum) to the extent that the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any such provision is to be determined by any court other than a court of the State of New York, or (b) choice of governing law to the extent that the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any such provision is to be determined by any court other than a court of the State of New York or a federal district court sitting in the State of
New York, in each case, applying the choice of law principles of the State of New York;
 
(iii)  the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Debt Securities or the Indenture specifying that provisions thereof may be waived only in writing, to the extent that an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created that modifies any provision of such agreement;
 
(iv)  the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Documents containing any purported waiver, release, variation, disclaimer, consent or other agreement of similar effect (all of the foregoing, collectively, a "Waiver") by the Company under any provision of the Documents to the extent limited by provisions of applicable law (including judicial decisions), or to the extent that such a Waiver applies to a right, claim, duty, defense or ground for discharge otherwise existing or occurring as a matter of law (including judicial decisions), except to the extent that such a Waiver is effective under, and is not prohibited by or void or invalid under, provisions of applicable law (including judicial decisions);
 
(v)           any provision of the Documents purporting to give any person or entity the power to accelerate obligations without any notice to the obligor; and
 
(vi)          any provision of the Documents which may be construed to be in the nature of a penalty.
 
The opinion expressed above is subject to the effect of, and we express no opinion herein as to, the application of state or foreign securities or Blue Sky laws or any rules or regulations thereunder.
 
The opinion expressed herein is limited to the laws of the State of New York, as currently in effect, and no opinion is expressed with respect to any other laws or any effect that such other laws may have on the opinion expressed herein.

The opinion expressed herein is given as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to supplement this letter if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if we become aware of any facts that might change the opinion expressed herein or for any other reason.

Commission, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement (the "Form 8-K"). We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K.
