Growth Strategy
:  Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8%, plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2%, for a total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. Kroger expects this total shareholder return to compare favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling three-to-five year time horizon. Annual earnings per share growth for fiscal 2012 will be higher than our long term model due to a combination of the benefit of a 53rd week, a lower expected LIFO charge compared to 2011, share repurchases, benefits from the UFCW pension plan consolidation and the benefit of Express Scripts transfers.
 
Our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals, as well as the timing that those earnings occur within the year, may be affected by: labor disputes, particularly as the Company seeks to manage health care and pension costs; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including nontraditional competitors, the aggressiveness of competition, and our response to these activities; unexpected changes in product costs; the state of the economy, including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions as well as rising fuel and food prices; the number of shares outstanding; the success of our future growth plans; goodwill impairment; changes in government funded benefit programs; volatility in our fuel margins; increased fuel costs and the effect those increases have on consumer spending; the effect of prescription drugs going off patent has on our  sales and earnings; our expectations regarding our ability to continue to obtain additional pharmacy  sales from third party payors such as Express Scripts; and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins, as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel.  In addition, any delays in opening new stores, failure to achieve tonnage growth, or changes in the economic climate, could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets.  Our ability to increase identical supermarket sales, also could be adversely affected by increased competition, and sales shifts to other stores that we operate, as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products, and the effect that increased numbers of generic pharmaceuticals, which generally carry lower retail prices than brands, have on our sales.  Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation; and the benefits that we receive from the consolidation of the UFCW pension plans.  Our guidance for LIFO is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory. Our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. Our non-fuel FIFO operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated, or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing
of those changes differ from our expectations.  Our LIFO charge and the timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year.  Our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected.  Our capital expenditures, and the number of projects that we complete, could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores; development costs vary from those budgeted; our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected; or if current operating conditions fail to improve, or worsen.  Square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities, as well as the timing of completion of projects.  Our plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders, and maintain our current debt rating will depend on our ability to generate free cash flow and otherwise to have cash on hand, which will be affected by all of the factors identified above, as well as the extent to which funds can be used for those reasons while maintaining our debt rating.   Any change in tax laws, the regulations related thereto, the applicable accounting rules or standards, or the interpretation thereof by federal, state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate. Should asset values in the multi-employer pension funds deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated. Likewise, if health care expenses continue to grow at a faster pace than expected, our incremental cost for those expenses will exceed our expectations.  The actual amount of cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation.  Total shareholder return, and the extent to which it compares favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling three-to-five year time horizon, and our ability to reward shareholders through increased earnings per share,  quarterly dividends, and share repurchases, will be affected by all of the factors identified  above, as well as the ability for the company to pay dividends from free cash flow as contemplated.  Our ability to expand non-fuel FIFO operating margin slightly compared to 2011 could be affected by all of the factors outlined above that could cause us to fail to achieve our expected earnings and earnings per share growth.

Earnings release for first quarter 2012, filed herewith.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 14, 2012  The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) today reported total sales, including fuel, increased 5.8% to $29.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared with $27.5 billion for the same period last year. In the first quarter, which ended May 19, 2012, total sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.3% over the same period last year.
 
Identical supermarket sales, without fuel, increased 4.2% in the first quarter over the same period last year. This marks 34 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales for Kroger.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter totaled $439.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $432.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share.
 
Separately, the company today announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaces the prior authorization, which was exhausted on June 12, 2012.
 
"Kroger's solid first quarter performance demonstrates that our Customer 1
st
 strategy continues to resonate with customers," said David B. Dillon, Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our core business is growing, and we are rewarding shareholders through earnings growth, increasing dividends over time and share buybacks."
 
Details of First Quarter 2012 Results
 
FIFO gross margin was 20.70% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 53 basis points from the same period last year.
 
Kroger recorded a $46.0 million LIFO charge in the first quarters of both 2012 and 2011.
 
Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) costs were 15.36% of sales.  Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A decreased 27 basis points from the same period last year.  Including rent and
 
 
depreciation, it was a 40 basis point reduction. The benefits of sales leverage, strong cost control and execution more than offset rising health care costs and credit card fees.
 
Excluding fuel, on a rolling four quarters basis the company's FIFO operating margin decreased 11 basis points. Kroger continues to expect slightly increasing FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, for the full 2012 fiscal year.
 
Financial Strategy
 
Kroger's strong free cash flow allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 14.6 million common shares for a total investment of $345.3 million.
 
Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $539.1 million for the first quarter, compared with $573.1 million for the same period last year.
 
Net total debt was $7.8 billion, an increase of $662.1 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily the result of the issuance of debt to fund the UFCW pension plan consolidation. On a rolling four quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.91 compared with 1.79 during the same period last year.
 
Fiscal 2012 Guidance
 
Based on the strong results in the first quarter, the company increased its earnings per share guidance to $2.33 to $2.40 per diluted share for fiscal 2012.The original guidance was $2.28 to $2.38 per diluted share.
 
Kroger continues to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3.0% to 3.5%. In accordance with original guidance, this includes the expected negative effect on sales from prescription drugs coming off patent.
 
"We were very pleased with the results of the first quarter. We exceeded our expectations, and as a result raised our earnings per share guidance for the year." Mr. Dillon said. "Through our focus on the
 
customer, we will continue to stand out among food retailers, and drive loyalty, cash flow and earnings growth in 2012 and beyond."
 
Kroger, one of the world's largest retailers, employs more than 339,000 associates who serve customers in 2,425 supermarkets and multi-department stores in 31 states under two dozen local banner names including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. The company also operates 789 convenience stores, 337 fine jewelry stores, 1,109 supermarket fuel centers and 38 food processing plants in the U.S. Recognized by Forbes as the most generous company in America, Kroger supports hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families, and more than 30,000 schools and grassroots organizations in the communities it serves. Kroger contributes food and funds equal to 160 million meals a year through more than 80 Feeding America food bank partners. For more information please visit Kroger.com.
Note: Fuel sales have historically had a low FIFO gross margin rate and OG&A rate as compared to corresponding rates on non-fuel sales. As a result, in addition to disclosing such rates including the effect of retail fuel operations, Kroger also discusses the changes in these rates excluding the effect of retail fuel operations.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the future performance of the company. These statements are based on management's assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. These statements are indicated by words such as "expect" and "guidance." Aggressive competition, economic conditions, interest rates, goodwill impairment, the success of programs designed to increase our identical supermarket sales without fuel, the impact of increasing fuel costs on consumer spending, and labor disputes, particularly as the company seeks to manage increases in health care and pension costs, could materially affect our expected identical supermarket sales growth and earnings per share. Earnings per share also will be affected by the number of shares outstanding and volatility in the company's fuel margins. Earnings and identical supermarket sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions; particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers, create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities, or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation; and the benefits that we receive from the consolidation of the UFCW pension plans. Our results also will be affected by rising commodity costs, the inconsistency of the economic recovery, consumer confidence, changes in government-funded benefit programs, and changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs. Our FIFO operating margin will be affected by changes in product costs during the year, if our estimates of product cost changes or the timing of those changes prove incorrect, and if competitive or other factors cause our margins on product sold to fail to meet our objectives. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update the information contained herein. Please refer to Kroger's reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
