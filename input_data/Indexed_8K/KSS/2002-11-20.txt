(vii)
the statements (1) in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of the DebenturesGeneral," "Description of the DebenturesOptional Redemption,"  "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", (2) in the Registration Statement under Item 15 thereof, and (3) to such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry of responsible officers of the Company, under the caption "Executive Compensation--Employment Agreements" and "--Other Agreements" in the Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders immediately succeeding the filing of the Company's last annual report, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, d ocuments or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein;
(viii)
the Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
(ix)
the statements in the Prospectus under the caption " Certain United States Tax Consequences to Non-United States Holders" insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the United States federal tax laws referred to therein are accurate and fairly summarize the United States federal tax laws referred to therein;
(x)
(1) each document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied when so filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (2) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective or any later date of a filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that, in each case, such counsel need not express any opinion as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data included in or excluded from such do cuments filed pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Registration Statement or that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1 and such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in such documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act or in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than as specified in subparagraph (viii) above insofar as the captions referred to therein relate to provisions of documents and other legal matters); and
(xi)
in addition, such opinion shall state that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, and with representatives of the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel need not pass upon or assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and need not make any independent check or verification thereof (other than as specified in subparagraph (viii) above insofar as the captions referred to therein relate to provisions of documents), on the basis of the foreg oing, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which have led such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective or any later date of a filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data included in or excluded from the Registration Statement or that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1.
Such counsel may also state in such opinion that (i) whenever such counsel indicates that the opinion is with respect to matters within the "knowledge of" or "known by" such counsel, such knowledge means the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and in the documents delivered on the Closing Date by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, and the current conscious awareness of facts of the attorneys currently practicing law with such firm who had involvement in the transaction or such other attorneys presently in the firm whom such counsel has determined are likely, in the course of representing the Company, to have knowledge of the matters covered by the opinion, and that (ii) such opinion is limited to the laws of the United States, the Stat e of Wisconsin and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  As to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Wisconsin, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the United States, such counsel may assume that the laws of such jurisdiction are identical to the laws of the State of Wisconsin.
With respect to subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (v), such counsel may state that the enforceability of the Indenture, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and the Offered Securities may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.  In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow the Trustee to take action based upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial and such counsel may assume that the Trustee will at all times act in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner and in compliance with all laws and regulations.
(d)
The Manager shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Richard D. Schepp, Esq., General Counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

7.
.  (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fa ct required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b)     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses  reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements t hereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c)     In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing (but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7) and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel r elated to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter wi thin the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and (b) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.  All such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the pla intiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceedin g in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)     To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is ap propriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Offered Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Offered Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e)     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underw riter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro
rata
(f)     The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
8.
.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Manager to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by eithe r federal or New York State authorities, or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the reasonable judgment of Morgan Stanley, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
9.
.  If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Manager may specify, t o purchase the Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the amount of Underwriters' Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Underwriters' Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Manager and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate with out liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either the Manager or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
Defaulting Underwriters
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of the Offered Securities; that the Company shall have no further liability to any Underwriter (including any liability for damages, including loss of anticipated profits) for any termination of this Agreement, except as provided i n Section 7 hereof.
provided
10.
.  The respective indemnity and contribution and agreements and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, its officers and the Underwriters set forth in this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 and delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive

Schedule I
___________, 200_
Dear Sirs:
The undersigned hereby agrees to purchase from Kohl's Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), and the Company agrees to sell to the undersigned the Company's securities described in Schedule A annexed hereto (the "Securities"), offered by the Company's Prospectus dated ______, 200__ and Prospectus Supplement dated __________, 200__, receipt of copies of which is hereby acknowledged, at a purchase price stated in Schedule A and on the further terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  The undersigned does not contemplate selling Securities prior to making payment therefor.
The undersigned will purchase from the Company Securities in the principal amount and numbers on the delivery dates set forth in Schedule A.  Each such date on which Securities are to be purchased hereunder is hereinafter referred to as a "Delivery Date."
Payment for the Securities which the undersigned has agreed to purchase on each Delivery Date shall be made to the Company or its order by wire transfer or other immediately available funds at the office of ________, New York, N.Y., at 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on the Delivery Date, upon delivery to the undersigned of the Securities to be purchased by the undersigned on the Delivery Date, in such denominations and registered in such names as the undersigned may designate by written or telegraphic communication addressed to the Company not less than five full business days prior to the Delivery Date.
The obligation of the undersigned to take delivery of and make payment for the Securities on the Delivery Date shall be subject to the conditions that (1) the purchase of Securities to be made by the undersigned shall not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of the jurisdiction to which the undersigned is subject and (2) the Company shall have sold, and delivery shall have taken place to the underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in the Prospectus Supplement referred to above of, such part of the Securities as is to be sold to them.  Promptly after completion of sale and delivery to the Underwriters, the Company will mail or deliver to the undersigned as its address set forth below notice to such effect, accompanied by a copy of the opinion of counsel for the Company delivered to the Underwriters in connection therewith.
Failure to take delivery of and make payment for Securities by any purchaser under any other Delayed Delivery Contract shall not relieve the undersigned of its obligations under this Agreement.
The undersigned represents and warrants that, as of the date of this contract, the undersigned is not prohibited from purchasing the Securities under the laws of the jurisdiction to which the undersigned is subject.
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, but will not be assignable by either party hereto without the written consent of the other.
The acceptance by the Company of a Delayed Delivery Contract (including this contract) is in the Company's sole discretion and, without limiting the foregoing, acceptance of such contracts need not be on a first-come, first-served basis.  If this Agreement is acceptable to the Company, it is requested that the Company sign the form of acceptance below and mail or deliver one of the counterparts hereof to the undersigned at its address set forth below.  This will become a binding agreement, as of the date first above written, between the Company and the undersigned when such counterpart is so mailed or delivered.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
Yours very truly,
