MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  February 24/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported record results for the three months and twelve months ended January 29, 2005.  
Fourth Quarter Results
Kohl's Corporation reported a 32.8 percent increase in net income for the quarter ended January 29, 2005. Net income was $324.9 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared with $244.8 million or $0.71 per diluted share a year ago. Net sales increased to $4.1 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, an increase of 14.5 percent for the quarter. Comparable store sales increased 1.3 percent for the same period.
2004 Fiscal Year Results
For the twelve months ended January 29, 2005, net income increased 25.7 percent to $730.4 million or $2.12 per diluted share, compared with $580.9 million or $1.69 per diluted share a year ago. Net sales increased 13.8 percent to $11.7 billion from $10.3 billion a year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 0.3 percent to last year.
As mentioned in a press release on February 22, as a result of a clarification issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 7th regarding lease accounting, Kohl's Corporation reviewed its lease accounting practices.  In consultation with its external auditors, Ernst & Young, Kohl's Corporation corrected its method of accounting for leases related to store locations that are located on leased land as well as for certain stores with operating leases.  The results above and the attached financial statements for both fiscal 2003 and 2004 reflect these adjustments.  
nd
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We made tremendous progress on our 2004 initiatives and are very pleased with the bottom-line results for the quarter and the year.  Our inventory levels have been appropriately managed, resulting in significantly lower clearance levels and the best gross margin performance in our history.  The in-store shopping experience Kohl's was known for in the past has been restored.  We have made great strides in improving the content in our merchandise and in motivating the customer through our marketing.  In 2005, our focus is to create a fun and exciting shopping experience through continued improvements in merchandise content and new improvements in merchandise presentation.  We will continue to drive market share gains through differentiation in our marketing in the coming year."
Montgomery added, "I am very proud of our over 100,000 associates and the role they played in helping the Company achieve a successful year and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication to serving our customers.  They are the reason you can truly Expect Great Things' from Kohl's in 2005."
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Separately, Kohl's Corporation has decided to early adopt, in the first quarter of 2005, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which modifies SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". This revised accounting standard requires that all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The impact of the adoption of this accounting change on Kohl's Corporation fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share is expected to be a reduction of 8 to 9 cents, with the expense being incurred in approximately equal quarterly amounts throughout the year.  The effect on fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share would have been similar.   As a result, prior period financial statements will be restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provis ions of SFAS 123. The restatements for each of the fiscal 2004 quarters will be included in Kohl's 2005 quarterly releases and 2005 Forms 10-Q.
Expansion Update
During the year, the Company successfully opened 95 new stores, including entries into Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego, Calif.; Memphis, Tenn.; San Francisco, Calif.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Portland, Maine; and Reno, Nevada.
The Company now operates 637 stores in 40 states, compared with 542 stores in 36 states at the same time last year.
The Company plans to open approximately 95 stores in fiscal 2005, split evenly between new market entries and fill-ins in existing markets. In the Spring season, the Company will open approximately 33 stores, including seven stores each in the Northeast, Midwest and Southeast regions and four stores each in the Mid-Atlantic, Southwest and Southcentral regions.
