Exhibit 99.1
National & Retail Trades and First Call, Release: August 11, 2005 at 4:00 PM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  August 11/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported net sales and earnings for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005.  
Kohl's Corporation reported a 27.4 percent increase in net income for the quarter ended July 30, 2005.  Net income was $187.2 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $146.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago.  Net sales for the quarter increased 15.6 percent to $2.9 billion from $2.5 billion a year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 5.1 percent for the same period.
For the six months ended July 30, 2005, net income increased 24.8 percent to $311.9 million or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to $250.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share for the six months ended July 31, 2004.  Net sales increased 15.4 percent to $5.6 billion from $4.9 billion a year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 4.4 percent for the same period.
Second quarter and year-to-date earnings in the current year were impacted by two items.  The Company's income taxes were favorably impacted by $4.9 million due to the resolution of certain state tax matters.  The Company's gross margin was favorably impacted by $2.4 million due to a decision to change its method of accounting for inventory from the last in, first out method (LIFO) to the first in, first out (FIFO) method.
Last year's results reflect the Company's decision to adopt expensing of stock options, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  In accordance with the modified retrospective method, the prior year's results for both the quarter and year-to-date have been restated.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter and for the first half on both the top and bottom lines.  As expected, we continued gaining momentum in comparable store sales in the second quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance for both comp store sales and EPS for the quarter. Looking forward, we continue to target comparable store sales growth in the mid-single digit range for the fall season.  For the year, we continue to target earnings growth of approximately 20% over last year and now expect our earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2005 to be in the $2.42 - $2.50 range."
Expansion Update
During the first half of the year, the Company successfully opened 33 new stores, including its entry into the Buffalo, NY market with three stores; adding seven stores in the Southeast region; seven stores in the Midwest region and four stores each in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, South Central and Southwest regions.  
The Company now operates 670 stores in 40 states, compared with 589 stores in 38 states at the same time last year.
The Company plans to open another 62 stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, four in August and 58 in October. The Company plans to enter the Orlando, FL market with six stores and the Jacksonville, FL market with three stores. In addition, the Company will add 15 stores in the Midwest region, nine stores each in the South Central and the Southwest regions, eight stores in the Mid-Atlantic region, seven stores in the Northeast region and five stores in the Southeast region. In total, the Company plans to open 95 stores in fiscal 2005.
