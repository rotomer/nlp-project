Item 4.01
Changes in Savings Plan's Certifying Accountant
On September 28, 2005, the Kohl's Department Stores, Inc. Savings Plan (the "Plan") notified Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") that it had engaged another firm to be the independent auditor for the Plan.  The decision to change the independent auditors of the Plan was approved by the Kohl's Corporation audit committee and the Plan Sponsor and was made primarily for cost-related reasons.  E&Y continues as the independent registered public accounting firm for Kohl's Corporation.  
The reports of E&Y on the Plan's financial statements for the years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 and through September 28, 2005, there were no disagreements between the Plan and E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to such disagreements in its reports on the Plan.  During the years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 and through September 28, 2005, there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K) with respect to the Plan.
The Plan requested E&Y to furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements.  A copy of such letter is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
The Plan has engaged Virchow, Krause & Co., LLP as its independent auditor, effective September 28, 2005.  During the years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 and through September 28, 2005, the Plan did not consult Virchow, Krause & Co., LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, or any of the matters or reportable events specified in Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S-K.
