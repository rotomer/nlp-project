National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: October 6, 2005 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  October 6, 2005 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended October 1, 2005 increased 9.8 percent over the five-week period ended October 2, 2004. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 0.2 percent.  
For the 35 weeks ended October 1, 2005, total sales increased 14.5 percent over the 35 weeks ended October 2, 2004.  On a comparable store basis, sales for the 35-week period increased 3.7 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our sales performance in the first half of the month continued the strong back-to-school performance we saw in August.  Although we were disappointed in the sales of cold-weather merchandise such as sweaters and outerwear in the second half of the month, we would expect a shift in weather-related demand into October.  We remain comfortable with our previous earnings guidance for the 3 quarter of $0.43 to $0.46 per diluted share."
