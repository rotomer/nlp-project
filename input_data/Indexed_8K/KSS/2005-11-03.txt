National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: November 3, 2005 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  November 3, 2005 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the four-week period ended October 29, 2005 increased 16.8 percent over the four-week period ended October 30, 2004. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 6.2 percent.  
For the quarter ended October 29, 2005, total sales increased 13.7 percent while comparable store sales increased 3.5 percent.  For the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005, total sales were up 14.8 percent while comparable store sales increased 3.9 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased with our sales performance for the month and the quarter.  Although sales of seasonal merchandise like sweaters and outerwear continued to be soft through much of October, these categories strengthened significantly during the last ten days as temperatures turned colder in most of our regions.  We continue to be pleased with our positioning in terms of content and level of inventory as we enter the holiday season.  We remain comfortable with our previous earnings guidance for the third quarter of $0.43 to $0.46 per diluted share."
During the month of October, the Company opened 57 stores. New markets were the Orlando, FL market with six stores and the Jacksonville, FL market with three stores. In addition, the Company added 13 stores in the Midwest region, nine stores in the Southwest region, eight stores in the South Central region, seven stores in the Northeast region, six stores in the Mid-Atlantic region and five stores in the Southeast region. One planned October opening in Beaumont, TX will now open in November.
On October 29, 2005, the Company operated 731 stores in 41 states. The Company will end the year with 732 stores in 41 states.  The Company operated 637 stores in 40 states as of October 30, 2004 and the end of 2004.
