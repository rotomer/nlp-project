Net sales increased to $4.7 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago, an increase of 14.1 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales increased 2.7 percent for the same period.
2005 Fiscal Year Results
For the twelve months ended January 28, 2006, net income increased 19.7 percent to $842.0 million or $2.43 per diluted share, compared with $703.4 million or $2.04 per diluted share a year ago.

The results for fiscal 2005 reflect the Company's decision to adopt expensing of stock options.  In accordance with the modified retrospective method, fiscal 2004's results have been restated.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We made tremendous progress on our 2005 initiatives and are very pleased with the bottom-line results for the quarter and the year.  We concentrated on inventory management, resulting in lower clearance levels and the best gross margin performance in our history.  We have made great strides in broadening our assortment and are receiving positive feedback from our shoppers.  We are attracting new customers and believe we are building momentum as a brand.  In 2006, we will continue to focus on these initiatives: merchandise content, marketing, inventory management and the in-store shopping experience.  These are the building blocks of a great retail strategy."
Montgomery added, "I am very proud of our over 107,000 associates and the role they played in delivering another record year and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication to serving our customers.  They are the reason you can continue to Expect Great Things' from Kohl's in 2006."
