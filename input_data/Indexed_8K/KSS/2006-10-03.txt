For release: October 3, 2006 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  October 3, 2006 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended September 30, 2006 increased 26.1 percent over the five-week period ended October 1, 2005. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 16.3 percent.  
For the 35 weeks ended September 30, 2006, total sales increased 16.2 percent over the 35 weeks ended October 1, 2005.  On a comparable store basis, sales for the 35 weeks increased 7.3 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We are extremely pleased with our sales performance in September.  We continue to see strong sales performance across all lines of business.  All regions of the country experienced double-digit comparable store sales increases for the month.  We are experiencing healthy increases in both transactions per store and average transaction value."
Total sales for the month and year-to-date period include $15.0 million related to the Company's initial recognition of gift card breakage revenue.  Comparable store sales figures were unaffected by the revenue recognition.
As a result of the recognition of the gift card breakage revenue, the Company is raising its guidance for the fiscal third quarter to $0.56 to $0.59 per diluted share from $0.53 to $0.56 per diluted share.
On Thursday, October 5, 2006, the Company will grand open 65 new stores in 30 states across the country.  "This nationwide opening is the largest one-day opening in our history and it continues to build on the momentum we have demonstrated this year.  I am very proud of our associates and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication in achieving our goals," added Montgomery.
