National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: January 4, 2007 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  January 4, 2007 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended December 30, 2006 increased 11.2 percent over the five-week period ended December 31, 2005. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 3.0 percent.  
For the nine weeks ended December 30, 2006 total sales increased 11.7 percent while comparable store sales increased 3.3 percent.
For the 48 weeks ended December 30, 2006, total sales increased 14.4 percent while comparable store sales increased 5.7 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "December's sales results were driven by strong performance over the last two weeks as a result of last-minute shoppers in the fourth week and gift card redemptions in the last week of the month.  This helped offset weak consumer demand of cold-weather merchandise such as outerwear, sweaters, and boots throughout the month."
The Company remains comfortable with its previous earnings guidance of $1.36 to $1.42 per diluted share for the fourth quarter.
On December 30, 2006, the Company operated 817 stores in 45 states, compared with 732 in 41 states at the same time last year.  
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours (from 8:30 AM EST on Thursday, January 4 until 8:30 PM EST on Friday, January 5).  The dial-in number for the replay is (719) 457-0820 and the pass code is 1283354.
