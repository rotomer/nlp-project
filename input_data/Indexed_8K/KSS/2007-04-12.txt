National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: April 12, 2007 at 8:30 AM (DST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  April 12, 2007 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended April 7, 2007 increased 25.4 percent over the five-week period ended April 1, 2006. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 16.8 percent.  For the nine weeks ended April 7, 2007, total sales increased 20.4 percent while comparable store sales increased 11.8 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "March sales results were driven by strong performance in spring apparel categories such as shorts, tees, tanks, dresses, and swimwear.  The earlier Easter holiday this year also benefited March sales.  As a result, we now expect to achieve approximately a 5% comparable sales increase for the first quarter versus our earlier expectations of a 2%-4% comparable sales increase.  This would imply a March/April combined comparable sales increase of 5% to 6%."
On April 7, 2007, the Company operated 824 stores in 45 states, compared to 741 in 41 states at the same time last year.  
The Company celebrates the grand opening of ten new stores today, which includes its initial entry into Idaho.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, beginning at 8:30 AM EDT on Thursday, April 12.  The dial-in number for the replay is (719) 457-0820 (Pass Code:  2080436).
