For release: July 12, 2007 at 8:30 AM (DST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  July 12, 2007 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended July 7, 2007 increased 2.0 percent over the five-week period ended July 1, 2006. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 4.9 percent.  
For the 22 weeks ended July 7, 2007, total sales were up 10.7 percent over the 22 weeks ended July 1, 2006.  On a comparable store basis, sales for the 22-week period increased 3.0 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "As expected, June sales were negatively affected by the shift of Memorial Day into fiscal May.  We continue to expect July's sales to benefit from a calendar shift affecting our back-to-school business and our expectations are for July's comparable store sales to increase in the mid-single digit range."
The Company continues to expect its second quarter earnings per share to be $0.81 to $0.85 per diluted share.
On July 7, 2007, the Company operated 834 stores in 46 states, compared to 749 in 43 states at the same time last year.
