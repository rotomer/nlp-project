Management Raises FY 2007 Guidance
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  August 16/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported net sales and earnings for the second quarter ended August 4, 2007.
Kohl's Corporation second quarter earnings per diluted share increased 20.3 percent to $0.83 from $0.69 in last year's period.  Net income was $269.2 million compared with $232.4 million a year ago, an increase of 15.9 percent.  Net sales increased to $3.6 billion from $3.3 billion a year ago, an increase of 8.7 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales increased 1.3 percent for the same period.
For the six months ended August 4, 2007, net income increased 19.7 percent to $478.2 million or $1.48 per diluted share, compared to $399.6 million or $1.17 per diluted share for the six months ended July 29, 2006. Net sales increased 10.2 percent to $7.2 billion from $6.5 billion a year ago. Comparable store sales increased 2.5 percent for the same period.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "After a strong start to the quarter in May, our sales performance was affected by the performance of our seasonal businesses in June and July.  Strength in our other businesses remained consistent and our early read on back-to-school is positive.  We continue to achieve improvement in our operating margin in excess of both our short-term and long-range goals."
Montgomery added, "I am very proud of our associates and the role they played in delivering these results and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication to serving our customers.  They are the reason you can continue to expect great things' from Kohl's."
Earnings Guidance
The Company issued its initial guidance for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  Assuming a comparable sales increase of 2% to 4%, the Company would expect earnings per diluted share of $0.67 to $0.71 in the third quarter.  For the fourth quarter, assuming comparable sales of 1% to 3%, the Company would expect earnings per diluted share of $1.63 to $1.69.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $3.77 to $3.87 for fiscal 2007 versus its previous guidance of $3.75 to $3.87 per diluted share.
Expansion Update
During the first half of the 2007 fiscal year, the Company successfully opened 17 new stores, including its entry into the Idaho market with three stores.
