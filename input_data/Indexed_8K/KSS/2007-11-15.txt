Exhibit 99.1
National & Retail Trades and First Call, Release: November 15, 2007 at 4:00 PM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  November 15/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported net sales and earnings for the third quarter ended November 3, 2007.
Kohl's Corporation third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.61 in 2007 compared with $0.68 in last year's period.  Net income was $194.0 million compared with $224.5 million a year ago, a decrease of 13.6 percent.  Net sales increased to $3.8 billion from $3.7 billion a year ago, an increase of 4.8 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales decreased 2.6 percent for the same period.
For the nine months ended November 3, 2007, net income increased 7.7 percent to $672.2 million or $2.09 per diluted share, compared to $624.1 million or $1.85 per diluted share for the nine months ended October 28, 2006. Net sales increased 8.3 percent to $11.0 billion from $10.1 billion a year ago. Comparable store sales increased 0.7 percent for the same period.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our sales results reflected a difficult overall environment.  We continued to operate our business in a conservative manner, managing inventory investment as we continued our improvement in gross margin while reducing expenses where possible without hurting the customer's in-store experience."  
Montgomery added, "I am very proud of our associates and the role they played in delivering these results and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication to serving our customers.  They are the reason you can continue to expect great things' from Kohl's."
Earnings Guidance
For the fourth quarter, assuming comparable sales of flat to (2)%, the Company would expect earnings per diluted share of $1.45 to $1.51.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $3.52 to $3.58 for fiscal 2007 versus its previous guidance of $3.77 to $3.87 per diluted share. This would result in an increase of 6 percent to 8 percent over last year's $3.31 per diluted share.  
Expansion Update
During the month of September, the Company opened 80 new stores.  The Company operated 914 stores in 47 states as of November 3, 2007, compared with 814 stores in 45 states at the same time last year.
The Company opened 15 additional stores on November 11.  This completed the opening of 112 stores in fiscal 2007.
