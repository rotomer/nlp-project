Exhibit 99.1
National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: December 6, 2007 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis., -- (Business Wire)  December 6, 2007 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the four-week period ending December 1, 2007 increased 20.0 percent over the four-week period ending November 25, 2006. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 10.2 percent.  
For the 43 weeks ended December 1, 2007, total sales were up 9.9 percent while comparable store sales increased 2.0 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "November sales benefited from a calendar shift, as we expected.  Sales in weather-sensitive categories such as outerwear, fleece and cold weather accessories were very strong with the onset of more seasonable temperatures.  We continue to expect December's comparable sales to be negative mid to high single digits as a result of the shift.  Our comparable sales guidance for the quarter remains flat to (2) percent."
As of December 1, 2007, the Company operated 929 stores in 47 states, compared with 817 in 45 states at the same time last year.
