Comparable store sales decreased 11.4 percent on a reported basis.  As a reminder, last year's retail reporting calendar included 53 weeks.

Larry Montgomery, Kohl's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Customers' shopping patterns were driven by a search for value and they responded well to promotions closer to Christmas and post-holiday.  Our sales results reflected these deeper discounts, affecting our gross margin.  In addition, we have been aggressive in our clearance strategy to ensure we have the appropriate inventory content and level entering fiscal 2008.  As a result, we now expect our fourth quarter earnings to be $1.30 to $1.34 per diluted share."
