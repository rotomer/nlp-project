MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  February 7, 2008 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported sales for the fiscal periods ended February 2, 2008.
As a reminder, the January 2007 fiscal month consisted of 5 weeks, while the current year period was 4 weeks.  Total sales for the additional week in fiscal 2006 were approximately $200 million.  The following comparable store sales results compare the period ended February 2, 2008 to the period ended January 27, 2007.
Comparing the four weeks ended February 2, 2008 to the four weeks ended January 27, 2007, comparable store sales decreased 8.3 percent.  Total sales for the January fiscal month were approximately $800 million, down 20.4 percent from the same period a year ago.

For the year, total sales increased 5.6 percent over the same period a year ago while comparable store sales decreased 0.8 percent.  
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Customers continue to be selective in their purchases, driven by value and need.  Our inventory management strategy was successful and we will end the quarter with inventory below last year on a per store basis.  Based on January's sales results, we expect our earnings per share to be at the low end of our guidance of $1.30 to $1.34 per diluted share."
