National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: April 10, 2008 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  April 10, 2008 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the five-week period ended April 5, 2008 decreased 7.9 percent over the five-week period ended April 7, 2007. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 15.5 percent.  For the nine weeks ended April 5, 2008, total sales decreased 3.2 percent and comparable store sales decreased 11.1 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Sales in weather-sensitive businesses such as shorts,  tanks, polos and sandals experienced significant declines on a comparable store basis, contributing to our sales shortfall.  We have been conservative in our inventory planning and expense management and will continue to do so until the environment improves."
The Company now expects its first quarter comparable sales to be in the negative high-single digit range and its earnings to be $0.40 to $0.42 per diluted share.
On April 5, 2008, the Company operated 943 stores in 47 states, compared to 824 in 45 states at the same time last year.  
The Company celebrates the grand opening of fourteen new stores today.  The balance of its planned 70-75 stores for 2008 are expected to open in the third fiscal quarter, including its initial entry into the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale market.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:30 AM EDT on Thursday, April 10 until 8:30 PM EDT on Friday, April 11.  The toll-free dial-in number for the replay is (888) 360-2596. (No pass code is required.)
