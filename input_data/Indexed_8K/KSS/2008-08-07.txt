For release: August 7, 2008 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  August 7, 2008 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the four-week month ended August 2, 2008 decreased 2.4 percent from the four-week month ended August 4, 2007. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 10.4 percent.  
Total year-to-date sales were up 2.6 percent over the comparable prior year period.  On a comparable store basis, year-to-date sales decreased 5.6 percent.
Larry Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "
July was a month driven by clearance sales of spring and summer merchandise.   Our inventory levels in these clearance and transitional categories were significantly lower than last year, affecting sales results, but leading to improved gross margins.  We enter the fall season well-positioned and able to react quickly to any improvement in sales trends."
