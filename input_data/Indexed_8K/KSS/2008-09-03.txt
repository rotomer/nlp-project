For release: September 3, 2008 at 8:00 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  September 3, 2008 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that sales for the four-week month ended August 30, 2008 increased 2.6 percent from the four-week month ended September 1, 2007. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 5.8 percent.  
Total year-to-date sales were up 2.6 percent over the comparable prior year period.  On a comparable store basis, year-to-date sales decreased 5.6 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, "As expected, August was more difficult than our expectations of a 2 to 4 percent comparable sales decrease for the third quarter.  Some traditional back-to-school business such as footwear and children's performed well while other areas such as juniors and young men's were more challenging.  We continue to manage our inventory levels and expenses conservatively in this environment."
On August 30, 2008, the Company operated 957 stores in 47 states, compared to 834 in 46 states at the same time last year.  
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:00 AM EDT on Wednesday, September 3, until 8:00 PM EDT on Thursday, September 4.

The Company will be reporting September sales results on Wednesday, October 8, at 8:30 AM EDT due to the observance of Yom Kippur on the normal reporting day of Thursday, October 9.
