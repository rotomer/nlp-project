National & Retail Trades and First Call, Release: November 13, 2008 at 4:00 PM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  November 13/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended November 1, 2008.
Kohl's Corporation reported net income for the quarter ended November 1, 2008 of $160.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $194.0 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, a year ago.  Net sales were $3.8 billion, a decrease of 0.6 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 6.7 percent.
For the nine months ended November 1, 2008, net income decreased 18 percent to $549.1 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, compared to $672.2 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for the nine months ended November 3, 2007. Net sales increased 1.5 percent to $11.2 billion from $11.0 billion a year ago. Comparable store sales decreased 6.0 percent for the same period.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and CEO, said, "Our third quarter results reflect strong inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands, resulting in improved gross margins, as well as effective expense control.  We remain conservative in our sales expectations for the fourth quarter and will manage our business accordingly.  We expect the holiday season to be the most challenging in years and will be very competitive in order to gain market share.  We will use our financial strength to continue to invest in technology and talent in building for the future as we expand selectively and remodel existing stores in fiscal 2009."
Mansell added, "I am very proud of our 120,000 associates and the role they played in delivering these results in this environment and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication to serving our customers.  They are the reason you can continue to expect great things' from Kohl's."
Expansion Update
During the first nine months of 2008, Kohl's successfully opened 75 stores.  The Company ended the quarter with 1,004 stores in 48 states, compared with 914 stores in 47 states at the same time last year.  In fiscal 2009, the Company expects to open approximately 50 stores and remodel 60 stores.  
Earnings Guidance
For the fourth quarter, assuming comparable store sales of negative 8 percent to negative 12 percent, the Company would expect earnings per diluted share of $0.90 to $1.05 versus previous guidance of $1.26 to $1.34 per diluted share.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $2.69 to $2.84 for fiscal 2008.
