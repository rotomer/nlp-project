A.  
Amendments to Employment Agreements with R. Lawrence Montgomery, Kevin Mansell, Donald Brennan, Thomas Kingsbury and John Worthington
On November 17, 2008, Kohl's Department Stores, Inc., ("KDS") a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kohl's Corporation (the "Company"), entered into amendments to the employment agreements between KDS and each of R. Lawrence Montgomery, Kevin Mansell, Donald Brennan, Thomas Kingsbury and John Worthington.  These amendments:
(1)  Modify and amend certain terms of the employment agreements to ensure compliance with the United States Department of Treasury's final regulations issued pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code; and
 
(2)  Require each executive to execute a general release of all claims against KDS as a condition to the executive's receipt of any payments or other benefits after termination of the executive's employment.  
The foregoing description of the amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the employment agreement amendments, copies of which are attached as exhibits to this filing and incorporated herein by reference.
B.  
Corrective Stock Option Grant to R. Lawrence Montgomery  
On November 11, 2008, the Kohl's Corporation Board of Directors' Compensation Committee unanimously approved a corrective stock option grant of 250,000 non-qualified stock options (the "Corrective Options") to R. Lawrence Montgomery, effective November 17, 2008 (the "Grant Date").   This grant was made to compensate Mr. Montgomery for losses he suffered in April 2004 due to an administrative error by the Company's Human Resources staff.  At the time, it was Company policy that the Human Resources staff was responsible for keeping senior executive officers informed of upcoming option expiration dates and facilitating the exercise of those options.  As a result of incorrect information provided to Mr. Montgomery, 120,000 of Mr. Montgomery's vested, in-the-money stock options expired without his knowledge.  The expired options had an in-the-money market value of app roximately $5 million on the date they expired.  
The Corrective Options were granted pursuant to the Company's 2003 Long-Term Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The exercise price of the Corrective Options is $27.45 per share, which was the closing sale price of a share of the Company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Grant Date.  The Corrective Options will expire on November 17, 2015, regardless of whether Mr. Montgomery's employment terminates prior to that time.  The Corrective Options will vest in five equal installments on the first five anniversaries of the Grant Date, provided that, upon a termination of Mr. Montgomery's employment, the remaining unvested portion of the Corrective Options shall vest in equal installments on an annual basis over the period of time Mr. Montgomery is then contractually prohibited from engaging in
activities which are competitive with those of the Company.  Provided Mr. Montgomery does not violate his non-competition restriction, each installment of the remaining unvested portion of the Corrective Options shall vest on the anniversary of the date of termination of his employment until the end of the then-applicable non-competition period, provided that such period shall not extend beyond the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date.
 
 
The Corrective Options will vest immediately upon Mr. Montgomery's death or upon a change of control of the Company, as defined in the Plan.All other terms of the Corrective Options are consistent with the terms of the Plan.

Exhibit 99.5
Dear John:
We have entered into an employment agreement with you dated September 10, 2007 (the "Employment Agreement").  Certain provisions of the Employment Agreement are subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Under the final regulations issued by the Department of Treasury under Code Section 409A, all arrangements that are subject to Section 409A must be amended to comply with the final regulations on or before January 1, 2009.  Therefore, in order to comply with the final regulations under Section 409A, we are hereby amending your Employment Agreement, effective as of November 17, 2008 as follows:
1.
.  At the end of Section 2.2 of the Employment Agreement, the following language shall be added:
Timing of Fringe Benefits
"In no event will the reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement in one taxable year affect the amount of reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year, nor will Employee's right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  Further, any reimbursements to be provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid to the Employee no later than the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Employee incurs the expenses."
2.
.  The second sentence of Section 3.1(d) of the Employment Agreement shall be deleted and replaced with the following language:
Disability
"For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means the Employee (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company."
3.
.  A new Section 3.1(f) shall be inserted into the Employment Agreement, to read:
Separation From Service
"A termination of employment under this Agreement shall only occur to the extent Employee has a "separation from service" from Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  Under Section 409A, a "separation from service" occurs when the Employee and the Company reasonably anticipate that no further services will be performed by the Employee after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (whether as an employee or as a consultant) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed by the employee over the immediately preceding 36-month period."
4.
.  At the end of the second sentence of Section 3.2(d)(ii) of the Employment Agreement, the following language shall be added:
Timing of Payment of Severance Upon a Change of Control
", such Severance Payment to be paid to Employee in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the date of the Employee's termination, subject to Section 3.2(e) below."
5.
.  At the end of Section 3.2(d)(iv) of the Employment Agreement, the following language shall be added:
Timing of Payment of Health Insurance Continuation
"In no event will the Health Insurance Continuation to be provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement in one taxable year affect the amount of Health Insurance Continuation to be provided in any other taxable year, nor will Employee's right to Health Insurance Continuation be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit."
6.
.  A new sentence shall be inserted into the Employment Agreement at the end of Section 3.5(b), to read:
Timing of Gross-Up Payment
"Any Gross-Up Payment under this Agreement shall be paid to the Employee no later than the end of the Employee's taxable year following the calendar year in which the Excise Tax is remitted to the taxing authorities."
7.
.  A new Section 8.15 shall be inserted at the end of the Employment Agreement, to read:
Section 409A Compliance
"8.15
.  The Company and Employee intend that any amounts or benefits payable or provided under this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject Employee to the payment of the tax, interest and any tax penalty which may be imposed under Code Section 409A.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.  In furtherance thereof, to the extent that any
Section 409A Compliance
provision hereof would otherwise result in Employee being subject to payment of tax, interest and tax penalty under Code Section 409A, the Company and Employee agree to amend this Agreement in a manner that brings this Agreement into compliance with Code Section 409A and preserves to the maximum extent possible the economic value of the relevant payment or benefit under this Agreement to Employee.
8.
.  At the end of Section 3.4 of the Employment Agreement, the following language shall be added:
Release
"and, as an additional condition to the receipt of such amounts or benefits, Employee shall refuse to exercise any right to revoke such release agreement during any applicable rescission period."
The capitalized terms used above which are not otherwise defined in this letter will have the meanings assigned to them in the Employment Agreement.  Except as modified by this letter, the Employment Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning to the Company a copy of this letter.
