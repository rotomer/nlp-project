For release: December 4, 2008 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  December 4, 2008 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended November 29, 2008 decreased 13.7 percent from the four-week month ended December 1, 2007.  On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 17.5 percent.  
Total year-to-date sales decreased 0.9 percent over the comparable prior year period.  On a comparable store basis, year-to-date sales decreased 7.7 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, "November sales results were as expected, affected by both lower traffic than last year, and a significant sales shift due to a later Thanksgiving. Post-Thanksgiving results have been significantly stronger than our prior trend, driven by planned strong promotion. Consumers are focused on value, and we have incorporated that into our promotional efforts through the end of the year."
