National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: January 8, 2009 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  January 8, 2009 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the five-week month ended January 3, 2009 increased 3.6 percent over the five-week month ended January 5, 2008.  On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 1.4 percent.  
Total year-to-date sales decreased 0.1 percent from the comparable prior year period.  On a comparable store basis, year-to-date sales decreased 6.6 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, "December sales results were aided by last minute shoppers and strong post-Christmas business. Inventory levels, particularly seasonal clearance, are significantly below last year. Going forward, we intend to continue to plan sales and inventory conservatively in order to maximize profitability."
Given that January is heavily driven by end of season clearance, the Company's expectation for January comparable sales performance is a decrease of mid to high teens. The Company is comfortable with the First Call consensus of $0.98 per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter. Its previous guidance was $0.90 - $1.05 per diluted share.
As of January 3, 2009, the Company operated 1,004 stores in 48 states, compared to 929 in 47 states at the same time last year.  
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:30 AM EST on Thursday, January 8, until 8:30 PM EST on Friday, January 9.  The toll-free, dial-in number for the replay is (888) 360-2596. (No pass code is required.)
