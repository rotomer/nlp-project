Exhibit 99.1
National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: February 5, 2009 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) February 5, 2009 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended January 31, 2009 decreased 9.0 percent from the four-week month ended February 2, 2008.  On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 13.4 percent.  
Total sales for the year decreased 0.5 percent from the prior year.  On a comparable store basis, sales for the year decreased 6.9 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, "As expected, January sales results were impacted negatively by significantly lower seasonal clearance inventory levels. These lower levels were a result of improved inventory management and have positioned us positively for the transition to spring. We intend to continue to plan sales conservatively and flow receipts accordingly in 2009."
Given the better-than-expected January sales and continued strong inventory and expense management, the Company now expects to exceed the current First Call consensus of $0.99 per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter.
As of January 31, 2009, the Company operated 1,004 stores in 48 states, compared to 929 in 47 states at the same time last year.
