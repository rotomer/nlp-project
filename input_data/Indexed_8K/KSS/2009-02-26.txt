National & Retail Trades and First Call, Release: February 26, 2009 at 4:00 PM (EST)
Q4 Reported EPS of $1.10 and Fiscal 2008 of $2.89, Exceeding First Call Consensus Estimate
Full Year Free Cash Flow of $687 Million
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  February 26/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter and year ended January 31, 2009.
Kohl's Corporation reported net income for the quarter ended January 31, 2009 of $336 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared with $412 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, a year ago.  Net sales were $5.2 billion, a decrease of 4.6 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 9.1 percent.
For the twelve months ended January 31, 2009, net income was $885 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1,084 million, or $3.39 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended February 2, 2008. Net sales decreased 0.5 percent to $16.4 billion from $16.5 billion a year ago. Comparable store sales decreased 6.9 percent for the same period.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and CEO, said, "Despite the sales results, we delivered improved merchandise margins through strong inventory management and successful exclusive brand strategies. We also managed expenses well while improving our store experience. I am very proud of our 126,000 associates and the role they played in these results and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication in delivering on our promise to " expect great things" from Kohl's
."
Mansell added, "We expect 2009 to be just as challenging from a macro-economic perspective.  We are planning conservatively in our sales expectations, inventory levels and expenses.  We will be very competitive in order to gain market share in this environment.  We will continue to invest prudently in stores, both new and remodeled, technology and talent to ensure our profitable growth in the long run."
 
Expansion Update
During 2008, Kohl's successfully opened 75 stores.  The Company ended the year with 1,004 stores in 48 states, compared with 929 stores in 47 states at the same time last year.  In fiscal 2009, the Company expects to open approximately 55 stores and remodel 51 stores.  
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which the Company defines as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.   Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations.  The Company believes that free cash flow represents its ability to generate additional cash flow from its business operations.  
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, for the year ended January 31, 2009.
Earnings Guidance
The Company issued its initial guidance for fiscal 2009.  Based on assumptions of a total sales decrease of 1% to 4% and a comparable store sales decrease of 5% to 8%, the Company expects earnings per diluted share of $2.00 to $2.30 for the year.  For the first fiscal quarter, the Company expects earnings per diluted share of $0.27 to $0.34 based on an assumption of a  comparable store sales decrease of 5% to 8%.
