National & Retail Trades and First Call
For release: March 5, 2009 at 8:30 AM (EST)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) March 5, 2009 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended February 28, 2009 increased 3.6 percent from the four-week month ended March 1, 2008.  On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 1.6 percent.  
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, "February's sales results exceeded our expectations as regular price selling offset significantly lower levels of clearance sales. Although we are pleased with the results, we intend to continue to plan sales conservatively and flow receipts accordingly in 2009."
As of February 28, 2009, the Company operated 1,004 stores in 48 states, compared to 929 in 47 states at the same time last year.
