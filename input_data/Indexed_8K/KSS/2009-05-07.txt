For release: May 7, 2009 at 8:30 AM (EDT)
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire)  May 7, 2009 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended May 2, 2009 decreased 2.3 percent from the four-week month ended May 3, 2008.  On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 6.2 percent.  
For the quarter and year-to-date period, total sales increased 0.4 percent and comparable store sales decreased 4.2 percent.  
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, commented, Sales results for April exceeded our expectations.  Childrens outperformed the Company from a line-of-business perspective and the Southwest was our strongest performing region. As a result of our sales results and inventory management initiatives, our gross margin for the quarter was stronger than planned and our expenses remained well controlled.  We now expect earnings of $0.43 to $0.44 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, exceeding our previous guidance of $0.27 to $0.34 per diluted share."
