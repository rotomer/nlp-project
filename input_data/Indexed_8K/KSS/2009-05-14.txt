Exhibit 99.1
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  May 14/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter ended May 2, 2009.
First Quarter Results
Kohl's Corporation reported net income for the quarter ended May 2, 2009 of $137 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with $153 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, a year ago.  Net sales were $3.6 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 4.2 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's president and chief executive officer, said, "We achieved our goal of gaining market share through our performance in both comparable and total sales in the first quarter.  Our merchandise margins improved through strong inventory management and successful exclusive brand strategies. We also managed expenses well while improving our store experience. We continue to expect 2009 to be challenging from a macro-economic perspective and, therefore, remain conservative in our sales expectations, inventory levels and expenses.  We are focused on gaining market share in this difficult environment."
Mansell added, "I am very proud of our 121,000 associates and the role they played in these results and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication in delivering on our promise to " expect great things" from Kohl's  
."
