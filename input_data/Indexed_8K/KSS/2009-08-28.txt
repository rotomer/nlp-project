of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
As previously announced, Kevin Mansell has been named Chairman of the Board of Kohl's Corporation (the "Company") effective September 1, 2009.  Mr. Mansell will also continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  With Mr. Mansell's appointment, R. Lawrence Montomery will retire from his position as Chairman of the Board effective September 1, 2009, but will continue to be employed by the Company and serve on the Board of Directors until January 30, 2010.
In connection with his promotion, Mr. Mansell will receive an increase in his base salary to $1,300,000, as well as a grant of 50,000 shares of restricted stock effective October 15, 2009.  The restricted stock will vest in five equal installments on the first through fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
In connection with his retirement, the Company has entered into a NonCompetition and Consulting Agreement with Mr. Montgomery effective September 1, 2009.  The agreement contains the following terms:
Following his retirement, Mr. Montgomery will be subject to a five-year noncompetition agreement, effectively extending the term of his current noncompetition agreement from two years to five years.  
Mr. Montgomery will perform specified consulting services for the first three years following his retirement, through January 30, 2013; and
In consideration for his agreement not to compete and his consulting services, Mr. Montgomery will receive payments of $750,000 per year for the first three years of the term of the agreement, and $375,000 for each of the fourth and fifth years of the agreement term.
The Company has also entered into amended and restated Employment Agreements with each of Mr. Mansell, Donald Brennan and John Worthington effective September 1, 2009.
Under their prior employment agreements, Messrs. Mansell, Brennan and Worthington had been entitled to a gross-up payment in the event that any amounts payable to them in connection with a change of control would have been subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.  This gross up has been eliminated in the amended and restated agreements.
Each of the amended and restated agreements is otherwise substantially similar to the form of employment agreement to which Messrs. Brennan and Worthington were previously party, except for certain updates and modifications, including a modification to the amounts payable to the executives upon a termination without cause or for good reason:
Mr. Mansell's amended and restated agreement eliminates the cash payment based on the average value of stock awards made over the three years prior to
termination and provides for continued or accelerated vesting of equity awards for the remaining term of the agreement following termination.  
Mr. Brennan's and Mr. Worthington's amended and restated agreements eliminate the payment of salary over the remaining term of the agreement following a termination that is not in connection with a change of control and provide for a payment equal to their then-current salary for the remaining term of the agreement plus an amount equal to the average bonus for the prior three fiscal years.
The foregoing descriptions of the Noncompetition and Consulting Agreement and the Amended and Restated Employment Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are attached as exhibits to this filing and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1

st
The Company and Executive entered into an employment agreement dated as of February 1, 1999 (the "Original Agreement"), whereby Company and Executive agreed to certain aspects of their relationship during and after the period in which Executive is employed by the Company;
The parties believe it is in their best interests to amend and restate the Original Agreement as set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements and covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the Company and Executive ("Parties"), the Parties agree as follows:
1.1
.  The Company employs Executive, and Executive accepts employment by the Company, for the three (3) year period commencing on September 1, 2009 (the "Initial Term"), subject to earlier termination as hereinafter set forth in Article III, below.  This Agreement shall be automatically extended for one (1) day each day during the term (the Initial Term as so extended, the "Renewal Term") unless either party shall give the other a written notice of intention not to renew, in which case this Agreement shall terminate as of the end of the Initial Term or said Renewal Term, as applicable or unless this Agreement is earlier terminated as set forth in Article III, below.  If this Agreement is extended, the terms of this Agreement during such Renewal Term shall be the same as the terms in effect immediately prior to such extension (including the early termination provisions set forth in Article III, below), subject to any such changes or modifications as mutually may be agreed between the parties as evidenced in a written instrument signed by both the Company and Executive.  If Executive's employment is terminated for any reason specified in Section 3.1, below, after either party has provided a notice of non-renewal under this Section 1.1, such termination will be treated as a termination under the applicable provision of Section 3.1 and not as a termination due to non-renewal under this Section 1.1.

In no event will the Health Insurance Continuation to be provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement in one taxable year affect the amount of Health Insurance Continuation to be provided in any other taxable year, nor will Executive's right to Health Insurance Continuation be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 (f)
.  If amounts paid to Executive pursuant to any Subsection of Section 3.2 would be subject to a penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code because Executive is a "specified employee" within the

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company may deduct from any Severance Payment Executive receives pursuant to this Agreement, amounts that Executive is responsible to pay for Health Insurance Continuation.  Any Health Insurance Continuation provided for herein will cease on the date on which Executive becomes eligible for health insurance coverage under anot her employer's group health insurance plan, and, within five (5) calendar days of Executive becoming eligible for health insurance coverage under another employer's group health insurance plan, Executive agrees to inform the Company of such fact in writing.

(e)
.  If amounts paid to Executive pursuant to any Subsection of Section 3.2 would be subject to a penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code because Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), such payments will be delayed until a date which is six (6) months after Executive's termination of employment, at which point any such delayed payments will be paid to Executive in a lump sum.  Further, to the extent amount any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to any Subsection of Section 3.2 are determined, after consultation with Company counsel, to be required to be paid in accordance with the payment terms under the Original Agreement in order for Executive to avoid penalties under Section 409A, such amounts shall be payable in accordance with the payment terms under the Original Agreem ent.  Any amounts required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Original Agreement as described in the prior sentence shall accrue interest at the rate applicable to 5-year United States Treasury notes as of the effective date of termination during the period the payments are unpaid and such interest shall be paid by the Company to the Executive together with each installment payment.  In no event, however, shall the total amount payable to Executive under any Subsection of this Section 3.2 be subject to the offset described in the Original Agreement for compensation earned or received by Executive from other sources.

(e)
.  If amounts paid to Executive pursuant to any Subsection of Section 3.2 would be subject to a penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code because Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), such payments will be delayed until a date which is six (6) months after Executive's termination of employment, at which point any such delayed payments will be paid to Executive in a lump sum.  Further, to the extent amount any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to any Subsection of Section 3.2 are determined, after consultation with Company counsel, to be required to be paid in accordance with the payment terms under the Original Agreement in order for Executive to avoid penalties under Section 409A, such amounts shall be payable in accordance with the payment terms under the Original Agreem ent.  Any amounts required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Original Agreement as described in the prior sentence shall accrue interest at the rate applicable to 5-year United States Treasury notes as of the effective date of termination during the period the payments are unpaid and such interest shall be paid by the Company to the Executive together with each installment payment.
