99.1         Press Release dated September 3, 2009

MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - September 3, 2009 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended August 29, 2009 increased 4.8 percent from the four-week month ended August 30, 2008. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 0.2 percent.
For the year-to-date period, total sales increased 1.8 percent and comparable store sales decreased 2.7 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "
Our August results were driven by improvement across most businesses with Accessories being the strongest and Women's being the most improved. On a regional basis, the Southeast and South-Central benefited from a later tax-free event this year and were the most improved regions, while the Southwest continued to lead in overall performance with a double-digit comparable store sales increase.
We believe this momentum will continue as we open 37 new stores later this month, mostly in former Mervyn's locations, which will put us in a stronger position to be the retailer of choice in the Southwest region, particularly in California."
As of August 29, 2009, the Company operated 1,022 stores in 49 states, compared to 957 stores in 47 states at the same time last year.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:30 AM EDT on Thursday, September 3, 2009, until 8:30 PM EDT on Friday, September 4, 2009.
