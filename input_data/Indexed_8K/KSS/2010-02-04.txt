MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - February 4, 2010 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended January 30, 2010 increased 10.7 percent from the four-week month ended January 31, 2009.

Total sales for the year increased 4.8 percent from the prior year. On a comparable store basis, sales for the year increased 0.4 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Our January sales results reflect continued consistency as all of our lines of business and all regions once again achieved positive comparable sales increases.
