For the year-to-date period, total sales increased 9.6 percent and comparable store sales increased 6.2 percent.

From a regional perspective, the West and Southeast regions continued their strong year-to-date trends. The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions benefited from favorable weather and also outperformed the company.
