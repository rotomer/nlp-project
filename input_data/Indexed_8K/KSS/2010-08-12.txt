Exhibit 99.1
Announces New Credit Card Agreement
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  August 12/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2010.
Kohl's Corporation reported net income for the quarter ended July 31, 2010 of $260 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $229 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, a year ago.  Net sales were $4.1 billion, an increase of 7.7 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 4.6 percent.  
For the six months ended July 31, 2010, net income increased 25 percent to $459 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, compared to $368 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for the six months ended August 1, 2009.  Net sales increased 9.3 percent to $8.1 billion from $7.4 billion a year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 5.9 percent for the same period.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter.  We continue to gain market share as reflected in our performance in both comparable and total sales growth. This sales performance, along with strong inventory management, allowed us to continue to increase our gross margin rate.  
We are particularly pleased by our leverage in store payroll and marketing which offset our important long-term investment in e-commerce in the second quarter and resulted in us delivering a better overall expense result. "
Earnings Guidance
For the third quarter, the Company expects total sales to increase between 4.5 and 6.5 percent; comparable store sales to increase 2 to 4 percent; and gross margin as a percent of sales to increase 20 to 40 basis points over last year.  The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase between 10 and 11 percent.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $0.57 to $0.63 for the third quarter.  
For the fourth quarter, the Company expects total sales to increase between 4.5 and 6.5 percent; comparable store sales to increase 2 to 4 percent; and gross margin as a percent of sales to increase 20 to 40 basis points over last year.  The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase between 3 and 4 percent.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $1.51 to $1.59 for the fourth quarter.  
The Company's updated guidance for fiscal 2010 is $3.57 to $3.70 per diluted share.
The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K today pertaining to a new credit card agreement and will discuss additional details on its earnings conference call this morning.
