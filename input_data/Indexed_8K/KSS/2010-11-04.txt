MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - November 4, 2010 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended October 30, 2010 were 1.0 percent lower than the four-week month ended October 31, 2009. On a comparable store basis, October sales decreased 2.5 percent. For the quarter, total sales increased 4.1 percent and comparable store sales increased 1.8 percent. Year to date, total sales increased 7.4 percent and comparable store sales increased 4.4 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Strong performance in the second half of the month partially offset lower sales in the first two weeks of the month due to unseasonable weather. The West region reported the strongest results for the month. The Footwear business again reported the strongest comparable store sales. Our E-Commerce business continues to report strong growth."
The Company expects third quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.57 to $0.58, consistent with the low end of its previous guidance of $0.57 - $0.63 per diluted share. Included in this guidance is an accounting correction resulting from recently identified errors in the Company's
accounting for leased properties. As a result of a detailed review of its historical accounting, the Company expects to record adjustments to depreciation, interest and rent expense during the third quarter. Though the Company has not completed its review, it currently expects a correction of up to $25 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. The errors occurred over a number of years and are not material to any previously reported period.
The Company operates 1,089 stores in 49 states, compared to 1,059 stores at the same time last year.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:30 AM EDT on Thursday, November 4, until 8:30 PM EDT on Friday, November 5, 2010.
