Exhibit 99.1
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  November 10/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter and nine months ended October 30, 2010.
Kohl's Corporation reported net income for the quarter ended October 30, 2010 of $194 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared with $193 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, a year ago.  For the nine months ended October 30, 2010, net income increased 16 percent to $652 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared to $560 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, for the nine months ended October 31, 2009. These results exclude the lease accounting corrections which are more fully described below.  
Net sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion, an increase of 4.1 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 1.8 percent.  Year to date, net sales increased 7.4 percent to $12.4 billion compared to $11.5 billion a year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 4.4 percent for the same period.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said "We are pleased with our financial results for the third quarter.  We continue to gain market share as reflected in our performance in both comparable and total sales growth. This sales performance, along with strong inventory management, allowed us to continue to increase our gross margin rate.  We are pleased with the expense management discipline across the company that allowed us to grow our expenses less than we originally planned."
As previously disclosed, as a result of a detailed review of its historical accounting for its leased properties, the Company expects to record non-cash adjustments which are expected to increase depreciation, interest and rent expense for the third quarter.  Though the Company has not completed its review, based largely on the average adjustment required for leases that have been reviewed to date, management currently expects a correction in the range of $25 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, to $75 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.  The errors occurred over a number of years.  Upon finalization of its review, the Company will quantify the impact of the corrections on previously reported periods.  
The Company expects the accounting review to be complete before filing its third quarter 10-Q.
Earnings Guidance
For the fourth quarter, the Company expects total sales to increase between 4.5 and 6.5 percent; comparable store sales to increase 2 to 4 percent; and gross margin as a percent of sales to increase 20 to 40 basis points over last year.  The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase between 3 and 4 percent.  This would result in earnings per diluted share of $1.51 to $1.59 for the fourth quarter.  
Resumption of Share Repurchase Program
Kohl's intends to enter into an agreement within the next several weeks to repurchase $1 billion of its common stock on an accelerated basis.  These shares would be purchased under the $2.5 billion share repurchase program announced in September 2007, pursuant to which $1.9 billion of authorization remains.  Kohl's entry into this repurchase agreement is contingent on, among other things, market conditions and on Kohl's not possessing material non-public information on the commencement date.
