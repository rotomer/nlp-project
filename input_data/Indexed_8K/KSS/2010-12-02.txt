MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - December 2, 2010 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended November 27, 2010 increased 8.1 percent over the four-week month ended November 28, 2009. On a comparable store basis, November sales increased 6.1 percent. Year to date, total sales increased 7.5 percent and comparable store sales increased 4.7 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased with our sales performance in November, given it comes on top of last year's 3.3 percent comparable store sales increase. The Southeast and South-Central regions outperformed the company. From a line-of-business perspective, the Footwear business once again reported the strongest comparable store sales for the month, while Mens and Womens also outperformed the company."
The Company has substantially completed the detailed review of its historical accounting for leased properties as discussed in its November 10, 2010 press release. The Company expects the final adjustment to decrease third quarter income before taxes by approximately $50 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10, which is within the range of management's previous estimate of $25 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, to $75 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Additionally, the Company has determined that the corrections are not material to any previously reported period.
The Company operates 1,089 stores in 49 states, compared to 1,059 stores at the same time last year.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available for 36 hours, from 8:30 AM EST on Thursday, December 2, until 8:30 PM EST on Friday, December 3, 2010.
