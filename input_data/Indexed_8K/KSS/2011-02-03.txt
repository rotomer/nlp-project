MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - February 3, 2011 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that total sales for the four-week month ended January 29, 2011 increased 3.4 percent over the four-week month ended January 30, 2010. On a comparable store basis, January sales increased 1.4 percent. For the full year, total sales increased 7.1 percent and comparable store sales increased 4.4 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "January's sales results benefitted from continued strength in our e-commerce business as sales increased 60 percent over last year. The Midwest region reported the strongest comp sales for the month on a regional basis, with the Northeast region being most affected by snowstorms during the month. From a line-of-business perspective, Men's and Home outperformed the company on a comparable store sales basis."
As a result of its January performance, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.66 for the fourth quarter and $3.64 to $3.65 for fiscal 2010 versus its previous guidance of $1.62 to $1.66 for the fourth quarter and $3.61 to $3.65 for fiscal 2010.
