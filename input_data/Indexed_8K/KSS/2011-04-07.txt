MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - April 7, 2011 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that for the five-week month ended April 2, 2011 total sales decreased 4.9 percent and comparable store sales decreased 6.5 percent from the five-week month ended April 3, 2010.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "As expected, we reported a decrease in comparable store sales in March due to the timing of Easter. From a line of business perspective, Accessories, Home, Men's and Women's outperformed the company average. Children's and Footwear, which are most sensitive to the Easter shift, reported the highest decrease in comparable sales. The Southeast and South Central regions reported the strongest comparable sales results for the month."
