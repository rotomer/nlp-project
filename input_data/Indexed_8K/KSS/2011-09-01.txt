MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - September 1, 2011 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that for the four-week month ended August 27, 2011 total sales decreased 0.1 percent and comparable store sales decreased 1.9 percent from the four-week month ended August 28, 2010. Year to date, total sales increased 2.9 percent and comparable store sales increased 1.1 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Our August comp sales results were mainly driven by lower customer traffic. We are aggressively increasing our marketing as well as sharpening our pricing focus for the remainder of the fall season to reverse this trend. We are optimistic that these steps, combined with the excitement surrounding the Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony launches later this month, will have a favorable impact on our sales for the remainder of the year."
The Company operates 1,097 stores in 49 states, compared to 1,067 stores at the same time last year.
