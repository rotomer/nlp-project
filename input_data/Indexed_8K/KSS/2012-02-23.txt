MENOMONEE FALLS, WI (Business Wire)  February 23, 2012 - Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS) today reported results for the quarter and year ended January 28, 2012.
Fourth Quarter Results
Kohl's Corporation reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.81.  Net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $455 million, compared to $494 million ($1.66 per diluted share) a year ago.

Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased that 2011 was another year of profitability and earnings per share growth for our shareholders.  With the commitment of each of our 140,000 associates, we were able to navigate a difficult holiday sales season through strong expense and inventory management.  We achieved a major milestone in 2011 with our E-Commerce business reporting $1 billion in revenues. We are starting 2012 with considerable brand excitement, with the launch of Rock and Republic, continued excitement from our Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony brands, and expansion of the successful ELLE and Simply Vera Vera Wang brands into new categories."
The Company increased its free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) by 27% to $1.1 billion and returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders in 2011 with its first-ever dividend and share repurchases.

Free Cash Flow  
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less acquisition of property & equipment and capital lease & financing obligation payments.   Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations.  We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.  
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2011.
