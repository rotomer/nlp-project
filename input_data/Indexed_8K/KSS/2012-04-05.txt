MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - April 5, 2012 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that for the five-week month ended March 31, 2012 total sales increased 5.3 percent and comparable store sales increased 3.6 percent over the five-week month ended April 2, 2011. Year to date, total sales have increased 3.6 percent and comparable store sales have increased 1.8 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Warmer weather and an earlier Easter combined to help improve our sales trend, especially in certain regions and businesses. The cold weather regions - Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast - outperformed the company. Children's apparel, driven by Easter demand, was the strongest business while men's and women's apparel also performed well."
The Company opened 9 new stores, including one relocated store, and closed one store in March 2012 and now operates 1,134 stores in 49 states, compared to 1,097 stores at the same time last year.
Comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available from 8:30 AM ET on Thursday, April 5, 2012 until 8:30 PM ET on Friday, April 6, 2012.
