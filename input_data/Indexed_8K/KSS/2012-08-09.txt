MENOMONEE FALLS, WI  August 9/BUSINESS WIRE/Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS). Kohl's Corporation today reported results for the quarter ended July 28, 2012.
Kohl's Corporation reported second quarter net income of $240 million ($1.00 per diluted share) compared to $299 million ($1.08 per diluted share) a year ago.  Net sales were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 1.0 percent for the quarter.  Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 2.7 percent.

We accomplished our goal of improving inventory levels for the fall season and our sales improved considerably in July as units were received.  As we look forward to the fall season, we are excited about the fashion content and level of newness in our assortments."
