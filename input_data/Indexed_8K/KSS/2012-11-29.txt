KOHL'S CORPORATION REPORTS NOVEMBER COMPARABLE STORE SALES
MENOMONEE FALLS, WI, -- (Business Wire) - November 29, 2012 -- Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) reported today that for the four-week month ended November 24, 2012 total sales decreased 4.9 percent and comparable store sales decreased 5.6 percent from the four-week month ended November 26, 2011. Year to date, total sales increased 0.4 percent and comparable store sales decreased 1.1 percent.
Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Though November sales were lower than expectations, we are encouraged by improved sales over the Thanksgiving week. There was a significant shift in Black Friday-related sales into our E-Commerce channel. For the week, both transactions and sales in E-Commerce increased over 50 percent with most of these sales being recognized in December. The combination of these E-Commerce sales and our store sales resulted in higher sales for the last week of the month."
All regions reported negative sales for the month. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging regions due to weak sales early in the month following Superstorm Sandy. Children's was the strongest line of business. Additional comments regarding the Company's sales results will be provided in a pre-recorded telephone message, which will be available from 8:30 am ET on Thursday, November 29, 2012 until 8:30 pm ET on Friday, November 30, 2012.
