Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Peter W. Keegan Senior Vice President (212) 521-2950 Candace Leeds V.P. of Public Affairs (212) 521-2416 Joshua E. Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS ------------------------- NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 ----------------------------------------- NEW YORK, August 7, 2003-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2003 second quarter of $214.8 million, compared to $198.8 million for the second quarter of 2002. The following table summarizes the revenues, net income and earnings per share information: (a) Restated to reflect an adjustment to the Company's historical accounting for CNA's investment in life settlement contracts and the related revenue recognition. The impact of this adjustment on operating results in 2002 was insignificant. (b) Revenue includes premiums of $535.0 and $1,151.0 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2002, related to the National Postal Mail Handlers contract at CNA which was transferred on July 1, 2002. (c) The Company has two classes of common stock, Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock, issued in February 2002. Page 1 of 7 Consolidated net income in the second quarter of 2003 includes net investment gains of $250.7 million, compared to losses of $117.9 million in the second quarter of 2002. Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the second quarter of 2003 amounted to $189.8 million or $1.02 per share, compared to $157.4 million or $0.84 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income in the second quarter of 2003 includes net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock of $251.0 million, compared to losses of $119.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, included $277.3 million (after tax and minority interest) of unfavorable net prior year reserve development in CNA's property and casualty segment, of which approximately 80% relates to accident year 2000 and prior. The significant unfavorable net prior year premium and loss development was recorded primarily for workers compensation, directors and officers coverages, and a recent adverse arbitration decision involving a single large property and business interruption loss that occurred in 1995. The results also included an increase in the bad debt reserves for reinsurance and insurance receivables, catastrophe losses for the Texas tornados and Midwest rain storms and decreased net investment income. These adverse items were more than offset by increased net investment gains and strong current accident year results. Results for the quarter were also impacted by lower net income from Lorillard due to an increase in sales promotion expenses and lower total sales unit volume. Net investment gains increased $368.6 million (after tax and minority interest) in the second quarter of 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002. This increase was due primarily to increased gains on sales of fixed maturity securities and a decrease in investment related impairment charges in the second quarter of 2003. Investment related impairment losses (after tax and minority interest) were $18.0 million for the second quarter of 2003 as compared with $169.2 million for the same period in 2002. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the second quarter of 2003 was $25.0 million or $0.63 per Carolina Group share, compared to $41.4 million, or $1.03 per Carolina Group share in the second quarter of 2002. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the actual and pro forma results of the Carolina Group for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. Six Months Ended June 30, 2003 Compared With 2002 - ------------------------------------------------- Net income for the first half of 2002 included a loss from discontinued operations at CNA of $31.0 million or $0.16 per share of Loews common stock and a charge for accounting changes of $39.6 million or $0.21 per share of Loews common stock, related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets at CNA. Consolidated income from continuing operations for the first half of 2003 was $404.8 million, compared to $482.2 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Income from continuing operations includes net investment gains of $194.1 million (after tax and minority interest), compared to a loss of $102.1 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The lower results reflect the unfavorable net prior year premium and loss development recorded in the second quarter of 2003 for the property and casualty segment as discussed above and the lower results from Lorillard, partially offset by the improvement in net investment gains. Page 2 of 7 Income from continuing operations attributable to Loews common stock for the first half of 2003 amounted to $351.2 million or $1.89 per share, compared to $422.8 million or $2.23 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Income from continuing operations includes net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock of $194.4 million, compared to losses of $103.6 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the first half of 2003 amounted to $53.6 million or $1.34 per Carolina Group share, compared to $59.4 million or $1.48 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Components of Net Income - ------------------------ (a) In the first quarter of 2002, CNA sold its life operations in Chile. (b) Represents the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which was a change in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets at CNA. Third Quarter Reserve Reviews - ----------------------------- Adverse trends in both asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort claims ("APMT") and non-APMT property and casualty segments continue to impact the property and casualty insurance industry. CNA reviews its property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves ("reserves") on a regular basis, and as part of these reviews, has noted an increase in reported construction defect claims. CNA expects to complete a comprehensive reserve review of construction defect exposures in the third quarter of 2003. In addition, other volatile exposures will also be reviewed on a comprehensive basis in the third quarter. While CNA continues to monitor and evaluate its APMT exposures on a regular basis, the completion of a comprehensive ground up analysis of its APMT exposures, previously scheduled for the second quarter, will be completed in the third quarter of 2003. Significant resources were dedicated to the proposed national asbestos reform legislation and to support the regulatory reviews described below. As such, CNA plans to complete its more formal and comprehensive analysis in the third quarter of 2003. In addition, in connection with routine state regulatory exams of Continental Casualty Company ("CCC") and Continental Insurance Company ("CIC"), an independent actuarial firm is in the process of reviewing CNA's reserves as of December 31, 2001. CNA intends to have the independent actuarial firm update its review to include an assessment of its December 31, Page 3 of 7 2002 reserves using more recent data. These independent reviews are expected to be completed by December 31, 2003. CNA will consider the results of these independent actuarial reviews in the reserving process. While management believes that CNA's reserves as of June 30, 2003 are appropriate based on information known at this time, CNA, as a result of the third quarter reviews by CNA and the independent actuarial firm and other factors deemed relevant by CNA, may in the future determine that its recorded reserves are not sufficient and may increase its reserves by amounts that may be material, which could adversely affect CNA's business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings and the Company's results of operations and equity. Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. # # # At June 30, 2003, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $66.96 per Loews common share compared to $61.68 per Loews common share at December 31, 2002. At June 30, 2003, there were 185,447,050 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 39,910,000 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries', outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In February 2002 the Company created a class of common stock, called Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Company's assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. In an initial public offering, the Company issued shares of Carolina Group Stock representing an interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group. Loews common stock represents the economic performance of the Company's remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group Stock. At June 30, 2003, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 23.01% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.

Net sales for the Carolina Group were $780.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $1,026.9 million in 2002. The decline in net sales reflects lower unit sales volume of 5.7% and increased sales promotion expenses. Carolina Group net income for the first half of 2003 was $232.8 million, compared to $329.5 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income for 2003 was reduced by after-tax charges of $16.8 million in the second quarter and $17.1 million in the first quarter to settle litigation with tobacco growers and to resolve indemnification claims and trademark matters in connection with the 1977 sale by Lorillard of its international business.
