Parker, 312/822-5167 CNA ANNOUNCES EXIT FROM ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS AND SALE OF ASSUMED REINSURANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TO FOLKSAMERICA CHICAGO, October 3, 2003 --- Today, CNA Financial Corporation (NYSE: CNA) announced that it agreed to sell the renewal rights for most of the treaty business of CNA Re, its assumed reinsurance business unit, to Folksamerica Reinsurance Company (Folksamerica). Concurrently with the sale, CNA will be withdrawing from the assumed reinsurance business and will manage the run-off of its retained liabilities. "Today's announcement allows CNA to concentrate its property and casualty capabilities on its primary operations. CNA Re, which expects to write approximately $600 million of premium in 2003, has done an outstanding job building a profitable book of reinsurance business," said Stephen W. Lilienthal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CNA insurance companies. "We are pleased that we found a high quality partner to purchase the renewal rights to this book of business." Folksamerica, a leading U.S. reinsurance company, ranks among the top four broker market reinsurers. Folksamerica is a wholly owned subsidiary of White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. of Hamilton, Bermuda. White Mountains is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WTM." Under the terms of the transaction, Folksamerica will compensate CNA based upon the amount of premiums renewed by Folksamerica over the next two contract renewals. In addition, Folksamerica has indicated its intention to offer employment to a number of CNA Re's staff.
