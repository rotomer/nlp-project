Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Peter W. Keegan Senior Vice President (212) 521-2950 Candace Leeds V.P. of Public Affairs (212) 521-2416 Joshua E. Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS ------------------------- RESULTS FOR 2003 ---------------- NEW YORK, February 12, 2004-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2003 fourth quarter of $367.4 million, compared to $261.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003 amounted to $610.7 million, compared to net income of $912.0 million in 2002. The following table summarizes the revenues, net income (loss) and earnings per share information: (a) Revenue includes premiums of $1,151.0 for the year ended December 31, 2002, related to the National Postal Mail Handlers contract at CNA which was transferred on July 1, 2002. (b) The Company has two classes of common stock, Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock, issued in February 2002. Page 1 of 7 Quarter Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With 2002 - -------------------------------------------------- Consolidated income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $367.4 million, compared to $259.5 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Income from continuing operations includes net investment gains of $37.7 million (after tax and minority interest), compared to net investment losses of $23.7 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. Income from continuing operations attributable to Loews common stock for the fourth quarter of 2003 amounted to $332.6 million or $1.79 per share, compared to $222.6 million or $1.20 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003 includes net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock of $37.5 million, compared to net investment losses of $24.2 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net investment gains increased $61.7 million (after tax and minority interest) in the fourth quarter of 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002. This increase was due primarily to a decrease in investment related impairment charges for other-than-temporary declines in market values of fixed maturity and equity securities recorded in 2002, partially offset by a loss of $116.4 million (after tax and minority interest) from CNA's sale of its Group Benefits business to Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Investment related impairment losses were $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $208.8 million (after tax and minority interest) for the same period in 2002. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $34.8 million or $0.74 per Carolina Group share, compared to $36.9 million, or $0.92 per Carolina Group share in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the actual and pro forma results of the Carolina Group for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With 2002 - ----------------------------------------------- Net loss of $610.7 million for 2003 includes a gain from discontinued operations of $55.4 million or $0.30 per share of Loews common stock related to the sale of a hotel property, as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $27.0 million or $0.14 per share of Loews common stock in the prior year primarily related to CNA's sale of its life operations in Chile. Net income in 2002 also included a charge for accounting changes of $39.6 million or $0.21 per share of Loews common stock, related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets at CNA. The 2003 results reflect the charges at CNA Financial Corporation, the Company's 90% owned subsidiary, for net prior year development of $1,667.4 million, net of tax and minority interest, which includes premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development. Results for 2003 also include charges to increase bad debt reserves for insurance and reinsurance receivables of $356.9 million. Page 2 of 7 The net prior year development consists of $1,202.0 million related to core reserves and $465.4 million related to asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort ("APMT") reserves (after tax and minority interest). The net prior year development also resulted in additional cessions to CNA's reinsurance contracts, including the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties. These additional cessions resulted in $60.3 million of interest expense (after tax and minority interest), which is recorded as a reduction in investment income. As previously reported, in order to assist CNA in replenishing statutory capital adversely impacted by the 2003 charges discussed above, in November of 2003 Loews purchased $750 million of a new series of CNA convertible preferred stock. Loews committed additional capital support of up to $500 million by February 27, 2004 through the purchase of surplus notes of Continental Casualty Company ("CCC"), CNA's principal insurance subsidiary, in the event certain additions to CCC's statutory capital are not achieved through asset sales. In addition, Loews committed to an additional $150 million of capital support by March 31, 2004, in a form to be determined. As a result of CNA's sale of its group benefits business, Loews expects that it will be obligated to purchase $45 million of CCC surplus notes pursuant to such commitment. In addition, CNA has recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its individual life business and has estimated that this sale will result in an addition to CCC's statutory surplus in excess of $400 million. However, this sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is not expected to be consummated by February 26, 2004. As a result, Loews will be obligated to purchase $300 million of additional CCC surplus notes. CNA has stated that, following the consummation of the individual life sale, it plans to seek approval from the insurance regulatory authority for the repayment of the surplus notes purchased in relation to such sale, although no assurance can be given that sale of the individual life business will be consummated or that the regulatory approval will be obtained. Consolidated loss from continuing operations for the year ended 2003 was $666.1 million, compared to income of $978.6 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Loss from continuing operations includes net investment gains of $338.3 million (after tax and minority interest), compared to a loss of $116.7 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The net loss reflects the unfavorable net prior year premium and loss development and increase in bad debt reserves recorded in 2003 as discussed above and lower results from Lorillard, partially offset by the improvement in net investment gains. Loss from continuing operations attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2003 amounted to $781.3 million or $4.21 per share, compared to income of $837.9 million or $4.46 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Loss from continuing operations includes net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock of $339.7 million, compared to losses of $122.0 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2003 amounted to $115.2 million or $2.76 per Carolina Group share, compared to $140.7 million or $3.50 per share in the prior year. Page 3 of 7 Components of Net Income (Loss) - ------------------------------- (a) Includes a gain of $56.7 in the year ended December 31, 2003 from the sale of a hotel property. The year ended December 31, 2002 includes a $31.0 loss from CNA's sale of its life operations in Chile. (b) Represents the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which was a change in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets at CNA. # # # At December 31, 2003, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $60.92 per Loews common share compared to $61.68 per Loews common share at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, there were 185,447,050 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 57,965,000 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries', outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In February 2002 the Company created a class of common stock, called Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Company's assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. In an initial public offering, the Company issued 40,250,000 shares of Carolina Group stock representing an interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group. On November 25, 2003, the Company sold 18,055,000 shares of Carolina Group stock. Loews common stock represents the economic performance of the Company's remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group Stock. At December 31, 2003, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 33.43% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.

Net income attributable to the Loews Group intergroup interest for the fourth quarter of 2003 amounted to $84.3 million, compared to $123.4 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock (NYSE:CG) for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $34.8 million, or $0.74 per share of Carolina Group stock, compared to $36.9 million, or $0.92 per share in the prior year. Carolina Group net income for the 2003 fourth quarter includes net investment gains of $0.6 million, compared to $2.2 million in the prior year. Net investment gains attributable to Carolina Group stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 were $0.2 million and $0.5 million. Net sales for the Carolina Group were $787.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $834.3 million in 2002. The decline in net sales reflects increased sales promotion expenses, partially offset by improved unit sales volume of 6.9%. Carolina Group net income for the year ended 2003 was $468.3 million, compared to $681.5 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income for 2003 was reduced by after-tax charges of $17.1 million to settle litigation with tobacco growers and $17.5 million to resolve indemnification claims and trademark matters in connection with the 1977 sale by Lorillard of its international business.

Net sales for the Carolina Group were $3.256 billion in 2003 compared to $3.798 billion in 2002. The decline in net sales reflects lower unit sales volume of 2.8% and increased sales promotion expenses. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Carolina Group stock had been issued at January 1, 2002, net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2002 would have been $154.7 million or $3.85 per share of Carolina Group stock. This pro forma information is based on the historical results of operations of the Carolina Group, adjusted to accrue interest expense at 8% per annum on $2.500 billion of notional intergroup debt and an adjustment to income taxes for the impact of the interest expense. Per share amounts are based on income available to Carolina Group shareholders. At December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance of notional debt was $2.032 billion. The Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of the Company's assets and liabilities, referred to as the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. The Carolina Group, a notional group, is not a separate legal entity. The purpose of this financial information is to provide investors with additional information to use in analyzing the results of operations and financial condition of the Carolina Group, and this financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information of Loews Corporation.
