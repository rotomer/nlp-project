Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Peter W. Keegan Senior Vice President (212) 521-2950 Candace Leeds V.P. of Public Affairs (212) 521-2416 Joshua E. Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS ------------------------- NET INCOME FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 ---------------------------------------- NEW YORK, April 29, 2004-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2004 first quarter of $43.6 million, compared to $190.0 million in the 2003 first quarter. Income before net investment losses attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $286.2 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared to $218.3 million in the comparable 2003 quarter. Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $277.0 million (after tax and minority interest) due primarily to an impairment loss of $368.3 million (after tax and minority interest) for CNA's planned sale of its individual life insurance business, compared to net investment losses of $56.6 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The life business sale is expected to provide additional statutory capital of approximately $500.0 million to CNA. Results for 2004 reflect improved underwriting performance for the property and casualty operations of CNA Financial, the Company's 91% owned subsidiary, and income contribution from Texas Gas, which was acquired in May of 2003. Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below. Page 1 of 5 (a) Includes an impairment loss of $368.3 (after tax and minority interest) in 2004 related to CNA's planned sale of its individual life insurance business. Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the first quarter of 2004 amounted to $9.2 million or $0.05 per share, compared to $161.4 million or $0.87 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the first quarter of 2004 was $34.4 million or $0.59 per Carolina Group share, compared to $28.6 million, or $0.72 per Carolina Group share in the first quarter of 2003. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2004 amounted to $3.5 billion compared to $3.9 billion in the comparable 2003 quarter. The decline in revenues reflects CNA's sale of its Group Benefits business and the impact of the planned sale of the individual life insurance business. # # # At March 31, 2004, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $61.23, compared to $60.92 at December 31, 2003. At March 31, 2004, there were 185,486,300 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 57,966,750 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries', outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. The Company has two classes of common stock, Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Company's assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Company's remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group Stock. At March 31, 2004, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 33.43% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.

Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- CAROLINA GROUP REPORTS NET INCOME --------------------------------- FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 ----------------------------- NEW YORK, April 29, 2004-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR) today reported Carolina Group net income for the 2004 first quarter of $103.0 million, compared to $124.4 million in the 2003 first quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 included a $28.0 million charge ($17.1 million after taxes) to resolve indemnification claims and trademark matters in connection with the 1977 sale by Lorillard of its international business. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock (NYSE:CG) for the first quarter of 2004 was $34.4 million, or $0.59 per share of Carolina Group stock, compared to $28.6 million, or $0.72 per share in the prior year. The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the first quarter of 2004, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, reflects the sale by Loews Corporation of 18,055,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in November of 2003, partially offset by the lower overall results of the Carolina Group. Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted by the sale of Carolina Group stock in November of 2003. Carolina Group stock represents a 33.43% and 23.01% economic interest in the Carolina Group for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net sales for the Carolina Group were $767.9 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared to $844.2 million in the 2003 first quarter. The decline in net sales reflects increased sales promotion expenses and a decrease in unit sales volume of 1.4%. Net income attributable to the Loews Group intergroup interest for the first quarter of 2004 amounted to $68.6 million, compared to $95.8 million in the comparable period of the prior year. The decline reflects the November of 2003 sale of Carolina Group stock discussed above and the lower overall results of the Carolina Group. Results of operations of the Carolina Group include interest expense of $24.6 and $29.5 million, net of taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on Page 1 of 4 notional intergroup debt. At March 31, 2004, $1.998 billion principal amount of notional intergroup debt was outstanding. The Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of the Company's assets and liabilities, referred to as the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. The Carolina Group, a notional group, is not a separate legal entity. The purpose of this financial information is to provide investors with additional information to use in analyzing the results of operations and financial condition of the Carolina Group, and this financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information of Loews Corporation. As of March 31, 2004, there were 57,966,750 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding representing a 33.43% economic interest. Depending on market conditions, the Company, for the account of the Carolina Group, from time to time may purchase shares of Carolina Group stock in the open market or otherwise. # # # Loews Corporation has issued a separate press release reporting its consolidated results for the first quarter of 2004, which accompanies this press release.
