Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Peter W. Keegan Senior Vice President (212) 521-2950 Candace Leeds V.P. of Public Affairs (212) 521-2416 Joshua E. Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 LOEWS CORPORATION - ----------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS ------------------------- NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 ----------------------------------------- NEW YORK, July 29, 2004-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2004 second quarter of $407.3 million, compared to $214.8 million in the 2003 second quarter. Income before net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $259.4 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to a loss of $61.1 million in the comparable 2003 quarter. Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains of $107.3 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to $251.0 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. Results for 2004 reflect improved underwriting performance for the property and casualty operations of CNA Financial, the Company's 91% owned subsidiary. The improved results are primarily due to significant unfavorable net prior year development recorded in the second quarter of 2003 as well as the continued favorable impact of rate increases in 2004 and CNA's focus on underwriting discipline and expense management. Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below: Page 1 of 5 (a) Includes a loss of $352.9 (after tax and minority interest) for the six months ended June 30, 2004 related to CNA's sale of its individual life insurance business. Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the second quarter of 2004 amounted to $366.7 million or $1.98 per share, compared to $189.8 million or $1.02 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the second quarter of 2004 was $40.6 million or $0.70 per Carolina Group share, compared to $25.0 million or $0.63 per Carolina Group share in the second quarter of 2003. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the second quarter of 2004. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2004 amounted to $3.9 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the comparable 2003 quarter. The decline in revenues reflects CNA's sale of its Group Benefits and Individual Life Insurance businesses as well as lower investment gains in the current period. Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 Compared With 2003 - ------------------------------------------------- Loews consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the first half of 2004 was $450.9 million, compared to $404.8 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Income before net investment losses attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $545.6 million in the first half of 2004 compared to $157.2 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $169.7 million (after tax and minority interest) due primarily to a loss of $352.9 million (after tax and minority interest) for CNA's sale of its individual life insurance business, compared to net investment gains of $194.4 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the first half of 2004 amounted to $375.9 million or $2.03 per share, compared to $351.2 million or $1.89 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the first half of 2004 was $75.0 million or $1.29 per Carolina Group share, compared to $53.6 million or $1.34 per Carolina Group share in the comparable period of the prior year. Consolidated revenues in the first half of 2004 amounted to $7.4 billion compared to $8.2 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. The decline in revenues reflects the sale of CNA's Group Benefits and Individual Life Insurance businesses as well as the impact of the $618.6 million investment loss related to the life sale. # # # At June 30, 2004, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $58.78, compared to $60.92 at December 31, 2003. The decline in book value per share is attributable to lower unrealized investment gains reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on CNA's fixed income portfolio, partially offset by the net income reported in 2004. At June 30, 2004, there were 185,489,600 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 57,966,750 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, Page 2 of 5 the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries', outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. The Company has two classes of common stock, Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Company's assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Company's remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group Stock. At June 30, 2004, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 33.43% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.
