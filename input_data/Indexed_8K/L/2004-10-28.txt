Kahn Investor Relations (212) 521-2788 LOEWS CORPORATION - ----------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS ------------------------- NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004 ---------------------------------------- NEW YORK, October 28, 2004-Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2004 third quarter of $277.6 million, compared to a loss of $1,382.9 million in the 2003 third quarter. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $728.5 million, compared to a loss of $978.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income (loss) and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below: (a) Includes income of $116.5 (after tax) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 from an investee's sale of four ultra-large crude oil tankers. (b) Includes a loss of $352.9 (after tax and minority interest) for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 related to CNA's sale of its individual life insurance business. Page 1 of 6 Quarter Ended September 30, 2004 Compared With 2003 - --------------------------------------------------- Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the third quarter of 2004 amounted to $224.2 million or $1.21 per share, compared to a loss of $1,409.7 million or $7.60 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Income before net investment gains (losses) attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $245.9 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to a loss of $1,573.3 million in the comparable 2003 quarter. Results for 2004 include charges at CNA Financial Corporation, the Company's 91%-owned subsidiary, of $158.8 million (after tax and minority interest) due to the impact of Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, partially offset by income of $116.5 million (after taxes) from Hellespont Shipping Corporation, a 49%-owned company, following the sale of its four ultra-large crude oil tankers. The 2003 third quarter results include significant charges by CNA for net prior year development of $1,345.8 million (after tax and minority interest) and an increase in bad debt reserves for insurance and reinsurance receivables of $298.9 million (after tax and minority interest). Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $21.7 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment gains of $107.8 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The decline is due primarily to losses at CNA related to derivative securities held to mitigate the effect of changes in long term interest rates on the value of the fixed maturity portfolio. While a decrease in long term interest rates during the third quarter resulted in a realized loss related to these derivatives, the fair value of CNA's fixed maturity portfolio benefited from the interest rate movements resulting in an increase in the Company's shareholders' equity. Consolidated net loss in the third quarter of 2003 also includes a gain from discontinued operations of $55.8 million, or $0.30 per share of Loews common stock, related to the sale of a hotel property. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the third quarter of 2004 was $53.4 million, or $0.92 per Carolina Group share, compared to $26.8 million, or $0.67 per Carolina Group share, in the third quarter of 2003. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the third quarter of 2004. Consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2004 amounted to $3.8 billion compared to $3.9 billion in the comparable 2003 quarter. The decline in revenues reflects CNA's sale of its group benefits business in December of 2003 and individual life insurance business in April of 2004. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2004 Compared With 2003 - ------------------------------------------------------- Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the first nine months of 2004 amounted to $600.1 million or $3.24 per share, compared to a loss of $1,058.5 million or $5.71 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Income before net investment losses attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $791.5 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared to a loss of $1,416.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Results for 2004 include income from the Hellespont Shipping Corporation transaction and the charges from the impact of the four hurricanes. The net loss in 2003 reflects CNA's unfavorable net prior year development and increase in bad debt reserves as discussed above. Page 2 of 6 Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $191.4 million (after tax and minority interest), compared to net investment gains of $302.2 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net investment losses is due primarily to a loss of $352.9 million (after tax and minority interest) from CNA's sale of its individual life insurance business and losses related to derivative securities discussed above. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the first nine months of 2004 was $128.4 million or $2.21 per Carolina Group share, compared to $80.4 million or $2.01 per Carolina Group share in the comparable period of the prior year. Consolidated revenues in the first nine months of 2004 amounted to $11.2 billion compared to $12.1 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. The decline in revenues reflects the sale of CNA's group benefits and individual life insurance businesses as well as the impact of the $618.6 million pretax investment loss related to the life sale. # # # At September 30, 2004, there were 185,499,300 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 57,966,750 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries', outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. The Company has two classes of common stock, Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Company's assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Company's subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Company's remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group stock. At September 30, 2004, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 33.43% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.

Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the third quarter of 2004 increased by $26.6 million, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year. $16.6 million of this increase reflects the increased economic interest (from 23.01% to 33.43%) of the Carolina Group stock in the Carolina Group as a result of the sale by Loews Corporation of 18,055,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in November of 2003. Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted by this sale of Carolina Group stock. Net sales for the Carolina Group were $879.3 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $842.8 million in the 2003 third quarter. The increase in net sales reflects lower sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction in net sales) offset by a decrease in unit sales volume of 3.5%. Results of operations of the Carolina Group include interest expense of $24.3 and $27.9 million, net of taxes, for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on notional intergroup debt.

The $48.0 million increase in net income Page 1 of 4 attributable to Carolina Group stock includes an increase of $40.0 million due to the November of 2003 sale by Loews Corporation of Carolina Group stock discussed above. Net sales for the Carolina Group were $2.515 billion in the first nine months of 2004, compared to $2.468 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net sales reflects a decrease in sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction in net sales) offset by a decrease in unit sales volume of 0.4%. Results of operations of the Carolina Group include interest expense of $73.3 and $87.8 million, net of taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on notional intergroup debt.
