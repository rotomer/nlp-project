(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date
,
provided
,
however

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

(g) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and stating in effect that:
 
(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders, directors and executive and audit committees of the Company and its significant subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to September 30, 2004:
 
 
(1)
   
Company officials have advised them that
with respect to the period subsequent to September 30, 2004, there were no changes, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company, except in each case for changes set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by th e Representatives; and
 
 
(2)
   
nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data) and Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K;
 
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or
 
14
 
statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on d emand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them solely and directly in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
 
 
8.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided
,
however
, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein
provided
 
further
, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (w) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Final Prospectus to the Representatives, (x) delivery of the Final Prospectus was required by the Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus and (z) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of sale of such securities to such person, a copy of the Final Prospectus.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
 
16
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the third paragraph related to concessions and reallowances, (iii) the sixth, seventh and eighth paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids, and (iv) the last sentence of the ninth paragraph related to the underwriter's agreement to reimburse the Company for a portion of its expenses in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The in demnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided
,
however
, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint co unsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall au thorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not,
 
17
 
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities;
prov ided
,
however
, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses, but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if co ntribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights
 
18
 
to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
 
9.
Default by an Underwriter.
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth oppos ite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwrit ers do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
 
10.
Termination.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exc hange or the Nasdaq National Market or the clearance or settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
11.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors,

2. 
  
The Company is authorized to do business in the State of New York.

3.
  
The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
 
4. 
  
The 2016 Notes and the 2035 Notes have each been duly authorized and executed by the Company, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the 2016 Notes and 2035 Notes will each constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.
 
5.
  
The statements in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" and in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of Notes," other than "Book-Entry System" (except the statements in the twelfth paragraph under such caption), insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Indenture and the 2016 Notes and the 2035 Notes referred to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
 
6.
  
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
7. 
  
The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be subject to registration and regulation as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 24, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between you and the Company, relating to the sale by the Company to you of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount 6% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "2035 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes, the "Securities") of the Company, to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1986, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as successor to the Chase Manhattan Bank, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 30, 1993, between the Company and the Trustee and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 18, 1997, between the Company and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In the above capacity, we have reviewed the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-104759) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act and the order declaring such registration statement effective on May 6, 2003 (such registration statement, as so
 
2
 
declared effective on May 6, 2003, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement") and (i) the prospectus, dated May 6, 2003 (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the offering of securities of the Company, which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement and (ii) the prospectus supplement, dated January 24, 2005 relating to the offering of the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Document (as defined below), the "Prospectus"). We also have reviewed the documents filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 listed on Schedule I hereto and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorpor ated Documents") and such other documents as we deemed appropriate. The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Securities Act at 10:00 a.m., on May 6, 2003, and pursuant to Section 309 of the Trust Indenture Act, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and we have been orally advised by the Commission that (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and (ii) no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission. The Prospectus Supplement has been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) of the General Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") under the Securities Act.
 
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, the general counsel of the Company, various outside counsel to the Company and/or its subsidiaries handling the various litigations referred to in the Incorporated Documents and the Prospectus, representatives of the independent accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. We did not participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with officers and other represent atives of the Company in the course of the conferences referred to above. We do not pass upon, or assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statements or the Prospectus and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except to the limited extent referred to in paragraph 4 of our opinion to you dated the date hereof).
 
We do not express any opinion or belief regarding, nor are we predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. We do not express any opinion or belief regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company.
 
On the basis of foregoing, (i) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and regulations under the Securities Act (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the
 
3
 
  
Registration Statement, including the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1")) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of such Form 10-K/A, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I have acted as counsel to Loews Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the issuance and sale of $100,000,000 principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2016 of the Company (the "2016 Notes") and $300,000,000 principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "2035 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement dated January 24, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the Underwriters. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In that connection, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have reviewed and examined: (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; (ii) the Underwriting Agreement; (iii) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; (iv) the By-laws of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; (v) the Indenture; (vi) the resolutions of the Board of Directors and the Securities Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Indenture and the issuance of the Notes; (vii) a copy of the global note representing the Notes and (viii) such other corporate records, certificates and other documents as I have considered necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
 
In rendering this opinion, I have relied with your consent: (A) as to matters of fact, on certificates and assurances of responsible officers of the Company and public officials and (B) as to opinions involving the Material Subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries, on opinions of the general counsels of each Material Subsidiary. I have with your consent also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing and the other limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
2
 
(i) the Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, with full corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(ii) each of the Material Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation or a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, with full power (corporate or other) and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(iii) all the outstanding shares of capital stock or limited liability company interests, as the case may be, of each Material Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and, in the case of capital stock, are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Final Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock or limited liability company interests, as the case may be, of the Material Subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to my knowledge, after due inquiry, any other security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance;
 
(iv) to my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required;
 
(v) none of the issue and sale of the Notes, the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, or the fulfillment of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or the imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or of its Material Subsidiaries that are corporations or the of certificate of formation or operating agreement of any Material Subsidiary that is a limited liability company, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any of its Mater ial Subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation,

judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or its Material Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its Material Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches, violations or impositions that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(vi) to my knowledge, no holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement;
 
(vii) although I have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus and I take no responsibility therefor, I have no reason to believe that as of the date of the filing of the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date or on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which I express no opinion); and
 
(viii) no consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required to be obtained by the Company under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and in the Final Prospectus and such other approvals as have been obtained.
 
I am expressing no opinion regarding, nor am I predicting or guaranteeing the outcome of, any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case and I am expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case on the Company or any Material Subsidiary.
 
I do not purport herein to cover the application of state blue sky or securities laws to the sale of the Notes.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal securities laws of the United States.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Lorillard Tobacco Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lorillard, Inc. (collectively, the "Company"). I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the purchase by you from Loews Corporation ("Parent"), a Delaware corporation and parent corporation of Lorillard, Inc., of $100,000,000 principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due 2016 of the Company (the "2016 Notes") and $300,000,000 principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2035 (the "2035 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes, the "Securities") of Parent pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 24, 2005, between you and Parent (the "Underwriting Agreement'). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
I have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (such Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, at the time it became effective, being hereinafter called the "Registration Statement") filed by Parent under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the prospectus supplement dated January 24, 2005, (such prospectus supplement, together with the basic prospectus dated May 6, 2003, and the documents incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act.
 
In addition, I have examined certain records of the Company relating to the matters covered by the opinions set forth in the numbered paragraphs below and have made such other investigations as I have deemed necessary in connection with the opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied, to the extent I deem such reliance proper, upon certain factual representations made in certificates given by officers of the Company in answer to inquiries.
 
As we have discussed, while I have general supervisory responsibility for all legal matters involving the Company, I must rely extensively on various attorneys at the Company and various outside law firms which handle particular matters for the

Company. Accordingly, my personal knowledge of a significant number of cases and other matters is substantially limited. The opinions contained in this letter merely constitute expressions of my professional judgment regarding the matters of law addressed herein. I am expressing no opinion regarding, nor am I predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. Further, I am expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company. For purposes of the opinion in the first numbered paragraph below, I have consulted with such other attorneys at the Company and outside counsel as I have deemed appropriate.
 
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to me as certified, facsimile, conformed, electronic or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents, and oral and written statements and representations, of government officials and other officers and representatives of the Company and Parent and, in certain instances, written statements of the Underwriters and upon the representations and warranties of Parent and, in certain instances, the Under writers, contained in the Underwriting Agreement. I have not independently verified such information and assumptions.
 
I have investigated such questions of law for the purpose of rendering this opinion as I have deemed necessary. This opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the laws of the State of North Carolina and the General Corporate Law of Delaware. I disclaim any opinion as to any statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, order or other promulgation of any other jurisdiction or of any regional or local governmental body.
 
On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth above, I am of the opinion that:
 
 
(A) in the Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2003 ("Annual Report") under the headings "Business -- Lorillard, Inc. -- Legislation and Regulation," "Business -- Lorillard, Inc. -- Federal Regulation," "Business -- Lorillard, Inc. -- State and Local Regulation," together with "Business - Lorillard, Inc. -- Advertising and Marketing," when considered in their entirety; and
 
(B) in the Annual Report under the headings "Legal Proceedings -- Tobacco Related" and "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 21. Legal Proceedings -- Tobacco Related" and in Exhibit 99.01 to the Annual Report together with the statements in the Parent's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter

incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus constitute a complete and accurate summary in all material respects of the matters referred to therein;
 
 
 
In addition, although I have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 1 above, I have no reason to believe that the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, other than the portions of Note 21 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Note 14 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in the Quarterly Report referred to above, and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, as to which I do not express any view), to the extent it relates to the Company, at the time it became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, (except for the financial statements, other than the portions of Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Note 14 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in the Quarterly Report referred to above, and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, as to which I do not express any view), to the extent it relates to the Company, as of the date hereof includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
