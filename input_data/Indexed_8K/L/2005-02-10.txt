FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEW YORK, February 10, 2005Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2004 fourth quarter of $502.8 million, compared to $367.4 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,231.3 million, compared to a net loss of $610.7 million in the prior year.
Net income (loss) and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:
Page 1 of 6
Quarter Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With 2003
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to $446.7 million or $2.41 per share, compared to $332.6 million or $1.79 per share in the comparable period of the prior year.
Income before net investment gains attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $361.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $345.4 million in the comparable 2003 quarter. In 2004, investment gains (losses) related to the Corporate trading portfolio were reclassified to net investment income. Earlier years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This reclassification had no impact on net income (loss).
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains of $85.6 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment losses of $12.8 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. This increase was due primarily to a loss recorded in 2003 of $116.4 million (after tax and minority interest) from the sale by CNA Financial Corporation, the Companys 91%-owned subsidiary, of its Group Benefits business to Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $56.1 million or $0.93 per Carolina Group share, compared to $34.8 million or $0.74 per Carolina Group share in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year, is due to improved overall results of the Carolina Group and reflects the increased economic interest to 34.68% for the three months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 29.23% for the comparable period of the prior year, due to the sale by Loews Corporation of 10,000,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in December of 2004. Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted by the sale of Carolina Group stock. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to $4.1 billion compared to $4.3 billion in the comparable 2003 quarter. The decline in revenues reflects CNAs sale of its Group Benefits business in December of 2003 and individual life insurance business in April of 2004.
Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With 2003
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2004 amounted to $1,046.8 million or $5.64 per share, compared to a loss of $725.9 million or $3.91 per share in the prior year.
Income before net investment gains (losses) attributable to Loews common stock amounted to $1,191.7 million in the year ended 2004 compared to a loss of $1,044.4 million in the prior year. Results for 2004 include charges at CNA of $158.8 million (after tax and minority interest) due to the impact of the Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, partially offset by income of $116.5 million (after taxes) from Hellespont Shipping Corporation, a 49%-owned company, following the sale of its four ultra-large oil tankers. The 2003 results include charges by CNA for net prior year development of $1,667.4 million (after tax and minority interest) and

an increase in bad debt reserves for insurance and reinsurance receivables of $356.9 million (after tax and minority interest).
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $144.9 million (after tax and minority interest), compared to net investment gains of $263.1 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year. Net investment losses in 2004 are due primarily to a loss of $352.9 million (after tax and minority interest) from CNAs sale of its individual life insurance business.
Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2004 was $184.5 million or $3.15 per Carolina Group share, compared to $115.2 million or $2.76 per Carolina Group share in the prior year.
Consolidated revenues for the year ended 2004 amounted to $15.2 billion compared to $16.5 billion in the prior year. The decline in revenues reflects CNAs sale of its Group Benefits business in December of 2003 and the sale of the individual life insurance business in April of 2004.
At December 31, 2004, there were 185,584,575 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 67,967,250 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
The Company has two classes of common stock, Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Companys assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Companys subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Companys remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group Stock. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 39.19% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.

The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to the comparable period of the prior year, is due to improved overall results of the Carolina Group and reflects the increased economic interest to 34.68% for the three months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 29.23% for the comparable period of the prior year, due to the sale by Loews Corporation of 10,000,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in December of 2004.

Net sales for the Carolina Group were $832.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $787.7 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. The increase in net sales reflects an increase in unit sales volume of 2.9%, partially offset by an increase in sales promotion expenses.
