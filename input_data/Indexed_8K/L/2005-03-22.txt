FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEW YORK, March 22, 2005 -
Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR) announced today that on April 21, 2005 it will redeem all of its outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount 3-1/8% Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2007 (CUSIP Number 540424 AL 2) at a redemption price of 100.9375% of the principal amount, plus interest accrued to that date. On that date, the redemption price will become payable to the holders of the 3-1/8% Notes and the 3-1/8% Notes will cease accruing interest.
The 3-1/8% Notes are exchangeable into shares of Common Stock of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (NYSE:DO) at an exchange rate of 15.3757 shares per $1,000 principal amount of 3-1/8% Notes (equivalent to an exchange price of $65.04 per share, without taking into account the redemption premium or any accrued interest). The right to exchange will expire at the close of business on April 21, 2005.
The Indenture which governs the 3-1/8% Notes provides that the Company may make a cash settlement in respect of any 3-1/8% Note surrendered for exchange by notifying the tendering noteholder of its intention to do so not more than five trading days after such 3-1/8% Note is surrendered for exchange. Any such cash settlement will be in an amount, for each $1,000 principal amount of 3-1/8% Notes delivered for exchange, equal to the greater of: (A) $1,000; and (B) the product of (i) the exchange rate described above and (ii) the average closing price of Diamond Offshore Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the five trading days commencing two trading days after the Company delivers the above notice to the tendering noteholder, all as provided in the Indenture.
The Company stated that it plans to fund the redemption price from its working capital, although it may determine to offer and sell new debt securities before or after the redemption is effected to fund a portion of the redemption price.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Indenture Trustee, is the Paying Agent for payment of the redemption price and the Exchange Agent for exchange of 3-1/8% Notes. 3-1/8% Notes may be presented to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Paying Agent or Exchange Agent, at any of the following addresses:
Copies of the Notice of Redemption may be obtained from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Corporate Trust Services, 2001 Bryan Street, 9th Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, telephone number 800.275.2048.
