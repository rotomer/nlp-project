Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):

On March 21, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Registrants Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) established annual incentive awards for 2005 (the 2005 Awards) under the Loews Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Officers (the Plan).
The 2005 Awards are based on a 2005 corporate performance goal of 2% of the Registrants Performance Based Income for 2005. Performance Based Income is defined in the Plan, as the Plan has been amended, subject to shareholder approval at the Registrants 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as the consolidated net income of the Company and its subsidiaries (Net Income), as adjusted by the Committee in accordance with the Plan to take into account specified objective factors.
In the event the amended Plan is not approved by shareholders, the 2005 Awards will be based on the Plan without giving effect to the proposed amendment and the 2005 corporate performance goal will be 2% of Net Income, subject to the same maximum awards noted below.
The maximum 2005 Award for each of the participating executive officers is as follows: James S. Tisch, $1,250,000; Andrew H. Tisch, $1,250,000; Jonathan M. Tisch, $1,250,000; Arthur L. Rebell, $1,150,000; and Peter W. Keegan, $615,000. In accordance with the amended Plan, the Compensation Committee has retained negative discretion to reduce any 2005 Award payable to any of these officers.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
