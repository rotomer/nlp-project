NEW YORK, October 27, 2005Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR) today reported Carolina Group net income for the 2005 third quarter of $172.0 million, compared to $159.9 million in the 2004 third quarter.

The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the third quarter of 2005, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, reflects the sale by Loews Corporation of 10,000,000 shares of Carolina Group stock in December of 2004. Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted by the sale of Carolina Group stock in December of 2004. Carolina Group stock represents a 39.26% and 33.43% economic interest in the Carolina Group for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net income also increased due to $3.3 million ($2.1 million after taxes) of improved performance of limited partnership investments.
 
Net sales for the Carolina Group were $928.4 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $879.3 million in the 2004 third quarter, reflecting an increase in unit sales volume of 3.3%.

The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock reflects the December of 2004 sale by Loews Corporation of Carolina Group stock discussed above. Net income also increased due to $2.9 million ($1.7 million after taxes) of improved performance of limited partnership investments.
Net sales for the Carolina Group were $2.652 billion in the first nine months of 2005, compared to $2.515 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net sales reflects an increase in unit sales volume of 3.1% and reduced sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction in net sales).
