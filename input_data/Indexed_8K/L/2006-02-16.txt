On February 16, 2006, Registrant issued a press release for Loews Corporation and a separate press release for the Carolina Group providing information on their results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended 2005. The information disclosed in this report pursuant to Item 2.02, including the exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
The Registrant will restate its annual financial statements for the years 2001 through 2004, as well as its interim financial statements through September 30, 2005.
The restatement is to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired by the Registrants 91%-owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation (CNA) in CNAs merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. A current review by CNA of its discontinued operations identified an overstatement of the net assets of these discontinued operations and errors in accounting for the periodic results of these operations.
As a result of this restatement, the Registrants consolidated financial statements for 2001 through 2004, and the related independent registered public accountants reports thereon, as well as the Registrants interim financial statements through September 30, 2005, should no longer be relied upon. The Registrants consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, to be filed on Form 10-K on or before March 16, 2006, will include the effects of this restatement.
The determination to restate was made by the Audit Committee of the Registrants Board of Directors on February 14, 2006 upon Registrant managements recommendation and in consultation with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Registrants independent registered public accounting firm.
2
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1,211.6 million, compared to $1,215.8 million in the prior year.
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the following table:
Page 1 of 6
The Company will restate its financial results for prior years to correct the accounting by the Companys 91% owned subsidiary, the CNA Financial Corporation (CNA), for business reported as discontinued operations.
Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With 2004
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the fourth quarter of 2005 amounted to $46.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $444.2 million, or $2.39 per share, in the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a loss related to CNAs significant commutation of reinsurance finite contracts ($203.5 million after tax and minority interest) and non-commutation related adverse net development ($126.9 million after tax and minority interest), partially offset by improved results at the Companys 54% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (Diamond Offshore).
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $49.0 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment gains of $85.6 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year.
Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $81.6 million, or $1.11 per Carolina Group share, compared to $56.1 million, or $0.93 per Carolina Group share, in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2005 is due to improved overall results of the Carolina Group and reflects the increase in the amount of Carolina Group shares.
The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the fourth quarter and full year of 2005.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004 amounted to $4.1 billion.
Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With 2004
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2005 amounted to $960.3 million, or $5.16 per share, compared to $1,031.3 million, or $5.56 per share, in the prior year. The results for the year ended December 31, 2005 include a benefit of $136.5 million related to a federal income tax settlement due primarily to net refund interest and the release of federal income tax reserves, and catastrophe losses at CNA of $304.8 million (after tax and minority interest) primarily related to Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, Rita, Dennis and Ophelia. Net income also reflects the impact of the CNA commutations and adverse net development discussed above, partially offset by improved results at Diamond Offshore. In 2004, CNA incurred catastrophe losses of $178.9 million (after tax and minority interest) also primarily related to hurricanes. Net income for 2004 also included $116.5 (after taxes) from an affiliates sale of four ultra-large oil tankers.
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $10.3 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment losses of $144.9 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year due primarily to a loss of $352.9 million (after tax and minority interest) in 2004 from CNAs sale of its individual life insurance business.

Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2005 was $251.3 million, or $3.62 per Carolina Group share, compared to $184.5 million, or $3.15 per Carolina Group share, in the prior year and
is primarily due to improved overall results and the stock sales as mentioned above.
Consolidated revenues for the year ended 2005 amounted to $16.0 billion compared to $15.2 billion in the prior year.
The increase in revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of Gulf South in December of 2004, improved results at Diamond Offshore and the impact of a loss recorded in 2004 related to CNAs sale of its individual life business.
Financial Restatement
The Company will restate its financial statements for the years 2001 through 2004, as well as its interim financial statements through September 30, 2005. The restatement is to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired in CNAs merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. A current review of discontinued operations identified an overstatement of the net assets of these discontinued operations and errors in CNAs accounting for the periodic results of these operations.
The Company will file a Form 10-K for 2005 reflecting the effects of the restatement as follows:
At December 31, 2005, there were 185,846,889 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 78,191,678 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market conditions, the Company purchases, from time to time in the open market or otherwise, shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock.
