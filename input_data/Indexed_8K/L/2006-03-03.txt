On February 28, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Registrants Board of Directors (Committee) approved the performance criteria to be used for annual incentive awards for 2006 (the 2006 Awards) under the Loews Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Officers (the Plan).
The Committee established a 2006 corporate performance goal of 2% of the Registrants Performance Based Income for such year. Performance Based Income is defined in the Plan as the Registrants consolidated net income, as adjusted by the Committee to take into account specified objective factors which in its judgment, do not reflect upon the operating performance of the Registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The 2006 Awards are payable to Plan participants out of the established corporate performance goal, subject to a maximum payment amount established by the Committee for each such participant, and to the Committees discretion to reduce the amount of any such award.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
