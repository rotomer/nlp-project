ITEM: Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
The Registrant will restate its annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, as well as its interim financial statements through September 30, 2005, to correct classification errors within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in those financial statements for amounts derived from activities at the Registrants 91% owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation (CNA). These corrections resulted from a recent review and analysis by CNA of the classifications of its cash flows.
The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 will be restated to reflect the following:
As a result of the restatements, the Registrants previously reported cash flows from continuing operations provided (used) by operating, investing and financing activities will be increased or decreased for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 as follows:
 
 
 
This restatement is attributable to the fact that CNA did not have an effectively designed control process to ensure correct classification of its cash flow activity which is reflected in the Registrants Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The restatements related to cash flows will have no impact on the total change in cash from continuing operations within the Registrants Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As a result of this restatement, and the restatement to correct CNAs accounting for discontinued operations, as disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2006, the Registrants consolidated financial statements for 2001 through 2004, and the related independent registered public accounting firms reports thereon, as well as the Registrants interim financial statements through September 30, 2005, should no longer be relied upon. The Registrants consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, to be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for such year, will include the effects of this restatement.
In addition, the Registrant will revise its 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to discontinued operations, as well as to include the cash balances related to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The determination to restate was made by the Audit Committee of the Registrants Board of Directors on March 7, 2006 upon Registrant managements recommendation and in consultation with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Registrants independent registered public accounting firm.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
