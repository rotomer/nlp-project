Each written ballot shall be signed by the Stockholder voting or by the proxy of such Stockholder, and shall state the number of shares voted. On all other questions, the voting may be voice vote. Every Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy.
