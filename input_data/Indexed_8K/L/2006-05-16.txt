(ii)
each of the Material Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation or a limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, with the requisite power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified

to the knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required;
 
(vi)
neither the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or its Material Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its Material Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches, violations or impositions

(ix)
although he has not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Disclosure Package and takes no responsibility therefor, such counsel has no reason to believe that the documents specified in a schedule to such counsels letter, consisting of those included in the Disclosure Package, when taken together as a whole, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and
 
(x)
no consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required to be obtained by the Company under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated in this Agreement and in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained.
 
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the General Corporate Law of Delaware or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom he believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the
 
17
 
 
Underwriters, (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials and (C) as to opinions involving the Material Subsidiaries, on opinions of the counsels of those Material Subsidiaries. Such opinion may contain customary assumptions, exceptions, limitations, qualifications and comments. In addition, such opinion may contain statements to the effect that: (A) such counsel is expressing no opinion regarding, nor is such counsel predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case, and (B) such counsel is expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case on the Company or the Carolina Group Stock.

(i)
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date,
provided
,
however
, that if any such representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality, such representation or warranty as so qualified is true and correct in all respects on and as of the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii)

(k)
The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and stating in effect that:
 
19
 
(i)
in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(ii)
on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006 and as at March 31, 2006 carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders, directors and executive and audit committees of the Company and its significant subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to December 31, 2005, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
 
(1)
any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus;
 
(2)
with respect to the period subsequent to March 31, 2006, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or of the Carolina Group or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders equity of the Company or decreases in the combined attributed net assets of the Carolina Group as compared with the corresponding amounts shown on the March 31, 2006 balance sheets included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from April 1, 2006 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the
 
20
 
corresponding period in the preceding year in net income of the Company and its subsidiaries or of the Carolina Group or in operating income of the Company and its subsidiaries or of the Carolina Group, in each case, on either a total or per share basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives;
 
(3)
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information) and Item 402 (Executive Compensation) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K;
 
(iii)
they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
 
 
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (k) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
 
(l)
Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (k) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Carolina Group, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
21
 
(m)
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
(n)
Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Companys debt securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
 
(o)
Subject to official notice of issuance, the Securities shall have been listed and admitted and authorized for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and satisfactory evidence of such actions shall have been provided to the Representatives.
 
(p)

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10019, on the Closing Date.
 
7.
Reimbursement of Underwriters Expenses.
If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through UBS Securities LLC on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them solely and directly in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
 
8.
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
a)
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter
 
22
 
within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided
,
however
, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)  Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading Underwriting, (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
 
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such
 
 
23
 
 
failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided
,
however
, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d)  In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively Losses) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities;
provided
,
however
, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
 
 
24
 
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses, but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
9.
Default by an Underwriter.
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve
 
 
25
 
any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
 
10.
Termination.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
11.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

par value $0.01 per share
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 10, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between you (the "Underwriter"), and the Company, relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriter of 15,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of Carolina Group stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Carolina Group stock") of the Company.
 
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In the above capacity, we have reviewed the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132334) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on March 10, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including the Incorporated Documents (as defined below) and the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement as of the date hereof pursuant to Rule 430B of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations") (such registration statement, at the time it became effective, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"), and (i) the prospectus, dated March 10, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the offering of securities of the Company, which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement, (ii) the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated May 10, 2006 (together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, the "Preliminary Prospectus"), relating to the offering of the Securities, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, and (iii) the prospectus supplement, dated May 10, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus

and the Incorporated Documents, the "Prospectus"), relating to the offering of the Securities, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations.
 
We also have reviewed the documents identified on Schedule I hereto filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents") and such other documents as we deemed appropriate. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1(d) of the Underwriting Agreement and that the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act that would prevent the use of the Registration Statement, the Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 of the Securities Act, and we have been orally advised by the Commission that (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and (ii) no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
 
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, the general counsel of the Company, various outside counsel to the Company and/or its subsidiaries handling the various litigations referred to in the Incorporated Documents and the Prospectus Supplement, representatives of the independent accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriter and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriter, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package (as defined below) and related matters were discussed. We did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with officers and other representatives of the Company in the course of the conferences referred to above. We do not pass upon, or assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except to the limited extent referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 of our opinion to you dated the date hereof).
 
We express no opinion or belief regarding, nor are we predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. We express no opinion or belief regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company or the Carolina Group stock.

On the basis of the foregoing, (i) the Registration Statement, as of March 10, 2006 and as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of March 10, 2006 and as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement). In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement.
 
As used herein, "Applicable Time" means 4:15 p.m. (Eastern time) on May 10, 2006 and "General Disclosure Package" means the Preliminary Prospectus and the information included on Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Senior Vice President, Legal and External Affairs, General Counsel and Secretary of Lorillard Tobacco Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lorillard, Inc. (collectively, the Company). I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the purchase by you from Loews Corporation (Parent), a Delaware corporation and parent corporation of Lorillard, Inc., of 15,000,000 shares of Carolina Group Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Shares) of Parent pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 10, 2006, between you and Parent (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
I have examined: (1) the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (such Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, at the time it became effective, being hereinafter called the Registration Statement) filed by Parent under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act); (2) the basic prospectus dated March 10, 2006, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Basic Prospectus); (3) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2006 (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and, together with the Basic Prospectus, being hereinafter called the Preliminary Prospectus), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission); (4) the final prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2006, (the Final Prospectus and, together with the Basic Prospectus, being hereinafter called the Prospectus), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b); and (5) the other information, if any, identified in Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement (together with the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Execution Time and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, as amended and supplemented to the Execution Time, being hereinafter called the Disclosure Package).
 
In addition, I have examined certain records of the Company relating to the matters covered by the opinions set forth in the numbered paragraphs below and have made such other investigations as I have deemed necessary in connection with the opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied, to the extent I deem such reliance proper, upon certain factual representations made in certificates given by officers of the Company in answer to inquiries.
 
As we have discussed, while I have general supervisory responsibility for all legal matters involving the Company, I must rely extensively on various attorneys at the Company and various outside law firms which handle particular matters for the

Company. Accordingly, my personal knowledge of a significant number of cases and other matters is substantially limited. The opinions contained in this letter merely constitute expressions of my professional judgment regarding the matters of law addressed herein. I am expressing no opinion regarding, nor am I predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. Further, I am expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company or the Shares.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the 
Parent
), its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Inc., a Delaware corporation (

) (Parent, LI, and LTC are referred to collectively as the 
Company
 or the

), in connection with the purchase by you from Parent of 15,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the 
Carolina Group Stock
) of Parent pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 10, 2006, between you and Parent (the 
Underwriting Agreement
). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(e) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We have examined: (1) the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (such Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, at the time it became effective (the 
Effective Date
), is referred to as the 
Registration Statement
) filed by Parent under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
Act
); (2) the basic prospectus dated March 10, 2006, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the 
Basic Prospectu
s); (3) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2006 (the P
reliminary Prospectus Supplement
 and, together with the Basic Prospectus, is referred to as the Preliminary Prospectus), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
Commission
); (4) the final prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2006, (the Final Prospectus and, together with the Basic Prospectus, is referred to as the 
Prospectus
), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b); and (5) the other information, if any, identified in Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement and the issuer free writing prospectuses, if any, identified in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement (together with the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Execution Time and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, as amended and supplemented to the Execution Time, is referred to as the 
Disclosure Package
).
 
In addition, we have examined certain records of the Company relating to the matters covered by the opinions set forth in the numbered paragraph below and, subject to the limitations set forth herein, have made such other investigations as we have deemed necessary in connection with the opinion set forth in such numbered paragraph.
 
Based upon such examination and review, and subject to the other qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

;
 
 
as incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus that describe cigarette and chewing tobacco product liability lawsuits that are included in the SHB Cases as they relate to the Disclosure Package, as of the Execution Time, when taken together as a whole, and the Prospectus, at the date thereof (except as may be set forth on Schedule A attached to this letter) or hereof (except as may be set forth on Schedule B attached to this letter) did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except for the financial statements, other than the portions of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in the Quarterly Report referred to above, and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, if any, as to which we do not express any view).
 
As we have discussed, we are primary legal counsel to the Company with respect to approximately 2,775 SHB Cases. A significant number of product liability lawsuits (including cigarette and chewing tobacco lawsuits) are pending against the Company, for which we do not act as primary legal counsel of record to the Company, and may have been overtly threatened against the Company, for which we do not act as primary legal counsel to the Company (collectively, the 
NonSHB Cases
). Our knowledge about the NonSHB Cases is substantially more limited than our knowledge about the SHB Cases (the SHB Cases and the NonSHB Cases are collectively referred to herein as the 
Product Liability Cases
). Further, we do not serve as legal counsel to the Company other than in connection with the SHB Cases and as a result we are not corporate, securities, regulatory or antitrust counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and we have not advised the Company on compliance with the requirements of the applicable federal or state securities laws or on the Carolina Group Stock.
 
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein. We confirm that we have read the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement and we have reviewed the descriptions of the Product Liability Cases described therein. We confirm that we have reviewed generally our files relating to the SHB Cases, we have reviewed this opinion with the attorneys who currently are partners in or employed by this firm and who are primarily responsible for the representation of the Company in the SHB Cases or who were directly involved in any material respect with the preparation of this letter (the 
Responsible Attorney Group
),
 
4
 
 
and we have had conversations with representatives of the legal departments of the Company regarding the contents of this letter, but we have not discussed the NonSHB Cases with any person or entity, we have not reviewed any files or any materials (other than the contents of the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement) relating to the NonSHB Cases, and we have not reviewed the contents of this letter with attorneys who are partners in or employees of this firm, other than the Responsible Attorney Group.
 
You acknowledge that the statements that are made herein to the best of our knowledge or as to matters that have come to our attention or matters as to which we believe (or the converse) in this letter are made based solely on the knowledge or awareness of the attorneys in the Responsible Attorney Group and that those statements do not include the knowledge or awareness of other attorneys who are partners in or employees of this firm who are not in the Responsible Attorney Group, including those who may be primarily responsible for representing parties to Products Liability Cases other than the Companies. Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that we are making no statements and giving no opinions with regard to the discussions in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of the State Settlement Agreements, the Master Settlement Agreement, Settlement of State Reimbursement Litigation, Tobacco-Related Antitrust Cases, or Antitrust Claims (as those terms are defined in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), the provisions of the Carolina Group Stock and the charter amendments creating those securities, or as to the actual or potential financial effect of the Products Liability Cases, individually or collectively, on the Company, its business, or its condition, financial or otherwise.
 
The opinions contained in this letter merely constitute expressions of our professional judgment regarding the matters of law addressed herein. We are expressing no opinion regarding, nor are we endorsing or adopting as our own opinion, any particular statement of opinion or belief attributed to the Company in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. We are expressing no opinion regarding, nor are we predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any Product Liability Case. Further, we are expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any Product Liability Case on the Company or the Carolina Group Stock.
 
Subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the descriptions of the Product Liability Cases in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus when considered in their entirety, (i) as they relate to the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except for the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, as to which we do not express any view); (ii) as they relate to the Disclosure Package, as of the Execution Time, when taken together as a whole, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except for the financial statements, other than the portions of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in
 
 
5
 
 
 
the Quarterly Report referred to above, and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, as to which we do not express any view) ; and (iii) as they relate to the Prospectus, at the date thereof or hereof contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except for the financial statements, other than the portions of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in the Quarterly Report referred to above, and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, as to which we do not express any view).
 
We have not considered and express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the United States of America.
 
This opinion letter is rendered only to you and solely for your benefit in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
