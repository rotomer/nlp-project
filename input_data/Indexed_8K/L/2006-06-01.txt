The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Act that would prevent its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or prevention and, upon such issuance, occurrence or prevention, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or prevention, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
 
12
 
(b)
If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
 
(c)
If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (3) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (4) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
(d)

(f)
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the
 
13
 
offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or take any action which would subject the Company to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not already subject to taxation.
 
(g)

provided
,
however
, that if any such representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality, such representation or warranty as so qualified is true and correct in all respects on and as of the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
17

The Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, signed by the Selling Stockholder, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signer of such certificate has carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any supplements or amendments thereto and this Agreement, and that the representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date to the same effect as if made on the Closing Date.
 
(i)
The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and stating in effect that:
 
(i)
in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(ii)
on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006 and as at March 31, 2006 carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders, directors and executive and audit committees of the Company and its significant subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial
 
18
 
and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to December 31, 2005, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
 
(1)
any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus;
 
(2)
with respect to the period subsequent to March 31, 2006, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders equity of the Company as compared with the corresponding amounts shown on the March 31, 2006 balance sheets included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from April 1, 2006 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year in net income of the Company and its subsidiaries or in operating income of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case, on either a total or per share basis, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives;
 
(3)
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information) and Item 402 (Executive Compensation) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K;
 
(iii)
they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the
 
19
 
Registration Statement agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
 
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (i) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
 
(j)
Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(k)
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
(l)
Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Companys debt securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
 
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10019, on the Closing Date.
 
7.
Reimbursement of Underwriters Expenses.
If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the
 
20
 
obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse or cause the Selling Stockholder to reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them solely and directly in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. If the Company is required to make any payments to the Underwriters under this Section 7 because of the Selling Stockholders refusal, inability or failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6, the Selling Stockholder shall reimburse the Company on demand for all amounts so paid.
 
8.
Indemnification and Contribution.
 (
a)
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided
,
however
, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)
The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with
 
21
 
reference to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have.
 
(c)
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and the Selling Stockholder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge that the statements set forth on Schedule I hereto constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
 
(d)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided
,
however
, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the
 
22
 
indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(e)
In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively Losses) to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, by the Selling Stockholder and by the Underwriters from the offering of the Securities;
provided
,
however
, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, of the Selling Stockholder and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and/or by the Selling Stockholder shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, the Selling Stockholder or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
 
23
 
paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e)
 
(f)
The liability of the Selling Stockholder under the Selling Stockholders representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the initial public offering price of the Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriters. The Company and the Selling Stockholder may agree, as between themselves and without limiting the rights of the Underwriters under this Agreement, as to the respective amounts of such liability for which they each shall be responsible.
 
9.
Default by an Underwriter.
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Selling Stockholder and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
 
24
 
10.
Termination.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
11.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers, of the Selling Stockholder and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Arms-length Transaction.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 25, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among you (the "Underwriter"), the selling stockholder named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Selling Stockholder") and the Company, relating to the sale by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter of 21,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's Loews common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock").
 
This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
 
(a)
 
the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132334) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on March 10, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including the Incorporated Documents (as defined below) and the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement as of the date hereof pursuant to Rule 430B of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (such registration statement,
 
at the time it became effective, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement");
 
(b)
 
the prospectus, dated March 10, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the offering of securities of the Company, which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement;

(d)
 
the documents identified on Schedule I hereto filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents");
 
(e)
 
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
 
(f)
 
the specimen certificate evidencing the Common Stock attached to the certificate of Gary W. Garson, Secretary of the Company, referenced in paragraph 4 below (the "Specimen Certificate");
 
(g)
 
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Incorporation");
 
(h)
 
the By-laws of the Company, as certified by Gary W. Garson, Secretary of the Company (the "By-laws");
 
(i)
 
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, adopted on April 11, 2006, and resolutions of the Special Committee thereof, adopted April 21, 2006 and May 23, 2006, in each case, as certified by Gary W. Garson, Secretary of the Company;
 
(l)
 
the certificate of James S. Tisch, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Peter W. Keegan, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the date hereof and the certificate of Peter W. Keegan, dated the date hereof, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Company's Certificates");
 
(m)
 
the certificate of Gary W. Garson, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, dated the date hereof, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Secretary's Certificate");
 
(n)
 
a certificate, dated May 25, 2006, and a facsimile bringdown thereof, dated May 31, 2006, from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as to the Company's existence and good standing in such jurisdiction (the "Delaware Certificates"); and
 
(o)
 
a certificate, dated May 25, 2006, and a facsimile bringdown thereof, dated May 31, 2006, from the Department of State of the State of New York, certifying that the Company is authorized to do business in the State of New York (the "New York Certificates").
 
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials, including the facts set forth in the Company's Certificates.
 
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
 
(a)
 
the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 below with respect to the valid existence and good standing of the Company is based solely upon the Delaware Certificates; and
 
(b)
 
the opinion set forth in paragraph 2 below is based solely upon the New York Certificates.
 
We do not express any opinion as to any laws other than (i) the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), (ii) those laws, rules and
 
regulations of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and (iii) the federal laws of the United States of America to the extent referred to specifically herein. Insofar as the opinions expressed herein relate to matters governed by laws other than those set forth in the preceding sentence, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect any of the opinions set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.
 
The Company is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to carry on its business and to own, lease and operate its properties, in each case as described in the Prospectus.
 
2.
 
The Company is authorized to do business in the State of New York.
 
3.
 
The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus, and the authorized capital stock of the Company conforms as to legal matters to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus.
 
4.
 
The Specimen Certificate complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, the DGCL and the New York Stock Exchange.
 
6.
 
The holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company do not have any preemptive rights or any similar rights arising under the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws or the DGCL to subscribe for the Securities as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
 
7.
 
The statements in the Base Prospectus under the headings "Description of Loews Capital Stock," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws and the DGCL, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
 
8.
 
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
9.
 
The Company is not subject to registration and regulation as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Without our prior written consent, this opinion may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by, or assigned to, any other person for any purpose, including any other person that acquires any Securities or that seeks to assert your rights in respect of this opinion (other than your successors in interest by means of merger, consolidation, transfer of a business or other similar transaction).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 25, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among you (the "Underwriter"), the selling stockholder named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Selling Stockholder") and the Company, relating to the sale by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter of 21,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's Loews common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Company.
 
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In the above capacity, we have reviewed the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132334) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on March 10, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including the Incorporated Documents (as defined below) and the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement as of the date hereof pursuant to Rule 430B of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations") (such registration statement, at the time it became effective, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"), and (i) the prospectus, dated March 10, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to the offering of securities of the Company, which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement and (ii) the prospectus supplement, dated May 25, 2006 (the Prospectus Supplement
 
and, together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, the "Prospectus"), relating to the offering of the Securities, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations.
 
We also have reviewed the documents identified on Schedule I hereto filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents"), the "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(1) of the Rules and Regulations) identified on Schedule II hereto relating to the Securities (the "Free Writing Prospectus") and such other documents as we deemed appropriate. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1(d) of the Underwriting Agreement and that the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act that would prevent the use of the Registration Statement, the Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 of the Securities Act, and we have been orally advised by the Commission that (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and (ii) no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
 
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, the general counsel of the Company, representatives of the independent accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriter, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriter and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Selling Stockholder, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package (as defined below) and related matters were discussed. We did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with officers and other representatives of the Company in the course of the conferences referred to above. We do not pass upon, or assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except to the limited extent referred to in paragraph 7 of our opinion to you dated the date hereof).
 
We express no opinion or belief regarding, nor are we predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. We express no opinion or belief regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company or the Common Stock.
 
 
On the basis of the foregoing, (i) the Registration Statement, as of March 10, 2006 and as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of March 10, 2006 and as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement). In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement.
 
As used herein, "Applicable Time" means 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on May 25, 2006 and "General Disclosure Package" means the Free Writing Prospectus, the Incorporated Documents and the Base Prospectus, all considered together.
 
In addition, based on the foregoing, we confirm to you that the Prospectus Supplement has been filed with the SEC within the time period required by Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations.
 
This letter is furnished only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the closing occurring today and the offering of the Securities, in each case pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. Without our prior written consent, this letter may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by, or assigned to, any other person for any purpose, including any other person that acquires Securities or that seeks to assert
 
your rights in respect of this letter (other than your successors in interest by means of merger, consolidation, transfer of a business or other similar transaction).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have acted as counsel to Loews Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the sale by Joan H. Tisch (the "Selling Stockholder") of 21,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's Loews common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Loews Common Stock") pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement dated May 25, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company, the Selling Stockholder and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as the underwriter (the "Underwriter"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in the Underwriting Agreement.
In that connection, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have reviewed and examined: (i) the Registration Statement; (ii) the base prospectus, dated March 10, 2006, relating to the offering of securities of the Company, which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"); (iii) the prospectus supplement, dated May 25, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the offering of the Shares (together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, the "Final Prospectus"); (iv) the "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(1) of the Rules and Regulations), dated May 25, 2006, identified on Schedule II hereto relating to the Securities (the "Free Writing Prospectus"); (v) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; (vi) the By-laws of the Company, as amended through the date hereof; (vii) a specimen certificate representing the Loews Common Stock; and (viii) the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the issuance of the Loews Common Stock. I have also reviewed the documents identified on Schedule I hereto filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents") and such other corporate records, certificates and other documents as I have considered necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
As used herein, "Disclosure Package" means the Base Prospectus, the Free Writing Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, all considered together.
In rendering this opinion, I have relied with your consent: (a) as to matters of fact, on certificates and assurances of responsible officers of the Company and public officials and (b) as to opinions involving the Material Subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries, on opinions of the general counsels of each Material Subsidiary. I have with your consent also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.
Based on and subject to the foregoing and the other limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
(i)
 
the Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws the State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(ii)
 
each of the Material Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation or a limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, with full power (corporate or other) and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or limited partnership and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(iii)
 
all the outstanding shares of capital stock or limited partnership interests, as the case may be, of each Material Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and, in the case of capital stock, are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock or limited partnership interests, as the case may be, of the Material Subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to my knowledge, after due inquiry, any other security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance;
(iv)
 
except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, to my knowledge, no options, warrants, preemptive rights or other rights to purchase from the Company, agreements or other obligations of the Company to issue, or rights to require the Company to convert any obligations into or exchange any securities for, shares of the Loews Common Stock are outstanding;
(v)
 
to my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property of a character required to be disclosed
in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required.
(vi)
 
none of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, or the fulfillment of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or the imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or of its Material Subsidiaries that are corporations or the certificate of formation or operating agreement of any Material Subsidiary that is a limited partnership, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or its Material Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its Material Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches, violations or impositions that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(vii)
 
to my knowledge, other than the rights of the Selling Stockholder pursuant to the Letter Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2006, between the Selling Stockholder and the Company, with respect to the sale of the Shares, no holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement;
(viii)
 
although I have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus and I take no responsibility therefor, I have no reason to believe that on March 10, 2006 the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which I express no opinion);
(ix)
 
although I have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Disclosure Package and I take no responsibility therefor, I have no reason to believe that the Disclosure Package, as of the Execution Time, when taken as a whole, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which I express no opinion); and
 
 
(ix)
 
no consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required to be obtained by the Company under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase from the Selling Stockholder and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter in the manner contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and in the Final Prospectus and such other approvals as have been obtained.
I am expressing no opinion regarding, nor am I predicting or guaranteeing the outcome of, any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case and I am expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case or insurance-related case on the Company or the Loews Common Stock.
I do not purport herein to cover the application of state blue sky or securities laws to the sale of the Loews Common Stock.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal securities laws of the United States.
This opinion is rendered only to you and solely for your benefit in connection with the above transaction. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by any other person, entity, firm or corporation for any purpose without my prior written consent. The opinions contained herein are limited to the matters expressly stated herein, and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein.

I am Senior Vice President, Legal and External Affairs, General Counsel and Secretary of Lorillard Tobacco Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lorillard, Inc. (collectively, the Company). I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the purchase by you from Joan H. Tisch (the Selling Stockholder) of 21,000,000 shares of Loews Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the Shares), of Loews Corporation (Parent), a Delaware corporation and parent corporation of Lorillard, Inc., pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 25, 2006, among you, the Selling Stockholder and the Parent (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
I have examined: (1) the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (such Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, at the time it became effective, being hereinafter called the Registration Statement) filed by Parent under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act); (2) the basic prospectus dated March 10, 2006, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Basic Prospectus); (3) the final prospectus supplement dated May 25, 2006, (the Final Prospectus and, together with the Basic Prospectus, being hereinafter called the Prospectus), filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 424(b); and (4) the "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(1) of the Rules and Regulations), dated May 25, 2006, identified on Schedule I hereto relating to the Securities (the "Free Writing Prospectus" and together with the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the Execution Time, being hereinafter called the Disclosure Package).
 
In addition, I have examined certain records of the Company relating to the matters covered by the opinions set forth in the numbered paragraphs below and have made such other investigations as I have deemed necessary in connection with the opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied, to the extent I deem such reliance proper, upon certain factual representations made in certificates given by officers of the Company in answer to inquiries.
 
As we have discussed, while I have general supervisory responsibility for all legal matters involving the Company, I must rely extensively on various attorneys at the Company and various outside law firms which handle particular matters for the Company. Accordingly, my personal knowledge of a significant number of cases and
 
4
 
other matters is substantially limited. The opinions contained in this letter merely constitute expressions of my professional judgment regarding the matters of law addressed herein. I am expressing no opinion regarding, nor am I predicting or guaranteeing, the outcome of any tobacco-related product liability case. Further, I am expressing no opinion regarding the effect of the outcome, whether financial or otherwise, of any tobacco-related product liability case on the Company or the Shares. For purposes of the opinion in the first numbered paragraph below, I have consulted with such other attorneys at the Company and outside counsel as I have deemed appropriate.
 
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to me as certified, facsimile, conformed, electronic or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents, and oral and written statements and representations, of government officials and other officers and representatives of the Company and Parent and, in certain instances, written statements of the Underwriters and upon the representations and warranties of Parent and, in certain instances, the Underwriters, contained in the Underwriting Agreement. I have not independently verified such information and assumptions.
 
I have investigated such questions of law for the purpose of rendering this opinion as I have deemed necessary. This opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the laws of the State of North Carolina and the General Corporate Law of Delaware. I disclaim any opinion as to any statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, order or other promulgation of any other jurisdiction or of any regional or local governmental body.
 
On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth above, I am of the opinion that:
