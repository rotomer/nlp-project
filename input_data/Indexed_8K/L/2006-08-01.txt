Consolidated net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $1,109.7 million, compared to $781.9 million in the prior year.
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 Compared With 2005
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the second quarter of 2006 amounted to $474.9 million or $0.85 per share, compared to $379.9 million or $0.68 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved results at the Companys 54% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and increased investment income.

The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the second quarter of 2006.

The results for the six months ended June 30, 2005 included a benefit of $109.2 million from a federal income tax settlement discussed above. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved results at the Companys 54% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and increased investment income.

The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock is
primarily due to higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction to net sales) and reflects an increase in the amount of Carolina Group shares outstanding.
Consolidated revenues in the first half of 2006 amounted to $8.5 billion, compared to $7.8 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
At June 30, 2006, there were 550,701,207 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 93,291,246 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding.
