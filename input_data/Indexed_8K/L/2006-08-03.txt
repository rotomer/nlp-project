Demand and Piggy-back Registrations
(a)
 
Upon the written request (a 
Registration Request
) to register shares of Transfer Restricted Securities by Holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the date of receipt of a Registration Request), a Registration Statement under the Securities Act registering the resale of such Transfer Restricted Securities and will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the Transfer Restricted Securities under all applicable state securities and blue sky laws on or prior to 150 days following the date of receipt of a Registration Request. Such request shall state the intended method of disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities sought to be registered, which may include the underwritten public offering of such Transfer Restricted Securities. Whenever the Company shall be requested to effect the registration of any Transfer Restricted Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section 2(a), the Company shall promptly give written notice of such proposed registration to all Holders stating that such Holders have the right to request that any or all of the Transfer Restricted Securities owned by them be included in such registration. The Company shall include in such registration all Transfer Restricted Securities with respect to which the Company receives written requests from the Holders thereof for inclusion therein (stating the intended method of disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities) if such requests are received within 20 calendar days of the Companys delivery of written notice pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Registration Statement shall be on Form S-1 or S-3 under the Securities Act or another appropriate registration permitting registration of such Transfer Restricted Securities for resale by the Holders in the manner or manners reasonably designated by them. The holders shall be entitled to request not more than three (3) such registrations pursuant to this Section 2(a). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective for a continuous period until such time as no Transfer Restriction Securities remain outstanding by supplementing and amending the Registration Statement to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for sales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the holder thereof entitled to the benefits of this Section 2(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such Registration Statement.
(b)
 
Piggy-back Registration Rights
.  If the Company at any time proposes or is required to register any of its securities under the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities or Blue Sky laws on a form which permits inclusion of Transfer Restricted Securities, it will each such time give written notice to all Holders of then existing Transfer Restricted Securities of its intentions to do so. Upon the written request of any such Holder given within 20 days after receipt of any such notice, the Company will use its best efforts to cause all such Transfer Restricted Securities which such Holders shall have requested be registered to be registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or blue sky laws all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or other disposition by such Holders of the Transfer Restricted Securities so registered; provided, however, if the offering proposed to be made is to be an underwritten public offering, and the managing underwriters of such public offering furnish a written opinion that the total amount of securities to be included in such offering would exceed the maximum amount of Securities (as specified in such opinion) which can be marketed without materially and adversely affecting such offering, then the relative rights to participate in such offering of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities, Holders of other securities having the right to include such securities in such registration, and the Company shall be in the following order of priority:
First:  The Person or Persons (including the Company in the case of an offering initiated by the Company) requesting such registration shall be entitled to participate in accordance with the relative priorities, if any, as shall exist among them; and then
Second:  The Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities and the holders of securities of the Company which have a right to include such securities in such registration shall be entitled to participate pro rata among themselves in accordance with the number of outstanding shares of Transfer Restricted Securities which each such Holder shall have requested be registered and the number of outstanding securities of the Company which a holder thereof shall have requested be registered; and then
Third:  If such registration shall have been requested by a Person or Persons other than the Company, the Company shall be entitled to include securities in such registration.
No registrations of Transfer Restricted Securities under this Section 2(b) shall relieve the Company of its obligation to effect registrations under Section 2(a) hereof, or shall constitute a registration request by any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities under Section 2(a).
(c)
 
Suspension of Registration Statement
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2, the Company may, by delivering written notice to the Holders, defer and suspend the filing of any Registration Statement covering Transfer Restricted Securities at any time if (i) the Company is in possession of material non-public information, (ii) the Company determines (based on advice of counsel) that such prohibition is necessary in order to avoid a requirement to disclose such material non-public information and (iii) the Company determines in good faith that disclosure of such material non-public information would have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its stockholders;
provided, however,
that upon the public disclosure by the Company of the material non-public information described in clause (i) of this paragraph, the suspension of the filing of the Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 2(c) shall cease and the Company shall promptly comply with Section 3(b) hereof.

3.                
Registration Procedures
In connection with the Companys registration obligations pursuant to Section 2 above, the Company shall in compliance with the time frames set forth above:
(a)
 
prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to such Transfer Restricted Securities and use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective (unless it shall have become automatically effective upon filing) and to keep such Registration Statement effective until such time as none of such Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and provide all requisite financial statements required for such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein. Upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement; the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration Statement, (1) in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and (2) in the case of clauses (A) and (B), use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective (unless it shall have become automatically effective upon filing) and such Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purpose(s) as soon as practicable thereafter;
(b)
 
prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the applicable period as specified in Section 2 hereof; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Securities Act or of the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, and (iv) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time the SEC shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time;
(d)
 
furnish to any underwriters and each selling Holder named in any Registration Statement or Prospectus before filing with the SEC, copies of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus included therein or any amendments or supplements to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such Registration Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and comment of such Persons in connection with such sale, if any, for a period of at least five Business Days, and the Company will not file any such Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to any such Registration Statement (including all such documents incorporated by reference) to which any such Person, shall reasonably object within five Business Days after the receipt thereof. A selling Holder shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing only if such Registration Statement, amendment, or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or omission or fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act;
(e)
 
promptly following the filing of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement, provide copies of such document to any underwriter and the selling Holders, make the Companys representatives available for discussion of such document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such document prior to the filing thereof as such Persons, reasonably may request.
(f)
 
make available at reasonable times for inspection by any underwriters and the selling Holders, and any attorney or accountant retained by Persons, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and cause the Companys officers, directors and employees to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by any Persons, attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto subsequent to the filing thereof and prior to its effectiveness;
(g)
 
if requested by any underwriter or selling Holders, promptly include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as such underwriter or selling Holders, may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the Plan of Distribution of the Transfer Restricted Securities; and make all required filings of such supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company is notified of the matters to be included therein;
(h)
 
furnish to any underwriter and each selling Holder, without charge, at least one copy of the Registration Statement, as first filed with the SEC, and of each amendment thereto, including all documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits (including exhibits incorporated therein by reference);

(j)
 
make such representations and warranties and take all such other actions in connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, and, at or prior to each closing of such sale, the Company shall:

a customary certificate signed on behalf of the Company by (x) the President or any Vice President and (y) a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company confirming, as of the date thereof, the matters similar to those covered in an officers certificate to underwriters in connection with primary underwritten offerings and such other similar matters as the Holders may reasonably request;

Without limiting the foregoing, such counsel may state further that such counsel assumes no responsibility for, and has not independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements, notes and schedules and other financial data included in any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement or the related Prospectus; and
(3)

(D)
 
deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by any underwriter or any of the selling Holders to evidence compliance with
clause (A) above.
The above shall be done at each closing, and if at any time the representations and warranties of the Company contemplated in (A)(1) above cease to be true and correct, the Company shall so advise any underwriter and the selling Holders promptly and if requested by such Persons, shall confirm such advice in writing;
(k)
 
prior to any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, to register or qualify, or cooperate with any underwriter and the selling Holders, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the selling Holders may reasonably request and as reasonably required to permit the resale of such Transfer Restricted Securities in such jurisdictions and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement;

(n)
 
subject to Section 3(c)(iv), if any fact or event contemplated by Section 3(c)(iv) above shall exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder and underwriter and (ii) each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder or underwriter (any of the persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a 
controlling person
) and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of any Holder, underwriter or any controlling person (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an 
Indemnified Person
), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including without limitation and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any Indemnified Person) directly or indirectly caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance, upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders expressly for use therein.
In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought against any Indemnified Person with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company pursuant to the preceding paragraph, such Indemnified Person (or the Indemnified Person controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the Company upon the request of such Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceedings (provided, that the failure to promptly give such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent the Company was actually prejudiced by such failure). Such Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the such Indemnified Person, unless (i) the employment
of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Person and the Company, and such Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense) it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for such Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons. The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Companys prior written consent, and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.
(b)
 
Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, officers, and any person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and its officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Holder shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Holder, its directors or officers or such controlling persons) and the Company shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph. In no event shall any Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the total proceeds (net of brokerage commissions) received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement.
(c)
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) hereof (other than by reason of
exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Person, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Person, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Indemnified Person and the parties relative intent, knowledge and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 6(a), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to the sale of its Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(c) are several in proportion to the respective shares of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
The indemnity, contribution and expense reimbursement obligations of the Company hereunder shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have under the Retirement Agreement or hereunder. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive so long as Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, notwithstanding any transfer or sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities by any Holder or any termination of this Agreement or the Retirement Agreement.
7.

EXHIBIT 4.2(C)
August , 2006
Loews Corporation
667 Madison Avenue
New York, New York 10021-8087
Attn:  General Counsel
Gentlemen:
I am providing this opinion as Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of CNA Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Series H Cumulative Preferred Stock Retirement Agreement (the Retirement Agreement), dated as of August 1, 2006, by and between the Company and Loews Corporation (Loews), pursuant to which the Company will purchase all of the Companys Series H Cumulative Preferred Stock, no par value per share, owned by Loews and, in consideration for which, the Company will issue and sell to Loews 7,863,258 shares (the Shares) of the Companys common stock, $2.50 par value per share, and pay $[________] in cash. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings provided for such terms in the Retirement Agreement.
In connection with the foregoing, I have examined the minute books and stock records of the Company; the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company; copies of the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the sale of the Shares. In addition, I have reviewed such documents and instruments, investigated such matters of law and have conferred with such officers and directors of the Company and have ascertained or verified to my satisfaction, such additional facts with respect to the Company which I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
In connection with this opinion, I have examined originals, or copies identified to my satisfaction as being true copies, of the following documents:
(a)
 
The Retirement Agreement; and
(b)
 
The Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement), dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company and Loews.
The Retirement Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are hereinafter referred to collectively as the Agreements.
I do not express any opinion as to any matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of Illinois, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
Based upon and qualified by the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
        
                 (i)  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; and
 
                 (ii) The Shares have been duly authorized and will, when issued and sold by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid and nonasessable; and 
 
                 (iii) The Agreements have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and
 
                 (iv) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Agreements will not contravene the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or, to my knowledge, any provision of applicable law; and
 
                 (v) The Agreements constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except, in each case, as may be limited by (i) any applicable bankrupty, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, equitable subordination, readjustment of debt and other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, public policy, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief (regardless of whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (iii) public policy considerations which, among other things, limit or restrict any agreement of any party to the Agreements relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation of costs, expenses or liabilities incurred by any indemnified person in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreements.
 
This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Agreement and is for the sole benefit of the addressee hereto in connection with the above-described matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation or quoted, filed with any government authority or other regulatory agency or otherwise circulated or used for any other purpose without my prior consent. This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein; no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated in this opinion. This opinion is rendered on the date hereof and I have no continuing obligation hereunder to inform you of changes of law or fact subsequent to the date hereof or facts of which I become aware after the date hereof.
 
Very truly yours,
