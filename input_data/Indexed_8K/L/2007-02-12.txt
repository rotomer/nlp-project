Page 1 of 6
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With 2005
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the fourth quarter of 2006 amounted to $609.4 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to $46.0 million, or $0.08 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved results at the Companys 89% owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation and the Companys 54% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., partially offset by a decrease in the share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock, due to the sale of additional Carolina Group stock in August and May 2006.
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains of $96.5 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment losses of $49.0 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year.
Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $137.1 million, or $1.26 per Carolina Group share, compared to $81.6 million, or $1.11 per Carolina Group share in the comparable period of the prior year.
The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock was due to an increase in Lorillard Inc. net income
primarily driven by higher unit sales, and reflects an increase in the number of Carolina Group shares outstanding. The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 amounted to $4.9
 
billion, compared to $4.1 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With 2005
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2006 amounted to $2,074.9 million, or $3.75 per share, compared to $960.3 million, or $1.72 per share, in the prior year. The results for the year ended December 31, 2005 included catastrophe losses at CNA of $304.8 million (after tax and minority interest) including the impact from Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, Rita, Dennis and Ophelia and a benefit of $136.5 million related to a federal income tax settlement due primarily to net refund interest and the release of federal income tax reserves at CNA. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved results at CNA and Diamond Offshore, partially offset by a decrease in the share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock, as discussed above.
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains of $68.6 million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment losses of $10.3 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year.
Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2006 was $416.4 million, or $4.46 per Carolina Group share, compared to $251.3 million, or $3.62 per Carolina Group share in the prior year.
The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock was due to an increase in Lorillard Inc. net income
driven by higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction to net sales), increased unit sales, and reflects an increase in the number of Carolina Group shares outstanding.

Consolidated revenues for the year ended 2006 amounted to $17.9 billion, compared to $16.0 billion in the prior year.
At December 31, 2006, there were 544,203,457 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 108,325,806
 
shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding.

Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
The Company has two classes of common stock: (i) Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Companys assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Companys subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and (ii) Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Companys remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group stock.
