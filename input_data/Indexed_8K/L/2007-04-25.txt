Management of the registrant has determined to recommend that the registrants Board of Directors (Board) adopt two amendments to the registrants By-Laws. The first amendment would establish a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections, requiring that a nominee receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected to the Board. Contested elections would continue to use the plurality vote standard. Under the majority voting standard, any incumbent director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast would be required to offer his or her resignation to the Board. The Board would then establish a committee to consider any such resignations and make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board would publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days of the certification of the election results.
The second By-law amendment would set a range for the number of directors constituting the entire Board at between 7 and 15 and provide that the range could not be changed except by a vote of shareholders. The Board would have flexibility to increase or decrease the size of the Board within the range without shareholder approval.
If adopted by the registrants Board, these amendments would be effective for the registrants 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
