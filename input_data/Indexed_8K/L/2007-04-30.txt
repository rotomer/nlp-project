Page 1 of 6
Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the first quarter of 2007 amounted to $650.7 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to $473.4 million, or $0.85 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income reflects improved results at the Companys 89% owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation and the Companys 51% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., and net investment gains described below, partially offset by a decrease in the share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock, due to the sale of Carolina Group stock in August and May of 2006.
Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains of $75.0 million (after tax and minority interest) in the first quarter of 2007 compared to net investment losses of $3.6 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The results for the first quarter of 2007 included a gain of $89.2 million (after tax) related to a reduction in the Companys ownership interest in Diamond Offshore from the conversion of Diamond Offshores 1.5% convertible debt into Diamond Offshore common stock.
Net income per share of Carolina Group stock for the first quarter of 2007 was $1.08 per share, compared to $0.86 per share in the comparable period of the prior year.
The increase in net income attributable to Carolina Group stock was due to an increase in Lorillard, Inc. net income primarily from
higher effective unit prices resulting from the December 2006 price increase and lower promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction to net sales), partially offset by a 0.9% reduction in unit sales volume.
 
The Company is issuing a separate press release reporting the results of the Carolina Group for the first quarter of 2007.
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2007 amounted to $4.7
 
billion, compared to $4.2 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
At March 31, 2007, there were 537,020,587 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 108,436,023
 
shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2007, the Company purchased 7,261,449 shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $314.0 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
The Company has two classes of common stock: (i) Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Companys assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Companys subsidiary Lorillard, Inc. and (ii) Loews common stock, representing the economic performance of the Companys remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group stock. At March 31, 2007, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 62.4% interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.
