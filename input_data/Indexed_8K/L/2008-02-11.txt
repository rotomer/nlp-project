Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, February 11, 2008Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR;CG) today reported consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the 2007 fourth quarter of $512 million, compared to $746 million in the 2006 fourth quarter. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2,489 million, compared to $2,491 million in the prior year.
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:
Page 1 of 6
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with 2006
    Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the fourth quarter of 2007 amounted to $384 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $609 million, or $1.11 per share, in the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in net income reflects reduced investment income and decreased results at the Companys 51% owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., primarily due to additional tax expense as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings. Net income in 2007 reflects the July 31, 2007 acquisition, by the Companys newly formed subsidiary HighMount Exploration & Production LLC, of certain natural gas exploration and production assets from Dominion Resources, Inc.
 
    Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $53 million (after tax and minority interest) in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to net investment gains of $96 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year. The net investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2007 were primarily driven by $167 million (after tax and minority interest) of other-than-temporary impairment losses at the Companys 89% owned subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation.
 
    Net income per share of Carolina Group stock for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.18 per share, compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. The decrease in net income is primarily due to a charge of $46 million, after taxes, related to litigation, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate as compared to 2006.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 amounted to $4.6billion, compared to $4.8 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with 2006
    Net income attributable to Loews common stock in 2007 amounted to $1,956 million, or $3.65 per share, compared to $2,075 million, or $3.75 per share, in the prior year. The decrease in net income reflects reduced investment income, reduced results at CNA and a decrease in the share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock, due to the sale of Carolina Group stock in August and May of 2006, partially offset by higher results from Lorillard, Inc.
    Net income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment losses of $67 million (after tax and minority interest) in 2007 compared to net investment gains of $69 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year. The net investment losses in 2007 were primarily driven by $428 million (after tax and minority interest) of other-than-temporary impairment losses at CNA which were partially offset by a gain of $93 million (after tax) related to a reduction in the Companys ownership interest in Diamond Offshore from the conversion of Diamond Offshores 1.5% convertible debt into Diamond Offshore common stock.
    Net income per share of Carolina Group stock for 2007 was $4.91 per share, compared to $4.46 per share in the prior year. The increase in net income is primarily due to higher effective unit prices resulting from price increases in December 2006 and September 2007, lower sales promotion expenses and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in expenses for the State Settlement Agreements and a charge related to litigation.

     Consolidated revenues in 2007 amounted to $18.4billion, compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year.
 
    At December 31, 2007, there were 529,683,628 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 108,459,141shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company purchased 14,789,949 shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $672 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
 
    The Company has two classes of common stock: (i) Carolina Group stock, a tracking stock intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of the Companys assets and liabilities, called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Companys subsidiary Lorillard; and (ii) Loews common stock, which represents the economic performance of the Companys remaining assets, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by Carolina Group stock. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represented a 62.4% interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group.
    On December 17, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to spin-off its entire ownership interest in Lorillard to holders of Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock in a tax-free transaction, as a result of which the Carolina Group, and all of the Carolina Group stock, would be eliminated and Lorillard would become a separate publicly traded company.
 
    The transaction would be accomplished by the Company through its (i) redemption of all outstanding Carolina Group stock in exchange for shares of Lorillard common stock, with holders of Carolina Group stock receiving one share of Lorillard common stock for each share of Carolina Group stock they own, and (ii) disposition of its remaining Lorillard common stock in an exchange offer for shares of outstanding Loews common stock, or as a pro rata dividend to the holders of Loews common stock.
    Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions, as described in the Loews press release, dated December 17, 2007, a copy of which is posted on the Companys website.

Exhibit 99.2
    NEW YORK, February 11, 2008Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR) today reported Carolina Group net income for the 2007 fourth quarter of $206 million, compared to $220 million in the 2006 fourth quarter. The decrease in net income is primarily due to a charge of $46 million, after taxes, related to litigation, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate as compared to 2006 due primarily to the statutory increase in the tax benefit related to the manufacturers deduction and resolution of certain state tax uncertainties.
    Net income per share of Carolina Group stock (NYSE:CG) for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.18, compared to $1.26 in the comparable period of the prior year. Carolina Group stock represented a 62.4% and 62.3% economic interest in the Carolina Group for the three months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Net sales for the Carolina Group were $957 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $937 million in the 2006 fourth quarter. Domestic unit volume decreased 4.3% in the 2007 fourth quarter compared to the 2006 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2006 was favorably impacted by increased wholesale purchases in anticipation of an industry price increase.
    Carolina Group net income for the year ended 2007 was $855 million, compared to $760 million for the year ended 2006. The increase in net income is primarily due to higher effective unit prices resulting from price increases in December 2006 and September 2007 and lower sales promotion expenses, and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in expenses for the State Settlement Agreements and the fourth quarter charge related to litigation. The effective tax rate was lower in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to the statutory increase in the tax benefit related to the manufacturers deduction and resolution of certain state tax uncertainties.

Net income per share of Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2007 was $4.91, compared to $4.46 in the prior year. Carolina Group stock represented a 62.4% and 54.8% economic interest in the Carolina Group for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Net sales for the Carolina Group were $3.969 billion in 2007, compared to $3.755 billion in the prior year. Domestic unit volume decreased 0.8% in 2007 compared to 2006, whereas the industry declined by approximately 5%.
    Results of operations of the Carolina Group include interest expense on notional intergroup debt of $9 million, $16 million, $48 million and $71 million, net of taxes, for the three months and years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, $424 million principal amount of notional intergroup debt was outstanding.
    The Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of the Companys assets and liabilities, referred to as the Carolina Group, principally consisting of the Companys subsidiary Lorillard, Inc.

The purpose of this financial information is to provide investors with additional information to use in analyzing the results of operations and financial condition of the Carolina Group, and this financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information of Loews Corporation.
    As of December 31, 2007 there were 108,459,141 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding, representing a 62.4% economic interest. Depending on market conditions, the Company, for the account of the Carolina Group, from time to time may purchase shares of Carolina Group stock in the open market or otherwise.
    On December 17, 2007, Loews announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to spin-off its entire ownership interest in Lorillard to holders of Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock in a tax-free transaction, as a result of which the Carolina Group, and all of the Carolina Group stock, would be eliminated and Lorillard would become a separate publicly traded company.
    The transaction would be accomplished by Loews through its (i) redemption of all outstanding Carolina Group stock in exchange for shares of Lorillard common stock, with holders of Carolina Group stock receiving one share of Lorillard common stock for each share of Carolina Group stock they own, and (ii) disposition of its remaining Lorillard common stock in an exchange offer for shares of outstanding Loews common stock or as a pro rata dividend to the holders of Loews common stock.
