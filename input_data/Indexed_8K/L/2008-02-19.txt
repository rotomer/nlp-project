Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, December 17, 2007
Loews Corporation (NYSE:LTR; CG) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to spin off its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. to holders of its Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock in a tax free transaction.  As a result of the transaction, Lorillard, presently a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews, would become a separate publicly traded company.
This transaction is consistent with our unrelenting focus on long-term value creation,
said James S. Tisch, Chief Executive Officer of Loews.  A spin-off of Lorillard will benefit both companies as well as the holders of Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock.
The transaction would be accomplished through the following steps:
Loews currently has two classes of common stock outstanding: Carolina Group stock, which is intended to reflect the economic performance of a group of assets and liabilities called the Carolina Group, principally consisting of Lorillard and its subsidiaries; and Loews common
1
stock, representing the economic performance of the remaining assets of Loews, including the interest in the Carolina Group not represented by out
standing Carolina Group stock.
Loews expects that Lorillard
s common stock will be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the spin-off, Martin L. Orlowsky will continue to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of Lorillard, and Lorillard
s corporate headquarters will continue to be in
Greensboro
,
North Carolina
.
Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions including receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion of tax counsel as to the tax-free nature of the transaction, Securities and Exchange Commission clearance, the absence of any material changes or developments, final approval by the Loews Board of Directors and market conditions.
Approval by shareholders of Loews is not required. The spin-off is expected to be completed in mid-2008.
This press release does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.
