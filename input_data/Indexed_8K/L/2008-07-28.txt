Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, July 28, 2008Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported income from continuing operations for the 2008 second quarter of $511 million, or $1.00 per share, compared to $422 million, or $0.78 per share, in the 2007 second quarter. Income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $920 million, or $1.77 per share, compared to $983 million, or $1.82 per share, in the prior year.
In June of 2008, the Company disposed of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. through the redemption of Carolina Group stock in exchange for Lorillard common stock and an exchange of our remaining Lorillard common stock for Loews common stock, collectively referred to as the Separation. The Carolina Group and Carolina Group stock have been eliminated and Lorillards results of operations and the gain on disposal have been classified as discontinued operations.
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews common stock and our former Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:

Income from Continuing Operations
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 Compared with 2007
The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects higher dayrates and utilization at Diamond Offshore, increased gas transportation revenues at Boardwalk Pipeline, the operations of HighMount which was acquired in July of 2007, and an increase in equity earnings of a joint venture at Loews Hotels. These increases were partially offset by a decline in results at CNA reflecting lower net investment income, decreased current accident year underwriting results and increased catastrophe losses.
Income from continuing operations includes net investment losses of $64 million (after tax and minority interest) in the second quarter of 2008 compared to net investment losses of $58 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year.
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2008 amounted to $3.9billion, compared to $3.5 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 Compared with 2007
 
The decline in income from continuing operations primarily reflects a decline in results at CNA, and the increased investment losses discussed below. These decreases were partially offset by improved results at Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline, HighMount and Loews Hotels.
Income from continuing operations includes net investment losses of $93 million (after tax and minority interest) in the first half of 2008 compared to net investment gains of $17 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. The 2007 investment gains included $92 million (after tax) related to a reduction in the Companys ownership interest in Diamond Offshore from the conversion of Diamond Offshores 1.5% convertible debt into Diamond Offshore common stock.
Consolidated revenues in the first half of 2008 amounted to $7.5billion, compared to $7.2 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
At June 30, 2008, there were 436,267,871 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, as part of the Separation the Company acquired 93,492,857 shares of Loews common stock in exchange for 65,445,000 shares of Lorillard common stock. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
