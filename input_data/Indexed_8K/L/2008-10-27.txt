Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, October 27, 2008Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported a loss from continuing operations for the 2008 third quarter of $144 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $309 million, or $0.58 per share, in the 2007 third quarter. Income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $776 million, or $1.58 per share, compared to $1,292 million, or $2.40 per share, in the comparable period of the prior year.
Net income (loss) and earnings (losses) per share information attributable to Loews common stock and our former Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
Investments in Subsidiaries
To assist our CNA subsidiary in strengthening the statutory capital of its principal insurance subsidiary Continental Casualty Company, which has been adversely impacted by the ongoing disruption in the capital markets, the Company agreed to purchase $1.25 billion of a new series of non-voting cumulative senior preferred stock from CNA. The new preferred stock will accrue cumulative dividends at the rate of 10% per annum, payable quarterly, for the first five years after issuance, with the dividend rate resetting thereafter and on each subsequent five year anniversary to the higher of 10% or the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate at such time plus 7%. No dividends may be declared on CNAs common stock while the new preferred stock is outstanding. CNA will use $1.0 billion of the proceeds from the new preferred stock to increase the statutory surplus of Continental Casualty Company. The Company expects to complete the purchase of the new preferred stock during the fourth quarter of 2008, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Companys Board of Directors also approved a commitment to purchase up to $1.0 billion of equity securities from its Boardwalk Pipeline subsidiary to facilitate the funding of the anticipated costs to complete its pipeline expansion projects. The Company would provide that equity capital to the extent that external funds are not available to Boardwalk Pipeline on acceptable terms. Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates that it will require a portion of this equity capital prior to the end of this year and the balance during the first half of 2009.
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 Compared with 2007
The loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008 primarily resulted from a decline in results at CNA reflecting higher net investment losses described below, a $145 million (after tax and minority interest) increase in catastrophe losses primarily from hurricanes and a reduction in investment income reflecting losses from limited partnership investments. Investment income at the holding company also included losses in 2008, as compared to gains in the prior year period. These declines were partially offset by significantly improved results at Diamond Offshore due to higher dayrates in 2008 and improved results at HighMount and Boardwalk Pipeline. Results in 2007 also included a $96 million charge at CNA (after tax and minority interest) in connection with a settlement of an arbitration proceeding related to a run-off book of business.
Net investment losses included in loss from continuing operations amounted to $379 million (after tax and minority interest) in the third quarter of 2008 compared to net investment losses of $32 million (after tax and minority interest) in the comparable period of the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, the Company recorded net realized investment losses of $178 million related to securities issued by Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, $58 million related to securities issued by Washington Mutual, $57 million related to securities issued by Icelandic banks and $21 million related to securities issued by American International Group.
Consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2008 amounted to $3.0billion, compared to $3.5 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
 
 
 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 Compared with 2007
The decline in income from continuing operations primarily reflects a decline in results at CNA, the increased investment losses and the reduced investment income discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by improved results at Diamond Offshore, HighMount and Boardwalk Pipeline.
Consolidated revenues in the first nine months of 2008 amounted to $10.5billion, compared to $10.7 billion in the comparable period of the prior year.
 
Discontinued Operations
In June 2008, the Company disposed of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. through the redemption of Carolina Group stock in exchange for Lorillard common stock and an exchange of our remaining Lorillard common stock for Loews common stock, collectively referred to as the Separation. The Carolina Group and Carolina Group stock have been eliminated. The Company also sold Bulova Corporation in January 2008. Bulova and Lorillards results of operations and the gain on disposal have been classified as discontinued operations.
At September 30, 2008, there were 436,088,567 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the nine months ended September 30, 2008, as part of the Separation the Company acquired 93,492,857 shares of Loews common stock in exchange for 65,445,000 shares of Lorillard common stock. In addition, the Company repurchased 314,000 shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $12 million in the three months ended September 30, 2008. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
