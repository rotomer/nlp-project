Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, February 9, 2009Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) today reported a loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $182 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $1,587 million, or $2.96 per share, in 2007. The Company reported a loss from continuing operations for the 2008 fourth quarter of $958 million, or $2.20 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $295 million, or $0.56 per share, in the 2007 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter and full year of 2008 include the following:
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 amounted to $4.5 billion compared to $2.5 billion for 2007. Net income includes a tax-free non-cash gain of $4.3 billion related to the separation of Lorillard and an after tax gain of $75 million from the sale of Bulova Corporation reported as discontinued operations.
 
 
 
 
Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share information attributable to Loews common stock and our former Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:
 
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with 2007
Higher investment losses and lower investment income at CNA contributed to the loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008. Investment income at the holding company also included losses in 2008, as compared to gains in the comparable period of the prior year. The prolonged and severe disruptions in the debt and equity markets, including among other things, widening of credit spreads, bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions as well as the global economic downturn, resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in CNAs investment portfolio and declines in net investment income during 2008.
HighMounts results also contributed to the loss from continuing operations and include a non-cash impairment charge of $691 million ($440 million after tax) related to the carrying value of proved reserves, and a non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill of $482 million ($314 million after tax). These charges reflect declines in commodity prices and negative reserve revisions in proved reserve quantities based on a decline in commodity prices. There were no comparable charges in 2007.
These declines were partially offset by significantly improved results at Diamond Offshore.
 
 
 
 
 
Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with 2007
 
The loss from continuing operations primarily reflected a decline in results at CNA due to increased investment losses, lower net investment income and increased catastrophe losses of $169 million (after tax and minority interest) primarily from hurricanes, as compared to the prior year. Non-cash impairment charges related to HighMount and reduced investment income at the holding company also contributed to lower results in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by significantly improved results at Diamond Offshore.
Discontinued Operations
In June 2008, the Company disposed of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. through the redemption of Carolina Group stock in exchange for Lorillard common stock and an exchange of our remaining Lorillard common stock for Loews common stock. The Carolina Group and Carolina Group stock have been eliminated. The Company also sold Bulova Corporation in January 2008. Bulova and Lorillards results of operations and the gains on disposal have been classified as discontinued operations.
At December 31, 2008, there were 435,091,667 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2008, as part of the separation of Lorillard, the Company acquired 93,492,857 shares of Loews common stock in exchange for 65,445,000 shares of Lorillard common stock. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, the Company purchased 999,600 and 1,313,600 shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $21 million and $33 million, respectively. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
