NEW YORK, May 4, 2009Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported a Net loss for the 2009 first quarter of $647 million, or $1.49 per share, compared to Net income of $662 million, or $1.05 per share, in the 2008 first quarter. The first quarter of 2009 included the following:

Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations
Loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $647 million, or $1.49 per Loews common share, as compared to income from continuing operations of $409 million, or $0.77 per Loews common share, in the first quarter of 2008.
Results for 2009 reflect a non-cash impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($660 million after tax) related to the carrying value of HighMounts natural gas and oil properties. This charge reflects declines in commodity prices. There were no comparable charges in the prior year period.
Higher investment losses and lower investment income at CNA also contributed to the loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008. The continuing volatility in the capital markets and continued economic slowdown, resulted in realized losses in CNAs investment portfolio and a decline in net investment income during the first quarter of 2009.
These declines were partially offset by improved results at Diamond Offshore.
Discontinued Operations
In June 2008, the Company disposed of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. through the redemption of Carolina Group stock in exchange for Lorillard common stock and an exchange of our remaining Lorillard common stock for Loews common stock. The Carolina Group and Carolina Group stock have been eliminated. The Company also sold Bulova Corporation in January 2008. Lorillards results of operations and the gain on disposal of Bulova have been classified as discontinued operations.

At March 31, 2009, there were 435,159,670 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company purchased 329,500 shares of CNA common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $2 million.  Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
