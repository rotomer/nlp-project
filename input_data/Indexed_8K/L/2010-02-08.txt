Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, February 8, 2010Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported income from operations before investment losses for 2009 of $1,069 million compared to $572 million in 2008. Income from continuing operations for 2009 was $566 million, or $1.31 per share, compared to a loss of $182 million, or $0.38 per share, in 2008.  The Company reported income from continuing operations for the 2009 fourth quarter of $403 million, or $0.94 per share compared to a loss of $958 million, or $2.20 per share in the 2008 fourth quarter.
 
Book value per common share increased to $39.76 at December 31, 2009 as compared to $30.18 at December 31, 2008. The increase during the year was primarily driven by a $3.3 billion (after tax and noncontrolling interests) improvement in the fair value of our insurance subsidiarys fixed maturities investment portfolio reflecting a further narrowing of credit spreads that began in the second quarter of 2009.
 
Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share information attributable to Loews common stock and the former Carolina Group stock is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income from Continuing Operations
Three Months Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with 2008
 
Income from continuing operations primarily reflects improved net investment income and net investment gains at CNA Financial Corporation, compared to a loss from continuing operations in the prior year. Net investment income benefited from higher limited partnership results, partially offset by the impact of lower short-term interest rates. In addition, higher investment income from the holding company trading portfolio contributed to the improved results.
 
The prior year loss from continuing operations reflects a $440 million (after tax) non-cash impairment charge related to the carrying value of HighMount Exploration & Production LLCs natural gas and oil properties, reflecting negative revisions in proved reserve quantities as a result of declines in commodity prices; a $314 million (after tax) non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to HighMount; and other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses related to CNAs investment portfolio.
 
Income from continuing operations included net investment gains of $46 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to net investment losses of $282 million in the comparable prior year period. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 were driven by a $217 million realized investment gain from the sale of CNAs common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics, Inc. and decreased OTTI losses recognized in CNAs available-for-sale portfolio. The OTTI losses were primarily driven by the impact of difficult economic conditions on residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and by credit issues in the financial sector. Net investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were primarily driven by OTTI losses due to credit related issues.
Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with 2008
 
The increase in income from continuing operations in 2009 is primarily due to the reasons discussed in the three months comparison, partially offset by a non-cash impairment charge of $660 million (after tax) in 2009 related to the carrying value of HighMounts natural gas and oil properties, reflecting declines in commodity prices. Excluding impairment charges, HighMounts results declined over the prior year due to decreased production volumes and lower natural gas prices. Results at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP were lower primarily due to loss of revenues while remediating pipeline anomalies, and favorable one time transactions in 2008.
 
Net investment losses were $503 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2009, compared to losses of $754 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the gain from the sale of Verisk common stock holdings as discussed above and decreased OTTI losses recorded in 2009.
 
 
 
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In June of 2008, the Company disposed of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc. through the redemption of Carolina Group stock in exchange for Lorillard common stock and an exchange of our remaining Lorillard common stock for Loews common stock. The Carolina Group and Carolina Group stock have been eliminated. The Company also sold Bulova Corporation in January 2008. Lorillards results of operations and the gain on disposal of Lorillard and Bulova have been classified as discontinued operations.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At December 31, 2009, there were 425,070,322 shares of Loews common stock outstanding.
