Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, May 3, 2010Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the 2010 first quarter of $420 million, or $0.99 per share, compared to a net loss of $647 million, or $1.49 per share, in the 2009 first quarter. Income before investment gains (losses) for the 2010 first quarter was $409 million compared to a loss of $337 million in the 2009 first quarter.
Book value per share increased to $41.80 at March 31, 2010, compared to $39.76 at December 31, 2009.
Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
 
Income before net investment gains improved by $746 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the absence of a non-cash impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($660 million after tax) related to the carrying value of HighMount Exploration & Production LLCs natural gas and oil properties included in the prior year period. This charge reflected declines in commodity prices. In addition, higher investment income at CNA Financial Corporation primarily from improved performance in limited partnerships and fixed maturities contributed to the improvement, partially offset by decreased earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. reflecting lower operating income and increased interest expense.
 
Net income included net investment gains of $11 million (after tax and noncontrolling interest) in the first quarter of 2010 compared to net investment losses of $310 million in the
 
 
 
comparable prior year period. Net investment gains in the first quarter of 2010 reflect other-than-temporary impairment losses of $35 million (after tax and noncontrolling interest) compared to $359 million in the prior year period.
 
In April of 2010, HighMount sold its exploration and production assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan for approximately $330 million, subject to adjustment. Net proceeds from this sale of approximately $300 million were used to reduce outstanding debt under HighMounts term loans. Also in April of 2010, HighMount signed an agreement with another purchaser to sell its exploration and production assets located in the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama for approximately $210 million, subject to adjustment. HighMount expects to close this transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, during the second quarter of 2010, and to use the net proceeds of approximately $190 million to further reduce outstanding debt under its term loans. These sales will not result in a material gain or loss.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At March 31, 2010, there were 419,733,029 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company purchased 5,387,600 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $197 million. From April 1, 2010 through April 28, 2010, the Company acquired an additional 1,245,900 shares of its common stock for $47 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
