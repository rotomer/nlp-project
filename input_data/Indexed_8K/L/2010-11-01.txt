Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, November 1, 2010Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the 2010 third quarter of $36 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to net income of $468 million, or $1.08 per share, in the 2009 third quarter. Third quarter 2010 results included a charge of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the previously announced Loss Portfolio Transfer agreement under which the Companys CNA Financial Corporation subsidiary ceded legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity Company. Excluding the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction, net income as adjusted for the third quarter 2010 amounted to $364 million as compared to $468 million.
 
Book value per share increased to $45.31 at September 30, 2010, compared to $43.53 at June 30, 2010 and $39.76 at December 31, 2009.
 
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared with 2009
 
Income from continuing operations, excluding the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction, amounted to $365 million as compared to $469 million. The decrease is primarily due to lower net investment income from reduced limited partnership income at CNA and lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. reflecting reduced utilization and the impact of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. Results in 2009 also included a $55 million gain (after tax and noncontrolling interests) at CNA from a settlement that resolved litigation related to the placement of personal accident reinsurance. These declines were partially offset by improved results from net investment gains and increased favorable net prior year development at CNA.
 
Income from continuing operations included net investment gains of $37 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the third quarter of 2010 compared to net investment losses of $61 million in the comparable prior year period. Net investment gains in the third quarter of 2010 were driven by net trading activity and lower other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses at CNA compared to the prior year period.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared with 2009
 
Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2010 amounted to $841 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), compared to $163 million for the prior year period. The prior year period included a non-cash impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($660 million after tax) related to the carrying value of HighMount Exploration and Production LLCs natural gas and oil properties. This charge reflected declines in commodity prices. Excluding the prior year charge and the charge for CNAs Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction in the three months ended September 30, 2010 discussed above, results for the first nine months of 2010 improved due to significantly lower OTTI losses at CNA. The improvement was partially offset by reduced results as discussed in the three months comparison above.
 
Net investment gains amounted to $49 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the first nine months of 2010 compared to net investment losses of $549 million in the comparable prior year period. Net investment gains in the first nine months of 2010 reflected OTTI losses at CNA of $94 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) compared to $677 million in the comparable prior year period.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At September 30, 2010, there were 416.2 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, the Company purchased 2.3 million and 9.2 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $84 million and $337 million.
