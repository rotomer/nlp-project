Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, February 7, 2011Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for 2010 of $1.3 billion, or $3.07 per share, compared to net income of $564 million, or $1.30 per share, in 2009. Results for 2010 included a charge of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the previously reported Loss Portfolio Transfer Agreement under which the Companys CNA Financial Corporation subsidiary ceded legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity Company. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $466 million, or $1.12 per share, compared to net income of $403 million, or $0.94 per share, in the 2009 fourth quarter.
 
Book value per share amounted to $44.51 at December 31, 2010, compared to $45.31 at September 30, 2010 and $39.76 at December 31, 2009. The change during the year was partially driven by the impact of changing interest rates on the fair value of CNAs fixed maturities investment portfolio.
 
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with 2009
 
Income from continuing operations amounted to $466 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to $403 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase is primarily due to higher net investment income from limited partnerships, increased favorable net prior year development at CNA and improved results from the Companys trading portfolio. These increases were partially offset by net investment losses and lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. reflecting reduced utilization and the continued impact of the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Income from continuing operations included net investment losses of $22 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to net investment gains of $46 million in the comparable prior year period. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $217 million realized investment gain from the sale of CNAs common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics, Inc.  Excluding this prior year gain, results in 2010 improved due to lower other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses of $41 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to CNAs investment portfolio compared to $114 million in the prior year period.
Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with 2009
 
Income from continuing operations in 2010 amounted to $1.3 billion as compared to $566 million in 2009. The results in 2010 included a charge of $309 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer agreement.
 
Results for 2009 included a non-cash impairment charge of $660 million (after tax) related to the carrying value of HighMount Exploration and Production LLCs natural gas and oil properties. This charge reflected declines in commodity prices. Results in 2010 also benefitted from significantly lower OTTI losses and increased favorable net prior year development at CNA. These improvements were partially offset by reduced results at Diamond Offshore, as discussed above.
 
Net investment gains amounted to $27 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2010 compared to net investment losses of $503 million in 2009. Net investment gains in 2010 were driven by improvements in capital markets and reflected OTTI losses at CNA of $136 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests). Net investment losses in 2009 reflected OTTI losses at CNA of $791 million, which were driven by reduced valuations for residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities as well as credit issues in the financial sector.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At December 31, 2010, there were 414.5 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock for $68 million and for the full year, the Company purchased 11.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $405 million.
