Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, August 1, 2011Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the 2011 second quarter of $252 million, or $0.62 per share, as compared to $366 million, or $0.87 per share, in the 2010 second quarter. Income before net investment gains for the 2011 second quarter was $240 million, as compared to $365 million in the 2010 second quarter.
 
Book value per share increased to $46.81 at June 30, 2011 compared to $45.54 at March 31, 2011 and $44.51 at December 31, 2010.
 
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
Net income decreased primarily due to lower favorable net prior year development recorded by CNA Financial Corporation in 2011 than in 2010, as well as higher natural catastrophe losses in 2011. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. primarily due to an increase in utilization of high specification floaters.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
In the first six months of 2011, net income decreased as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower favorable net prior year development in 2011 than in 2010, and higher natural catastrophe losses in 2011 at CNA.
 
Net income included net investment gains of $24 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the first six months of 2011 as compared to net investment gains of $12 million in the comparable prior year period. Net investment gains for the six months ended June 30, 2011 were driven by net trading activity and lower other-than-temporary impairment losses at CNA as compared to the prior year period.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At June 30, 2011, there were 404.9 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company purchased 5.5 million and 9.9 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $228 million and $415 million. From July 1, 2011 to July 28, 2011, the Company purchased an additional 1.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $41 million.
