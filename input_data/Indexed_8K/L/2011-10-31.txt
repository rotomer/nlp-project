Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, October 31, 2011Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the 2011 third quarter of $162 million, or $0.40 per share, as compared to $36 million, or $0.09 per share, in the 2010 third quarter.
 
Book value per share increased to $47.75 at September 30, 2011 compared to $46.81 at June 30, 2011 and $44.51 at December 31, 2010.
 
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
Net income in third quarter of 2011 amounted to $162 million as compared to $36 million in the comparable period of 2010. The increase is primarily due to a $328 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interest) at CNA Financial Corporation in 2010 related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer (LPT) transaction under which CNA ceded legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities to National Indemnity Company. Excluding that charge, net income decreased due to lower investment income primarily from decreased limited partnership results and higher natural catastrophe losses at CNA in 2011 as compared to 2010. In addition, parent company investment income decreased due to lower performance of equity investments. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
Net income for the first nine months of 2011 amounted to $796 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) as compared to $822 million in the prior year period. Excluding the charge related to the LPT transaction, results for the first nine months of 2011 decreased primarily due to the reasons discussed above in the three month comparison and a lower level of favorable net prior year development recorded by CNA in 2011 than in 2010.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At September 30, 2011, there were 397.4 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company purchased 7.5 million and 17.4 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $275 million and $690 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
