Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, February 6, 2012Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $268 million, or $0.67 per share, as compared to $466 million, or $1.12 per share in the 2010 fourth quarter. Net income for 2011 amounted to $1.1 billion, or $2.63 per share, as compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.07 per share, in 2010. Results in 2010 included a charge of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the previously reported Loss Portfolio Transfer agreement involving the Companys CNA Financial Corporation subsidiary.
 
Book value per share increased to $47.49 at December 31, 2011 as compared to $44.51 at December 31, 2010.
 
Net income and earnings per share information attributable to Loews Corporation is summarized in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $268 million as compared to $466 million in the comparable period of 2010. The decrease is primarily due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of $57 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) at CNA in 2011 and a $104 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) increase in insurance reserves for its payout annuity business. The fourth quarter of 2011 also reflects lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and decreased results from the parent company trading portfolio due to lower performance of equity investments.
 
Net income also included net investment losses of $40 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to net investment losses of $22 million in the prior year period. Losses in the fourth quarter of 2011 included a loss of $21 million related to the termination of interest rate swaps from refinancing of long term debt.
Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with 2010
 
Net income in 2011 amounted to $1.1 billion as compared to $1.3 billion in 2010. Excluding the prior year charge of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction, net income for 2011 decreased $552 million primarily due to the reasons discussed above in the three month comparison as well as higher catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable net prior year development recorded by CNA in 2011 than in 2010.
 
Net income also included net investment losses of $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2011 as compared to net investment gains of $27 million in the prior year. Net investment losses in 2011 were primarily driven by lower gains on sales of securities partially offset by lower other-than-temporary impairment losses at CNA.
SHARE REPURCHASES
 
At December 31, 2011, there were 396.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2011, the Company purchased 0.8 million and 18.2 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $28 million and $718 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its and its subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
