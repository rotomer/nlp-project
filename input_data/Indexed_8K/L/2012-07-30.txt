CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS

Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Compared to 2011
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews adjusted net income in 2012 would have been $198 million, as compared to $250 million in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at CNA Financial Corporation and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP.
CNAs earnings increased primarily as a result of lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.
Diamond Offshores earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, a decrease in average dayrate, and an increase in contract drilling expenses reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain (after tax and noncontrolling interests) from the sale of five jack-up rigs in the second quarter of 2012.
Boardwalk Pipelines earnings increased primarily due to the contribution from Boardwalk HP Storage Company which was acquired in December 2011 as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Compared to 2011
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews adjusted net income in 2012 would have been $593 million, as compared to $629 million in the 2011 period. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings at Diamond Offshore and decreased parent company investment income, partially offset by higher earnings at CNA.
