Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, October 29, 2012Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) today reported net income for the 2012 third quarter of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the 2011 third quarter.

Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes after tax non-cash ceiling test impairment charges of $166 million and $336 million at HighMount Exploration & Production LLC related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties reflecting declines in natural gas and NGL prices.

CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2012 Compared to 2011
Income before net investment gains (losses) and impairment charges in 2012 was $339 million, as compared to $177 million in the 2011 third quarter. The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial Corporation and higher parent company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income and lower catastrophe losses. Increased investment income reflects improved performance of limited partnership investments.
Diamond Offshore's earnings decreased due to lower rig utilization and a decrease in average dayrate.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 Compared to 2011
Income before net investment gains and impairment charges in 2012 was $901 million, as compared to $782 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons discussed above in the three month comparison and improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, primarily due to the contribution from Boardwalk HP Storage Company which was acquired in December 2011 as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials.

At September 30, 2012, there were 393.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company purchased 2.2 million and 3.5 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $88 million and $139 million.
