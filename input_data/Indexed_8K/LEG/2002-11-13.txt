EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: NOVEMBER 13, 2002 LEGGETT ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER DIVIDEND, FUTURE RETIREMENT OF CFO, AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW BOARD MEMBER Carthage, MO -- The Board of Directors of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated today declared a fourth quarter dividend of $.13 per share, unchanged from last quarter's dividend. The dividend will be paid on January 15, 2003 to shareholders of record on December 13, 2002. Quarterly dividends declared in 2002 total $.50 per share, an increase of 4% from 2001. Consistent cash flow, a conservative capital policy, and the success of management's long-term growth strategy have allowed Leggett to sustain an exceptional 31-year record of annual dividend increases. Since 1971 the quarterly dividend has grown at a 15.1% compound annual rate. - - - - - - - - - - The company also announced that Michael A. Glauber, Leggett's long-time Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, informed the company of his desire to retire effective in April of 2003. Felix Wright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had this to say, "For thirty-three years Mike has been an outstanding partner and key contributor to Leggett's growth and success. Mike's keen financial expertise, candor, and eye on the bottom line have helped make Leggett the company it is. We will not only miss Mike's business acumen, but will also greatly miss the camaraderie and daily personal interaction we've shared for so long." In April 2003, Matthew C. Flanigan will become Leggett's Chief Financial Officer; he will work closely with Mike Glauber over the next several months to effect a seamless transition. Matt is currently President of the company's Office Furniture Components Group, and is also a Vice President of the corporation. A native of Carthage, Missouri, Matt joined Leggett's operations staff in 1997, returning home after time away for college and early career positions. Prior to joining Leggett, Matt's career included ten years with Societe Generale, where he advanced through increasingly responsible positions, culminating in his appointment as First Vice President and Manager of Societe Generale's Dallas, Texas operations. Matt is a cum laude graduate in finance from the University of Missouri. - - - - - - - - - - The company also announced the election of Judy C. Odom to the Board of Directors, filling the vacancy created by expansion of the Board to 13 members. Ms. Odom most recently served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Software Spectrum, Inc., a company she co-founded in 1983. She served in this position until earlier this year, when Software Spectrum merged with Level 3 Communications. Under her leadership, Software Spectrum became a leading global supplier of personal computer software and technology services, and a Fortune 1000 company. From 1977 to 1985 Ms. Odom served at the national accounting firm of Grant Thornton and became one of the first women at that firm to be named an audit partner.
