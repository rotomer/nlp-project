INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated April 16, 2003

EXHIBIT 99.1 [LETTERHEAD OF LEGGETT & PLATT] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: APRIL 16, 2003 LEGGETT REPORTS $.25 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS Carthage, MO, April 16 --- . First quarter 2003 EPS at $.25, in line with prior guidance. . Earnings are 3 cents, or 11%, lower than 1Q 2002 primarily due to higher energy costs. . 1Q revenues of $1.04 billion; organic sales growth of 1.5% versus 1Q 2002. . $377 million of cash on hand; net debt-to-cap below 25%. . 2003 guidance narrowed: EPS of $1.15-$1.30, on 0%-4% organic sales growth. . 2Q 2003 guidance: EPS of $.27-$.32 on sales of $1.05-1.10 billion. Fortune 500 diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt reported first quarter earnings of $.25 per diluted share, in line with guidance issued earlier in the quarter. Higher energy costs impacted earnings by approximately 3 cents per share, and led to an 11% decline from 1Q 2002 earnings of $.28. Sales were $1.04 billion. Both total sales and same location sales increased 1.5% over the first quarter of 2002, as $15 million in sales from acquisitions were offset by revenue decreases arising from recent divestitures. Management Comments Felix E. Wright, Chairman and CEO said, "This was a challenging quarter. Despite sales growth and cost structure improvement, earnings per share declined about 11%. Energy costs played a large role, but are expected to become less of a factor as we move into the summer. "Consumer demand for bedding and residential furniture was lackluster this quarter. For the first time in over a year sales declined in our Residential Segment. In the Commercial Segment, demand for both retail store fixtures and commercial office furniture components remains weak. In contrast, the Aluminum Segment doubled earnings and posted a double-digit margin, as it continued to benefit from sales growth, market share gains, and efficiency improvements. "In February we announced a first quarter dividend of $.13 per share, an 8% increase over the same quarter one year earlier. At an indicated annual rate of $.52 per share (and a current yield of 2.6%), 2003 should mark 32 consecutive years of dividend increase for Leggett, at a compound annual growth rate of 15%. We believe this to be the best dividend record among the Fortune 500. "In March we issued $200 million of new debt, taking advantage of the current low interest rates, locking in a 4.7% rate on these 10-year notes. This was an opportunistic move, as we have no specific immediate need for the cash. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or refinancing of existing debt, stock repurchases, and/or the financing of future acquisitions." Second Quarter and Full Year Outlook Market demand, and its impact on sales revenue, remains the biggest single lever affecting Leggett's earnings. With the first quarter completed, the company is slightly narrowing its 2003 sales growth forecast (excluding acquisitions) to a range of zero to 4%. This sales range yields earnings guidance of $1.15-$1.30 per share for the full year.
Page 2 of 6 Typically, in the second quarter, Leggett sees about a $50 million sequential increase in sales (versus first quarter). All else being equal, this would equate to about a 5 cent per share sequential increase in earnings. Given current uncertainty about consumer sentiment and the underlying strength of the economy, it is difficult to accurately forecast second quarter sales. That said, the company anticipates sales between $1.05 and $1.10 billion for the second quarter. Based on this sales range, Leggett expects earnings of $.27-$.32 per share for the second quarter. Management will discuss these results at 8:00 a.m. Central (9am Eastern) on Thursday, April 17. The teleconference can be accessed (live or replay) from the Investor Relations section of Leggett's website at www.leggett.com. The dial-in number is (303) 262-2075. Second quarter results will be released on July 16, with a conference call on July 17. SEGMENT RESULTS - First Quarter 2003 (versus the same quarter one year ago) Residential Furnishings - Total sales decreased 0.7%. Same location sales decreased 1.4%, but were partially offset by acquisitions. EBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) decreased $12.2 million, or 20%, due to higher energy and raw material costs, reduced production (and lower overhead absorption), absence of last year's partial reversal of Canadian lumber duty accruals, and change in sales mix. Market demand for bedding components declined in the quarter, and is still down; however, demand for upholstered furniture components was basically unchanged from last year's strong first quarter levels. Many analysts believe there is pent up demand for furniture and bedding, as consumers have yet to fully furnish homes acquired in the last few years at historically low interest rates. Commercial Fixturing and Components - Total sales increased 1.0%, as acquisitions augmented the 0.3% increase in same location sales. Steep declines in market demand have moderated, as evidenced by the company's first same location growth quarter in over two years. Nevertheless, demand remains at very depressed levels as retailers, telecom customers, and brand product manufacturers continue to postpone spending for fixtures and displays. Some analysts believe that, once the economy recovers, there could be a significant wave of new spending because retailers have been postponing store fixture purchases (both for new stores and refurbishment of old stores) for over two years. Finally, market demand for office and contract furniture components remains soft. EBIT decreased $2.7 million, due in part to increased energy and raw material costs, and changes in product mix. Aluminum Products - Total sales decreased 1.5%. Same location sales increased 8.0%, but were more than offset by three recent divestitures. Following two years of reduced same location sales caused by decreased market demand, same location sales have now grown each of the last four quarters, at an average of 12.5%. Importantly, recent sales growth is attributable to market share gains, as overall market demand has not improved appreciably. The company divested three operations during 2002; these firms collectively had revenues of about $40 million annually, but did not contribute significantly to EBIT. EBIT increased $7.3 million for the quarter, or 118%, due to higher same location sales, absence of last year's obsolescence charges, and cost management efforts. Industrial Materials - Total sales increased 1.4%, as acquisitions more than offset a 2.7% decline in same location sales. EBIT declined $7.4 million, or 48%, due in large part to start up costs (of $5.1 million, as anticipated) at the Sterling Steel rod mill. Higher steel prices, higher energy costs, and lower production and sales also reduced EBIT. The reductions were partly offset by a $2.6 million gain on sale of a tube fabrication business. Specialized Products - Total sales increased $18.6 million, or 21.7%. Same location sales increased 20.8% in response to higher demand for both machinery and automotive components. EBIT increased $2.1 million, or 24%, with sales-related earnings increases partially offset by several small items, including sales mix and start up costs associated with production of wide-format digital printing equipment.

Page 6 of 6 REGULATION G REQUIREMENT: RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION CALCULATION OF "WORKING CAPITAL" AND "DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL" IN FINANCIAL SCHEDULES In the previous schedules, Working Capital excludes cash. In addition, in the Debt to Total Capital ratio, debt is reduced by the amount of cash on hand. The Company has a considerable amount of cash beyond its current needs. Because this cash is readily available to repay debt, the Company believes that these adjustments result in figures that more appropriately reflect its working capital position and financial leverage. Working Capital also excludes current debt (resulting in a higher working capital figure). The Debt to Total Capital calculation includes current debt (resulting in a higher debt figure). Current debt is viewed by the Company as part of total debt, and is treated in these calculations as if it were part of long term debt. The Company has traditionally refinanced current debt, and has sufficient credit facilities in place to do so. Due to the Company's current cash position, its intention is to repay the existing current debt at maturity; the debt is therefore classified on the Balance Sheet as current. The Company believes that these adjustments result in figures that more appropriately reflect its working capital position and financial leverage. The calculations are made as follows:
