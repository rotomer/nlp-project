INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated June 17, 2003

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: JUNE 17, 2003 LOWER SALES IMPACT LEGGETT'S EARNINGS Carthage, MO, June 17, 2003 . 2Q sales expected to be below prior guidance. . Energy costs continue to impact earnings. . 2Q EPS guidance reduced to range of 22-25 cents. . Full year organic sales growth expectation now -2% to +2%. . Full year EPS guidance reduced to $1.05-$1.20. Fortune 500 diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt announced that lower sales are expected to impact second quarter earnings. Previous guidance of 27 to 32 cents per share anticipated sales declines of 1% to 6% compared to a strong second quarter of 2002. Sales for the quarter are now expected to be below that range, and should lower earnings by at least a penny versus last guidance. In addition, continued higher energy costs are expected to reduce earnings by about a penny, and several smaller factors are also expected to lower earnings. Despite market share gains, continued weakness in many end markets are leading to a second quarter sales decline. Through the first 10 weeks of the quarter the company's consolidated same location sales were down 7%, with segment sales trends as follows: down 6% in Residential Furnishings; down 10% in Commercial Fixturing and Components; down 9% in Aluminum Products; down 17% in Industrial Materials; and up 3% in Specialized Products. Market demand, and its impact on sales revenue, remains the biggest single lever affecting Leggett's earnings. With this preliminary look at second quarter demand, the company is updating its full year sales guidance to a range of negative 2% growth to positive 2% (previous guidance was flat to up 4%). This sales range yields earnings guidance of $1.05-$1.20 per share for the full year (previously $1.15-$1.30). Management will discuss these events in a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Central (9am Eastern) on Wednesday, June 18. The webcast can be accessed (live or replay) from the Investor Relations section of Leggett's website at www.leggett.com. The dial-in number is (303) 262-2140; there is no password. Second quarter results will be released July 16, with a conference call on July 17.
