Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 8, 2004, the Board of Directors of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (the "Company") approved amendments to two of the Company's non-qualified executive deferred compensation programs in response to tax laws enacted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The amendments are intended to make the programs compliant with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A"). The Board authorized the Company to make such further changes as may become necessary after rules implementing Section 409A are promulgated.
 
A summary of the material modifications to each program is set forth below. The summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the program documents, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
A. Deferred Compensation Program
 
The Deferred Compensation Program (the "Program") is a non-qualified program established under the 1989 Flexible Stock Plan that allows certain key employees to forego receipt of salary, bonus and other compensation in exchange for a future payment of cash or Company equity. The equity alternative under the current Program is a discount stock option. Under the amended Program, discount stock options have been replaced with (i) at-market options with an initial face value five times the compensation foregone, and (ii) stock units (with dividend equivalents) accruing on a bi-weekly basis, or as compensation otherwise would have been paid, at a 20% discount to fair market value. The participants in the Program are directors, officers and employees of the Company, and as such, have a relationship to the Company.
 
 
B. Executive Stock Unit Program
 
The Executive Stock Unit Program (the "ESU Program") is a non-qualified retirement program established under the 1989 Flexible Stock Plan that allows more than 500 key employees to make pre-tax contributions to acquire Company stock at a 15% discount. Shares are credited to an employee's account as "stock units" where they accrue dividends. The Company matches 50% of the employee's contribution and may match another 50% if certain earnings objectives are met. Matching contributions are subject to vesting requirements. Stock units are converted to shares and issued at retirement, death or termination.
 
The Company elected to "freeze" the existing ESU Program with its current provisions and establish a new program for amounts deferred after December 31, 2004. We now refer to the separate programs as the Pre-2005 Executive Stock Unit Program and the 2005 Executive Stock Unit Program.

Such payment may be made in cash, by delivery of shares of Common Stock (held for at least 6 months) or a combination of cash and Common Stock. Any such Common Stock will be valued at the per share closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of exercise. No shares will be delivered in connection with an Option exercise unless all amounts required to satisfy tax and any other required withholdings have been paid to the Employer.

STOCK UNIT AND L&P CASH DEFERRALS
 
5.1 . An account will be established to track Stock Units for each Participant who elects a Stock Unit deferral. Compensation will be deferred on a bi-weekly basis or as Compensation otherwise would have been paid, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Any Lost Retirement Benefit will be credited to the Participant's account at year-end. All deferrals and Dividend Contributions to a Participant's account will be used to acquire Stock Units at a price equal to 80% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date such deferrals and Dividend Contributions are made.

Dividend Contributions
 
5.3 . Prior to distribution, Stock Units will be converted to the appropriate number of whole shares of Common Stock. The Company may withhold from such Common Stock any amount required to pay applicable taxes (at the Company's required withholding rate). Alternatively, the Participant may pay such taxes in cash if he elects to do so before the distribution date.
Stock Unit Distributions
 
Annual installment distributions will be made by January 31st of each calendar year following the calendar year of the initial distribution. Each annual distribution will be equal to the balance of Stock Units in the Participant's account divided by the number of payments remaining.
 
5.4 . L&P Cash Deferrals will bear interest at a rate established by the Committee. The interest will begin accruing on the date the Deferred Compensation would have been paid but for the deferral. Until the Committee determines otherwise, the Chief Financial Officer will determine the interest rates and the length of the deferral periods available to Participants.
Interest on L&P Cash Deferral
 
5.5 . The Participant will select the date or dates of payout and the form of distribution for Stock Unit and L&P Cash Deferrals on his Election form; provided, however, that the first payment date will not be earlier than two years after the Election is made or such other date as the Committee determines. The Committee may establish maximum deferral periods and maximum payout periods.
Payment Dates and Form of Distribution
 
The Participant may make a one-time election to extend the payout period or change the form of distribution for Stock Unit and L&P Cash Deferrals, not to exceed any maximum payout period established by the Committee. The election change must be made not less than 12 months before the first scheduled payment date designated in the original Election and must extend the first distribution payment by at least five years.
 
5.6 . If a Participant elects an L&P Cash Deferral, the Participant may later request that the Committee grant an Option or Stock Units in lieu of the L&P Cash Deferral. The Committee may, in its sole discretion and as permitted under applicable law, grant such conversion to the Participant on such date and upon such terms as the Committee determines. The Participant will forfeit all accrued interest of the L&P Cash Deferral if the Committee grants his request. Any such request must satisfy the conditions for a one-time election change specified in Section 5.5.
Convert L&P Cash Deferral to Option or Stock Units
 
5.7 . In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and as permitted under applicable law, authorize an early distribution of a Participant's vested L&P Cash Deferral or Stock Unit account.
Unforseeable Emergency
 
5.8 . The Company's obligation to a Participant for Stock Unit and L&P Cash Deferrals is a mere promise to pay shares or money in the future and the Participant will have the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
Unsecured Creditor
 
5.9 . The Committee and the Company's Secretary will make all determinations regarding benefits under the Program in accordance with ERISA.
Claims under ERISA
 
If a Participant believes he is entitled to receive a distribution under the Program and he does not receive such distribution, he must make a claim in writing to the Committee. The Committee will review the claim. If the claim is denied, the Committee will provide a written notice of denial within 90 days setting out: the reasons for the denial; provisions of the Program upon which the denial is based; any additional information to perfect the claim and why such information is necessary; the steps to be taken if a review is sought, including, as applicable, the right to file an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination; and the time limits for requesting a review and for review.
 
If a claim is denied and the Participant desires a review, he will notify the Secretary in writing within 60 days of the receipt of notice of denial. In requesting a review, the Participant may review the Program or any related document and submit any written statement he deems appropriate. The Secretary will then review the claim and, if the decision is adverse to the Participant, provide a written decision within 60 days setting out: the reasons for the denial; provisions of the Program upon which the denial is based; a statement that the Participant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, copies of documents relied upon in making the decision; and, as applicable, the Participant's right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.

DISTRIBUTION
 
5.1 . Distribution of a Participant's Account will be made within 90 days after termination of employment either in a lump sum or installments if elected. Prior to distribution, the Stock Units will be converted to the appropriate number of whole shares of Common Stock.
Distribution
 
Distribution of a Participant's Account will be based on the number of Stock Units credited to his Account upon termination of employment. If Stock Units are credited to the Participant's Account after a distribution has been made (, as a result of Dividend Contributions or Additional Matching Contributions), a subsequent distribution of those Stock Units will be made.
e.g.
 
5.2 . Distributions will be made in the form elected by the Participant. The forms of distribution are: (a) a lump sum amount, or (b) annual installments for up to 15 years. Annual installment distributions will be made by January 31
Form of Distribution
st
of each year following the year of the initial distribution. Each annual distribution will be equal to the balance of Stock Units in the Account divided by the number of payments remaining.
 
If the Company has not received a Participant's distribution election prior to his or her termination of employment, the distribution will be made in a lump sum. If a Participant's Account value does not exceed $50,000 on termination of employment, the distribution will be made in a lump sum regardless of the Participant's election otherwise.
 
5.3 . When Stock Units are converted to Common Stock for distribution, the Company may withhold from such Common Stock any amount required to pay applicable taxes (at the Company's required withholding rate). Alternatively, the Participant may pay such taxes in cash if he elects to do so before the distribution date.
Withholding from Distributions
 
5.4 . Notwithstanding the above, upon the termination of employment of a Participant who has less than 5 Years of Vesting Service, any Stock Units acquired by Company Matching and Additional Matching Contributions will be forfeited (unless the Committee determines otherwise).

DISTRIBUTION

Prior to distribution, the Stock Units will be converted to the appropriate number of whole shares of Common Stock.
Distribution
 
Distribution of a Participant's Account will be based on the number of Stock Units credited to his Account upon termination of employment.

e.g.
 
5.2 . Distributions will be made in the form elected by the Participant. The forms of distribution are: (a) a lump sum amount, or (b) annual installments for up to 15 years. Annual installment distributions will be made by January 31st of each Calendar Year following the Calendar Year of the initial distribution. Each annual distribution will be equal to the balance of Stock Units in the Account divided by the number of payments remaining.
Form of Distribution
 
If a Participant does not elect a form of distribution in his initial Election or if a Participant's Account value does not exceed $50,000 on termination of employment, the distribution will be made in a lump sum.
 
5.3 . When Stock Units are converted to Common Stock for distribution, the Company may withhold from such Common Stock any amount required to pay applicable taxes (at the Company's required withholding rate). Alternatively, the Participant may pay such taxes in cash if he elects to do so before the distribution date.
Withholding from Distributions
 
5.4 . Notwithstanding the above, upon the termination of employment of a Participant who has less than 5 Years of Vesting Service, any Stock Units acquired by Company Matching and Additional Matching Contributions will be forfeited (unless the Committee determines otherwise). However, such Stock Units will not be forfeited if the Participant's employment is terminated due to death or Disability.
Forfeiture of Stock Units
 
5.5 . If a Participant dies before he has received all distributions due under the Program, the remaining distributions will be made to his Beneficiary. Each Participant may designate a Beneficiary and change his Beneficiary from time to time. No such designation will become effective until received in writing by the Company. If a Participant has no living designated Beneficiary, then his Beneficiary will be his personal representative.
Beneficiary
 
5.6 In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency or Change in Control, the Committee may authorize an immediate distribution to the Participant as permitted under Section 409A.
Distribution Upon Unforeseeable Emergency or Change in Control.
