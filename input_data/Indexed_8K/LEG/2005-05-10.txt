Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 6, 2005, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (the "Company") commenced a medium-term note program (the "Program") pursuant to which up to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior debt securities of the Company may be issued from time to time.
 
On May 6, 2005, in connection with the commencement of the Program, the Company entered into an Indenture dated May 6, 2005 with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Trustee (the "Trustee") (the "Senior Indenture"), which is attached hereto as exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Senior Indenture, the Company may issue from time to time its debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, to be issued in one or more series, whether or not pursuant to the Program. The Senior Indenture is subject to and governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The Senior Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of debt securities that the Company may issue nor does it limit other debt that the Company may issue. The debt securities issued under the Senior Indenture will be unsecured obligations which would rank equally with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The terms and conditions, including payment terms, of the debt securities to be issued under the Senior Indenture will be determined from time to time by the Company. The Senior Indenture contains covenants which may apply to debt securities issued under the Senior Indenture that limit, among other things:
 
 
 
 
The Senior Indenture contains customary events of default and also includes as an event of default other defaults under other debt instruments of the Company in excess of $50 million under certain circumstances. Under the Senior Indenture, if an event of default occurs and is continuing in respect of any outstanding series of debt securities, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all of the debt securities of that series to be immediately due and payable. Events of default that result from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership generally result in the principal amount of all of the debt securities outstanding becoming due and payable immediately, without notice or other action by any holder or the Trustee. The debt securities issued under the Senior Indenture also may be subject to legal or covenant defeasance provisions and may be subject to conversion or exchange provisions. These covenants and other terms are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions.
Also on May 6, 2005, in connection with the commencement of the Program, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (collectively the "Agents"). Other agents may also from time to time become a party to the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company may offer medium-term notes pursuant to the Senior Indenture on a continuing basis through the Agents. Each of the Agents has agreed to use reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase, which may entitle one or more Agents to commissions at prescribed rates ranging from 0.125% to 0.825% of the principal amount of each medium-term note. The Company may also sell medium-term notes to any Agent, acting as principal, for a commission or at a discount to be agreed to at the time of sale. The Company reserves the right to offer, solicit offers and sell securities directly on its own behalf. The terms and conditions of the medium-term notes, including any applicable interest rate provisions, to be issued pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and the Senior Indenture will be determined from time to time by the Company, but generally may not exceed $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount. Under the Program, no medium-term note will have a term of less than 9 months or more than 50 years. The Company has specified the general form of fixed rate notes that may be issued pursuant to the Program which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference. The Company has also specified the general form of floating rate notes that may be issued pursuant to the Program which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and incorporated herein by reference. The Company must undertake certain administrative duties and pay principal and interest on securities issued under the Program. The Company also has certain ongoing obligations to provide certain materials and information to the Agents and generally to pay the Agents' costs and fees under the Distribution Agreement. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Agents against certain liabilities, including civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or contribute to payments which Agents may be required to make in this regard. The terms, obligations and conditions applicable to the Distribution Agreement and the medium-term notes are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions.

From time to time, the Company has entered into banking or other relationships with the Trustee. The Company previously entered into a senior indenture with the Trustee pursuant to which the Company has issued other debt securities. The Company has previously entered into underwriting arrangements with the Agents in connection with the past issuances of other of its debt securities. In the ordinary course of their
respective businesses, the Agents and their affiliates have engaged, and may, in the future engage, in commercial banking and/or investment banking transactions with the Company and its affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Trustee, is an affiliate of J.P.Morgan Securities Inc.

(viii) this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(ix) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any federal or Missouri court or governmental agency or body is required to be obtained by the Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or in any applicable Terms Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the solicitation by the Agents to purchase the Securities and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained;
 
(x) neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation by the Company of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment by the Company of the terms hereof or of any applicable Terms Agreement will result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under (A) the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (B) the terms of any indenture or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or bound, (C) any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel to be specifically applicable to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries of any federal or Missouri court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or (D) any provision of federal or Missouri statute or governmental regulation applicable to the Company;

Such opinion shall also state that, although such counsel does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes such counsel to believe that at the Effective Date the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements, related financial statement schedules and other financial and statistical information and written information relating to and furnished by the Agents contained therein or omitted therefrom, and except for the part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1 Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, as to which such counsel need express no opinion)

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Missouri or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Agents and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in
 
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates exceeds the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
8. Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect of any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company defaults on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
 
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements by any Agent and the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
10. This Agreement may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company as to any Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of oral (confirmed in writing) or written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be; , that in the event of such suspension or termination with respect to any Agent, (i) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not occurred, (ii) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the rights and obligations of any party that have previously accrued or that relate to Securities that are already issued, agreed to be issued or the subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and (iii) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), and Sections 4(d), 4(e), 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof are concerned.

No purchaser of any of the Securities through or from any Agent hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

Pursuant to Section 4(j) and Section 6(d), as the case may be, of the Agreement, the Company's independent certified public accountants shall furnish letters to the effect that:
 
They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder.
 
In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations thereunder.
 
On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or that any material modifications should be made for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
(B) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma
 
adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
 
(C) as of the date of the latest available financial statements of the Company and at a subsequent date not more than five business days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock under the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, Retirement Savings Plan, Stock Option and Incentive Plans or other similar plans, and the incurrence of capital stock issuance expenses) of the Company or in the preferred stock or other securities of the Company's subsidiaries, or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any decreases in consolidated net assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or other items specified by the Agents, or any increases in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared with the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases that the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or that are described in such letter; and
 
(D) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus ending as of the date of the latest available financial statements of the Company and at (i) the most recent month end if the date of such letter is 15 or more days following such most recent month end or (ii) the month end immediately preceding the most recent month end if the date of such letter is fewer than 15 days following such most recent month end, there were any decreases in consolidated revenues of the Company, or any increases in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Agents, except in each case for increases or decreases that the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or that are described in such letter;
 
In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Agents that are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, that appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Agents or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Agents, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
 
All references to the Prospectus in this Annex III shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Agreement as of the Commencement Date referred to in Section 6(d) thereof and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as of the date of the amendment, supplement, incorporation or the Time of Delivery relating to an agreement to purchase Securities as principal requiring the delivery of such letter under Section 4(j) thereof.

decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding Debt Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee and in such manner as shall be specified in such Global Note. Any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Global Note, after its initial issuance, shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 1.2 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
 
Global Notes may be issued in either registered or bearer form and in either temporary or permanent form.

(5) the rate or rates (which may be variable or fixed) at which the Debt Securities of the series shall bear interest, if any, or the method by which such rate or rates shall be determined, the date or dates from which such interest, if any, shall accrue or the method by which such date or dates shall be determined (which, in either case or both, if so provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution or supplemental indenture, may be determined by the Company from time to time and set forth in the Debt Securities of the series issued from time to time); and the Interest Payment Dates on which such interest shall be payable (or the method of determination thereof), if any, the Regular Record Date for any interest payable on any Registered Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date, the Person to whom any interest on any Registered Debt Security of the series shall be payable, if other than the Person in whose name that Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, and the manner in which, or the Person to whom, any interest on any Bearer Security of the series shall be payable, if otherwise than upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto as they severally mature;

All Debt Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination, rate of interest, Stated Maturity and the date from which interest, if any, shall accrue, which, as set forth above, may be determined by the Company from time to time as to Debt Securities of a series if so provided in or established pursuant to the authority granted in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in any such indenture supplemental hereto, and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution and (subject to Section 3.3) set forth in such Officers' Certificate, or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.

SECTION 3.2. Denominations.
 
In the absence of any specification pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, the Debt Securities of such series shall be issuable only as Registered Securities in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and shall be payable only in Dollars.
 
SECTION 3.3. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
 
The Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of any series shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, its Chief Operating Officer, its President, one of its Vice Presidents or its Treasurer. The signature of any of these officers may be manual or facsimile.
 
Debt Securities and Coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons or did not hold such offices at the date of such Debt Securities and Coupons.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debt Securities, with appropriate Coupons, if any, of any series, executed by the Company, to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities and Coupons; provided, however, that, in connection with its sale during the "restricted period" (as defined in Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(7) of the United States Treasury Regulations), no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and provided, further, that a Bearer Security (other than a temporary Global Note in bearer form) may be delivered outside the United States in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished to Euroclear or to Clearstream a certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture. If all the Debt Securities of any one series are not to be issued at one time and if a Board Resolution or the Officers' Certificate or other document pursuant to a Board Resolution or supplemental indenture relating to such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Debt Securities and for the determination of the terms thereof, such as interest rate, Stated Maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue. If any Debt Security shall be represented by a Permanent Global Note, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 3.4, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Debt Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Note shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such Permanent Global Note. Except as permitted by Section 3.6 or 3.7, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons for interest then matured have been detached and canceled.
 
The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, prior to the authentication and delivery of the Debt Securities and
 
Coupons of such series, (i) the supplemental indenture or the Board Resolution by or pursuant to which the form and terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been approved and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel substantially to the effect that:
 
(1) the Company Order furnished by the Company to the Trustee in connection with the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons conforms to the requirements of this Indenture and constitutes sufficient authority hereunder for the Trustee to authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities and Coupons;
 
(2) the forms and terms (or, if applicable, the manner of determining the terms) of such Debt Securities and Coupons are consistent with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(3) in the event that the forms or terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been established in a supplemental indenture, the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, such supplemental indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and subject to such other exceptions as counsel shall conclude do not materially affect the rights of the Holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons; and
 
(4) the execution and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and such Debt Securities and Coupons (if to be issued at the time of delivery of such Company Order) have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authentication by the Trustee and execution and delivery by the Company (if to be issued after delivery of such Company Order in accordance with the foregoing procedures), are valid and binding obligations enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, entitled to the benefit of the Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and subject to such other exceptions as counsel shall conclude do not materially affect the rights of the Holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons; and
 
(5) the amount of Debt Securities Outstanding of such series, together with the amount of such Debt Securities, does not exceed any limit established under the terms of this Indenture on the amount of Debt Securities of such series that may be authenticated and delivered.
 
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Debt Securities and Coupons if the issuance of such Debt Securities and Coupons pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Debt Securities and this Indenture in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security (including any temporary or permanent or other definitive Bearer Security in global form) shall be dated as of the date of original issuance of the first Debt Security of such series to be issued, except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to the Bearer Securities of any series.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraphs, if all Debt Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution or any Officers' Certificate or other document pursuant to a Board Resolution otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order, the Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraphs or Sections 1.2 and 2.1 at or prior to the authentication of each Debt Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Debt Security of such series to be issued.
 
With respect to Debt Securities of a series that are not to be originally issued at one time, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Debt Securities, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 3.1 and this Section, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Debt Securities of such series.
 
No Debt Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Debt Security a certificate of authentication substantially in one of the forms provided for herein duly executed by an authorized officer of the Trustee or by an Authenticating Agent, and such certificate upon any Debt Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Debt Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Debt Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Debt Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.8 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.2) stating that such Debt Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Debt Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
SECTION 3.4. Temporary Debt Securities; Exchange of Temporary Global Notes for Definitive Bearer Securities; Global Notes Representing Registered Securities.
 
(a) Pending the preparation of definitive Registered Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Registered Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise
 
produced, in any authorized denomination for Registered Securities of such series, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Registered Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Registered Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Registered Securities. Every such temporary Registered Security shall be executed by the Company and shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Registered Securities in lieu of which they are issued. In the case of any series issuable as Bearer Securities, such temporary Debt Securities may be in global form, representing such of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
 
Except in the case of temporary Debt Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of such series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series, of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions, upon surrender of the temporary Debt Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder, except as provided in Section 3.5 in connection with a transfer. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debt Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of a like Stated Maturity and like terms and provisions; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer Security (including a permanent Bearer Security in global form) shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.3 and this Section 3.4. Until so exchanged, the temporary Registered Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Registered Securities of such series.
 
(b) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, all Bearer Securities of a series shall be initially issued in the form of a single temporary Bearer Security in global form (a "temporary Global Note"). The Company shall execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate, any temporary Global Note and any permanent Bearer Security in global form (as described below, a "Permanent Global Note") upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as definitive Bearer Securities, and the temporary or Permanent Global Note, as the case may be, shall, unless otherwise specified therein, be delivered by the Trustee to the London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common Depositary"), for the benefit of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, for credit to the account of the Company (in the case of sales of Bearer Securities by the Company directly to investors) or the managing underwriter (in the case of sales of Bearer Securities by the Company to underwriters) or such other accounts as the Company or the managing underwriter, respectively, may direct.
 
On or after the date specified in or determined pursuant to the terms of any temporary Global Note which (subject to any applicable laws and regulations) shall be at least 40 days after
 
the issue date of a temporary Global Note (the "Exchange Date"), the Debt Securities represented by such temporary Global Note may be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (subject to the second succeeding paragraph) or Debt Securities to be represented thereafter by one or more Permanent Global Notes in definitive form without Coupons. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary Global Note shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, at such address as the Trustee may specify and following such surrender, the Trustee shall (1) endorse the temporary Global Note to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by an equal aggregate principal amount of such Debt Security, (2) endorse the applicable Permanent Global Note, if any, to reflect the initial amount, or an increase in the amount of Debt Securities represented thereby, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Debt Securities (including any Permanent Global Note), (4) deliver such definitive Debt Securities to the Holder thereof or, if such definitive Debt Security is a Permanent Global Note, deliver such Permanent Global Note to the Common Depositary to be held outside the United States for the accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, for credit to the respective accounts at Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, designated by or on behalf of the beneficial owners of such Debt Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct) and (5) redeliver such temporary Global Note to the Common Depositary, unless such temporary Global Note shall have been canceled in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Note, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such temporary Global Note shall be accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear, as to the portion of such temporary Global Note held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (including any Permanent Global Note), and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream, as to the portion of such temporary Global Note held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (including any Permanent Global Note), each substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Indenture. Each certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, shall be based on certificates of the account holders listed in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, as being entitled to all or any portion of the applicable temporary Global Note. An account holder of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, desiring to effect the exchange of an interest in a temporary Global Note for an interest in definitive Debt Securities (including any Permanent Global Note) shall instruct Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on its behalf and shall deliver to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and dated no earlier than 10 days prior to the Exchange Date. Until so exchanged, temporary Global Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities (including any Permanent Global Note) of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder, except as to payment of interest, if any.
 
The delivery to the Trustee by Euroclear or Clearstream of any certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto may be relied upon by the Company and the Trustee as conclusive evidence that a corresponding certificate or certificates has or have been delivered to the Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
 
On or prior to the Exchange Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Debt Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such
 
temporary Global Note, executed by the Company. At any time, on or after the Exchange Date, upon 30 days' notice to the Trustee by Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, acting at the request of or on behalf of the beneficial owner, a Debt Security represented by a temporary Global Note or a Permanent Global Note, as the case may be, may be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Debt Securities without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Note or such Permanent Global Note, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, as the portion of such temporary Global Note or such Permanent Global Note to be exchanged, which, unless the Debt Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, as contemplated by Section 3.1, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of the temporary Global Note only in compliance with the requirements of the second preceding paragraph. On or prior to the forty-fifth day following receipt by the Trustee of such notice with respect to a Debt Security, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, the temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note, as the case may be, shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Debt Securities without charge following such surrender, upon the request of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, and the Trustee shall (1) endorse the applicable temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by the aggregate principal amount of such Debt Security, (2) cause the terms of such Debt Security and Coupons, if any, to be entered on a definitive Debt Security, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Debt Security, and (4) if a Bearer Security is to be delivered, deliver such definitive Debt Security to an address outside the United States to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, for or on behalf of the beneficial owner thereof, in exchange for a portion of such temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note.
 
Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note, except that a Person receiving definitive Debt Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive Debt Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream. Definitive Debt Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note shall be delivered only to an address outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of redemption or acceleration of all or any part of a temporary Global Note prior to the Exchange Date, a Permanent Global Note or definitive Bearer Securities, as the case may be, will not be issuable in respect of such temporary Global Note or such portion thereof, and payment thereon will instead be made as provided in such temporary Global Note.
 
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, any temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of the same series and tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, interest payable on such temporary Global Note on an Interest Payment Date for Debt Securities of such series occurring
 
prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euroclear or Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear or Clearstream to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Indenture, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Note on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture.
 
Any definitive Bearer Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for a portion of a temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note shall not bear a coupon for any interest which shall theretofore have been duly paid by the Trustee to Euroclear or Clearstream, or by the Company to the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.4.
 
With respect to Exhibits A and B to this Indenture, the Company may, in its discretion and if required or desirable under applicable law or as set forth in or established pursuant to any Board Resolution or supplemental indenture with respect to any series of Debt Securities, substitute one or more other forms of such exhibits for such exhibits, eliminate the requirement that any or all certificates be provided, or change the time that any certificate may be required, provided that such substitute form or forms or notice of elimination or change of such certification requirement have theretofore been delivered to the Trustee with a Company Request and such form or forms, elimination or change is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
(c) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.1 that the Registered Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 3.3 and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Notes in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Notes, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the U.S. Depositary for such Global Note or Notes or the nominee of such depositary, and (iii) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "This Debt Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the U.S. Depositary to a nominee of the U.S. Depositary or by a nominee of the U.S. Depositary to the U.S. Depositary or another nominee of the U.S. Depositary or by the U.S. Depositary or any such nominee to a successor U.S. Depositary or a nominee of such successor U.S. Depositary, unless and until this Debt Security is exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in definitive form."
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 3.5, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Registered Securities in definitive form, a Global Note representing all or a portion of the Registered Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the U.S. Depositary for such series to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by such depositary or any such nominee to a successor U.S. Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor depositary.
 
If at any time the U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of such series or if at any time the U.S. Depositary for Debt Securities of a series shall no longer be a clearing agency registered and in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor U.S. Depositary with respect to the Debt Securities of such series. If a successor U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion, subject to the procedures of the U.S. Depositary, determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Notes shall no longer be represented by such Global Note or Notes. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
 
If the Registered Securities of any series shall have been issued in the form of one or more Global Notes and if an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company will promptly execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
 
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to Registered Securities of a series, the U.S. Depositary for such series of Registered Securities may surrender a Global Note for such series of Debt Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge:
 
(i) to each Person specified by the U.S. Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Note; and
 
(ii) to the U.S. Depositary a new Global Note in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Note and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
 
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for Registered Securities in definitive form, such Global Note shall be canceled by the Trustee. Debt Securities issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the U.S. Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Debt Securities to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities are so registered.
 
No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Note held on its behalf by a U.S. Depositary (or its nominee) shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Note or any Debt Security represented thereby, and such U.S. Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Note or any Debt Security represented thereby for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Note, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by a U.S. Depositary or impair, as between a U.S. Depositary and such holders of beneficial interest, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the U.S. Depositary (or its nominees) as Holder of any Debt Security.
 
SECTION 3.5. Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
 
(a) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers and exchanges of Registered Securities. Such Security Register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being accurately and completely converted into such form within a reasonable time. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and registering transfers and exchanges of Registered Securities as herein provided; provided, however, that the Company may appoint co-Security Registrars unless the terms of any series of Debt Securities provide otherwise.
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series of like aggregate principal amount of such denominations as are authorized for Registered Securities of such series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4 and this Section 3.5, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of like aggregate principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office
 
or agency. Whenever any Registered Securities are surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
(b) If and to the extent specified pursuant to Section 3.1, the provisions of this Section 3.5(b) shall be applicable to Debt Securities of any series which are Bearer Securities. At the option of the Holder thereof, to the extent permitted by law, any Bearer Security of any series which by its terms is registrable as to principal and interest may be exchanged for a Registered Security of such series of like aggregate principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions upon surrender of such Bearer Security at the Corporate Trust Office or at any other office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 3.1 for the purpose of making any such exchanges. Any Coupon Security surrendered for exchange shall be surrendered with all unmatured Coupons and any matured Coupons in default attached thereto. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. The Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Security or Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income tax laws and regulations applicable to Debt Securities in effect at the time of such exchange.
 
(c) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, in no event may Registered Securities, including Registered Securities received in exchange for Bearer Securities, be exchanged for Bearer Securities.
 
(d) All Debt Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Debt Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities surrendered for such transfer or exchange.
 
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Debt Securities except as provided in Sections 3.4(b) or 3.6. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration, transfer or exchange of Debt Securities, other than those expressly provided in this Indenture to be made at the Company's own expense or without expense or without charge to the Holders.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to register, transfer or exchange Debt Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the transmission of a notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 13.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such transmission, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Debt Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Debt Security being redeemed in part.
 
SECTION 3.6. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Debt Securities.
 
If (i) any mutilated Debt Security or any mutilated Coupon with the Coupon Security to which it appertains (and all unmatured Coupons attached thereto) is surrendered to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or (ii) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security or any Coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be satisfactory by them to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Debt Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, then the Company shall execute and upon Company Request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or in exchange for the Coupon Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, a new Debt Security of the same series of like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions and like principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with such Coupons attached thereto that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result from such exchange or substitution.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a
 
new Debt Security, pay the amount due on such Debt Security or Coupon in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 or except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.6, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Debt Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in respect thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Debt Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities or Coupons of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities or Coupons.
 
SECTION 3.7. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
 
(a) Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, interest on any Registered Security which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest notwithstanding the cancellation of such Registered Security upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the Regular Record Date. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, payment of interest on Registered Securities shall be made at the place or places specified pursuant to Section 3.1 or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or, if provided pursuant to Section 3.1 or in the case of Holders of $1 million or more in aggregate principal amount of a series of Debt Securities, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Registered Holder by the Regular Record Date.
 
(b) Interest on any Coupon Security which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Holder of the Coupon which has matured on such Interest Payment Date upon surrender of such Coupon on such Interest Payment Date at such Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (subject to the second to last paragraph of Section 12.3).
 
Interest on any Bearer Security (other than a Coupon Security) which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Holder of the Bearer Security upon presentation of such Bearer Security and notation thereon on such
 
Interest Payment Date at the Place of Payment maintained by the Company outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (subject to the second to last paragraph of Section 12.3).
 
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, at the option of the Company, payment on such Bearer Security or Coupon may be made by a check drawn on a bank outside the United States or by wire transfer to an appropriate account maintained by such Holder outside the United States.
 
(c) Any interest on any Debt Security which is payable but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall, if such Debt Security is a Registered Security, forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Registered Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money in the Currency or Currency unit in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.10) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which date shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holders of such Registered Securities at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Registered Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
 
requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
(d) Any Defaulted Interest payable in respect of Bearer Securities of any series shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustee in such manner that there is no discrimination between the Holders of Registered Securities (if any) and Bearer Securities of such series, and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, in the manner provided in Section 1.5 not more than 25 days and not less than 20 days prior to the date of the proposed payment.
 
(e) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debt Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.
 
SECTION 3.8. Cancellation.
 
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of any series, all Debt Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer, exchange or credit against any sinking fund and all Coupons surrendered for payment or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Registered Securities and matured Coupons so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. All Bearer Securities and unmatured Coupons so delivered shall be held by the Trustee and, upon instruction by the Company Order, shall be canceled or held for reissuance. Bearer Securities and unmatured Coupons held for reissuance may be reissued only in exchange for Bearer Securities of the same series and of like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions pursuant to Section 3.5 or in replacement of mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Bearer Securities of the same series and of like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions or the related Coupons pursuant to Section 3.6. All Bearer Securities and unmatured Coupons held by the Trustee pending such cancellation or reissuance shall be deemed to be delivered for cancellation for all purposes of this Indenture and the Securities. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Debt Securities or Coupons previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Debt Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued, and all Debt Securities or Coupons so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Debt Securities or Coupons shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Debt Securities or Coupons canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Debt Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be delivered to the Company upon Company Request or otherwise destroyed or disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures. The acquisition of any Debt Securities or Coupons by the Company shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented thereby unless and until such Debt Securities or Coupons are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. In the case of any temporary Global Note which shall be destroyed or disposed of if the entire aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities represented thereby has been exchanged, the certificate
 
of destruction or disposition shall state that all certificates required pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof and substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, to be given by Euroclear or Clearstream, have been duly presented to the Trustee by Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be. Permanent Global Notes shall not be destroyed or disposed of until exchanged in full for definitive Debt Securities or until payment thereon is made in full.
 
SECTION 3.9. Computation of Interest.
 
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of any series, interest on the Debt Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
SECTION 3.10. Currency of Payments in Respect of Debt Securities.
 
(a) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Bearer Securities of any series, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on Bearer Securities of such series denominated in any Currency will be made in such Currency.
 
(b) With respect to Registered Securities of any series not permitting the election provided for in paragraph (c) below or the Holders of which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (c) below, except as provided in paragraph (e) below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on any Registered Security of such series will be made in the Currency in which such Registered Security is payable.
 
(c) It may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to the Registered Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) below (and provided that in no instance may such election be made after a defeasance pursuant to Article XV or during the continuance of an Event of Default), to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on such Registered Securities in any of the Currencies which may be designated for such election in the applicable supplemental indenture or by or pursuant to a Board Resolution by delivering to the Trustee a written election, to be in form satisfactory to the Trustee, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such Currency, such election will remain in effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee (but any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such change or election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Registered Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has occurred or notice of redemption has been given by the Company pursuant to Article XIII). Any Holder of any such Registered Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee by the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment date in the relevant Currency as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.10.
 
(d) If the election referred to in paragraph (c) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.1, then not later than the fourth Business Day after the Election Date for each payment
 
date, the Trustee will deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the Currency in which each series of the Registered Securities is payable, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on the Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, specifying the amounts so payable in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the Holders of Registered Securities denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (c) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.1 and if at least one Holder has made such election, then, on the second Business Day preceding each payment date, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate in respect of the Currency payments to be made on such payment date. The Currency amount receivable by Holders of Registered Securities who have elected payment in a Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above shall be determined by the Company on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the third Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment date.
 
(e) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency or a Currency unit in which any of the Debt Securities are denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant to paragraph (c) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on the applicable Debt Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency or such Currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency or such Currency unit was used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the Currency of payment for use on each such payment date. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee and by the Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Debt Securities with respect to such payment date shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a Currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Currency Determination Agent, if any, or, if there shall not be a Currency Determination Agent, then by the Trustee, in the manner provided in paragraph (g) or (h) below.
 
(f) If the Holder of a Registered Security denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above, and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected Currency, such Holder shall receive payment in the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election. If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 3.10.
 
(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent, and shall be obtained for each subsequent payment date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
 
(h) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (i) below, shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.
 
(i) For purposes of this Section 3.10 the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
A "Component Currency" shall mean any Currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component Currency of the relevant Currency unit.
 
A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were represented in the relevant Currency unit on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single Currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single Currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single Currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single Currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more Currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more Currencies with appropriate Dollar equivalents at the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement equal to the Dollar equivalent of the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency at the Market Exchange Rate on such date, and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such Currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If after the Conversion Date of the relevant Currency unit a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such Currency unit, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
 
"Election Date" shall mean the earlier of (i) the seventh Business Day immediately preceding any payment date or (ii) the record date with respect to any payment date, and with respect to the Maturity shall mean the record date (if within 16 or fewer days prior to the Maturity) immediately preceding the Maturity, and with respect to any series of Debt Securities whose record date immediately preceding the Maturity is more than 16 days prior to the Maturity or any series of Debt Securities for which no record dates are provided with respect to interest payments, shall mean the date which is 16 days prior to the Maturity.
 
(j) All decisions and determinations of the Trustee or the Currency Determination Agent, if any, regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit and the Market Exchange Rate shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company and all Holders of the Debt Securities denominated or payable in the relevant
 
Currency. In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee (and the relevant Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 1.5 to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to a Currency unit in which Debt Securities are denominated or payable, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give written notice in the manner provided in Section 1.5 to the relevant Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event of any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above, the Company, after learning thereof, will similarly give written notice to the Trustee. The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Currency Determination Agent, if any, and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
 
(k) For purposes of any provision of the Indenture where the Holders of Outstanding Debt Securities may perform an Act which requires that a specified percentage of the Outstanding Debt Securities of all series perform such Act and for purposes of any decision or determination by the Trustee of amounts due and unpaid for the principal (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities of all series in respect of which moneys are to be disbursed ratably, the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Outstanding Debt Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency will be the amount in Dollars based upon the Market Exchange Rate for Debt Securities of such series, as of the date for determining whether the Holders entitled to perform such Act have performed it, or as of the date of such decision or determination by the Trustee, as the case may be.
 
(l) The Company hereby appoints itself as the initial Currency Determination Agent and the Company shall be entitled to remove such agent at any time; provided, however, that such removal shall not be effective and the agent may not resign until a successor has been appointed by the Company and the successor has accepted such appointment. The Trustee is under no duty or obligation to serve in the capacity of Currency Determination Agent.
 
SECTION 3.11. Judgments.
 
If for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Debt Security, it shall become necessary to convert into any other Currency any amount in the Currency due hereunder or under such Debt Security, then such conversion shall be made at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date the Company shall make payment to any Person in satisfaction of such judgment. If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date other than the date payment is made and there shall occur a change between such Market Exchange Rate and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of payment, the Company agrees to pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount in such other Currency which, when converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of payment or distribution, is the amount then due hereunder or under such Debt Security. Any amount due from the Company under this Section 3.11 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or in
 
respect of any Debt Security. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the Currency or Currency unit due hereunder or under such Debt Security at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect when payment is made than the amount of Currency stated to be due hereunder or under such Debt Security so that in any event the Company's obligations hereunder or under such Debt Security will be effectively maintained as obligations in such Currency, and the Company shall be entitled to withhold (or be reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion over the amount due and payable on the date of payment or distribution.
 
SECTION 3.12. Exchange Upon Default.
 
If default is made in the payments referred to in Section 12.1, the Company hereby undertakes that upon presentation and surrender of a Permanent Global Note to the Trustee (or to any other Person or at any other address as the Company may designate in writing), on any Business Day on or after the maturity date of such defaulted payments the Company will issue and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver to the bearer of such Permanent Global Note duly executed and authenticated definitive Debt Securities with the same issue date and maturity date as set out in such Permanent Global Note.
 
SECTION 3.13. CUSIP Numbers.
 
The Company in issuing Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

SECTION 4.1. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
 
This Indenture, with respect to the Debt Securities of any series (if all series issued under this Indenture are not to be affected), shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of such Debt Securities herein expressly provided for and rights to receive payments of principal (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Securities) and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:
 
(1) either
 
(A) all Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Debt Securities and Coupons of such series which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have
 
been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6, (ii) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities surrendered for exchange for Registered Securities and maturing after such exchange, whose surrender is not required or has been waived under Section 3.5, (iii) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date, whose surrender has been waived as provided in Section 13.6, and (iv) Debt Securities and Coupons of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 12.4) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(B) all Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
 
(i) have become due and payable by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise, or
 
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
 
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
 
and the Company, either complies with any other condition or terms specified pursuant to Section 3.1, or if not so specified in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subclause (B), has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds held in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in United States Dollars in an amount, U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in Section 15.2) which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.10) sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Debt Securities not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any and accrued interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Debt Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
 
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
 
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein
 
provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series have been complied with.
 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, and if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 12.4, shall survive. If, after the deposit referred to in Section 4.1 has been made, (x) the Holder of a Debt Security is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 3.10(c), to receive payment in a Currency other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.1 was made, or (y) if a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the Currency in which the deposit was made or elected to be received by the Holder pursuant to Section 3.10(c), then the indebtedness represented by such Debt Security shall be fully discharged to the extent that the deposit made with respect to such Debt Security shall be converted into the Currency in which such payment is made.
 
SECTION 4.2. Application of Trust Money, Etc.
 
The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall promptly pay or return to the Company upon Company Request any moneys or U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time that are not required for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities of any series for which money or U.S. Government Obligations have been deposited pursuant to Section 4.1.
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 12.4, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
 
The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee for any series of Debt Securities against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 4.1 or the interest and principal received in respect of such U.S. Government Obligations other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is payable by or on behalf of Holders. The obligation of the Company under this Section 4.2 shall be deemed to be an obligation of the Company under Section 6.7.
 
 
 
SECTION 5.1. Events of Default.
 
"Event of Default" wherever used herein with respect to Debt Securities of any series, and unless otherwise provided with respect to Debt Securities of any series pursuant to Section 3.1, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law, pursuant to any
 
judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
 
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Debt Security or any payment with respect to the Coupons, if any, of such series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
 
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debt Security of such series at its Maturity; or
 
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Debt Security of such series, and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
 
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which expressly has been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of Debt Securities of a series other than such series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
 
(5) the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
 
(6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or the consent by it to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they
 
become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or
 
(7) default as defined in any other indenture, loan or credit agreement or other instrument evidencing or under which the Company has outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money in a principal amount exceeding $50,000,000, shall be continuing and such indebtedness shall have been accelerated so that it has been declared due and payable in full prior to its stated maturity, and such acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled or such indebtedness shall not be discharged within 10 days after written notice of such acceleration has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series; provided, however, that if such Event of Default is remedied or cured by the Company or waived by the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed to have been remedied, cured or waived without further action by the Holders; or
 
(8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Debt Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.1.
 
SECTION 5.2. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
If an Event of Default (unless otherwise provided with respect to Debt Securities of any series pursuant to Section 3.1, other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (5) or (6) of Section 5.1) with respect to Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case, unless the principal of all Debt Securities shall have already become due and payable, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series may declare the principal amount (or, if any Debt Securities of such series are Discount Securities or indexed securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Discount Securities as may be specified in the terms of such Discount Securities or indexed securities) of all the Debt Securities of such series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest (and premium, if payable) shall become immediately due and payable. Unless otherwise provided with respect to Debt Securities of any series pursuant to Section 3.1, if an Event of Default specified in clauses (5) or (6) of Section 5.1 occurs, such amount shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Upon payment of such amount in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.10), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal of the Debt Securities of such series shall terminate.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Debt Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article V provided, the Holders of a majority in
 
principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
 
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.10) sufficient to pay
 
 
 
 
 
and
 
(2) All Events of Default with respect to Debt Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Debt Securities of such series which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
 
No such rescission and waiver shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 5.3. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
The Company covenants that if
 
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Debt Security or any payment with respect to any Coupons when such interest or payment becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days,
 
(2) default is made in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debt Security at the Maturity thereof, or
 
(3) default is made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation when the same becomes due pursuant to the terms of the Debt Securities of any series, and such default continues for a period of 30 days,
 
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Debt Securities or of such Coupons, the amount then due and payable on such Debt Securities or matured Coupons, for the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and upon overdue installments of interest, at the Overdue Rate; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and Coupons, and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and Coupons wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities and Coupons of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
SECTION 5.4. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceedings, or any voluntary or involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of a particular series or all or substantially all of the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of such Debt Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
 
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Debt Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be due and payable with respect to such series pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 5.2) (and premium, if any) and interest
 
owing and unpaid in respect of the Debt Securities and Coupons of such series and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each such Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt Securities and any Coupons of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 5.5. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Debt Securities.
 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of any series may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Debt Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name, as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Debt Securities or Coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
SECTION 5.6. Application of Money Collected.
 
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Debt Securities or Coupons of any series in respect of which money has been collected and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
 
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
 
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities or Coupons of such series, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has
 
been collected ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Debt Securities or Coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and
 
THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled thereto.
 
SECTION 5.7. Limitation on Suits.
 
No Holder of any Debt Security or Coupon of any series shall have any right to institute any action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian, sequestrator (or similar official) or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
 
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such series,
 
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder,
 
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request,
 
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding, and
 
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holders or of the Holders of Outstanding Debt Securities or Coupons of any other series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 5.7, each and every Holder of Debt Securities or Coupons of any series and the Trustee for such series shall be entitled to such relief as can be given at law or in equity.
 
SECTION 5.8. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Debt Security or of any Coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Debt Security
 
or Coupon on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Debt Security or Coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and interest thereon, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
 
SECTION 5.9. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
SECTION 5.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Indenture, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
SECTION 5.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 5.12. Control By Holders.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred by this Indenture on the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, provided, that:
 
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;
 
(2) subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of Debt
 
Securities of such series not joining in any such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; and
 
(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
SECTION 5.13. Waiver of Past Defaults.
 
The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Debt Securities of any such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default:
 
(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Security of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment or analogous obligation with respect to the Debt Securities of such series; or
 
(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which pursuant to Article XI cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Debt Security of such series affected; provided that a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series may rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration with respect to Debt Securities of a given series, as provided in section 5.2.
 
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of the Debt Securities of such series under this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 5.14. Undertaking for Costs.
 
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Debt Security or any Coupon by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit other than the Trustee of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant, but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of a Debt Security or Coupon for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on such Debt Security or the payment of any Coupon on or after the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Debt Security or Coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
 
 
 
SECTION 6.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
 
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of any series:
 
(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
 
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
 
(b) In case an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall, with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
 
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
(1) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section;
 
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it with respect to Debt Securities of any series in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;
 
(4) the Trustee is under no obligation or duty to pay interest on or invest any funds deposited with it except as specifically provided in this Indenture, and all investment activities undertaken by the Trustee, if any, shall be at and pursuant to the written instruction of the Company; and
 
(5) the Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
 
(e) Any opinion required or permitted to be delivered to the Trustee hereunder may be addressed and delivered to the entity serving as Trustee hereunder solely in its individual capacity and not in its capacity as Trustee or as representative of the holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons issued by the Company.
 
SECTION 6.2. Notice of Defaults.
 
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to Debt Securities or Coupons, if any, of any series, the Trustee shall give notice to all Holders of Debt Securities and Coupons of such series of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Security or Coupon of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Debt Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Debt Securities and of Coupons of such series; and provided, further, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.1(4) with respect to Debt Securities of such series no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 90 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of such series.
 
Notice given pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be transmitted by mail:
 
(1) to all Registered Holders, as the names and addresses of the Registered Holders appear in the Security Register;
 
(2) to such Holders of Bearer Securities of any series as have within two years preceding such transmission, filed their names and addresses with the Trustee for such series for that purpose; and
 
(3) to each Holder of a Debt Security of any series whose name and address appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.2(a) of this Indenture.

(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;
 
(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of Debt Securities of any series pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
 
(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, Officers' Certificate or other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by not less than a majority of the Holders of the Outstanding Debt Securities affected thereby, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;

SECTION 6.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Debt Securities.
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Debt Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Debt Securities or Coupons, if any, of any series. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any Debt Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
SECTION 6.5. May Hold Debt Securities.
 
The Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Debt Securities or Coupons, and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.
 
SECTION 6.6. Money Held in Trust.
 
Money in any Currency held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

SECTION 6.7. Compensation and Reimbursement.
 
The Company agrees:
 
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation in Dollars for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the trustee in Dollars upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except to the extent any such expense, disbursement or advance may be attributable to its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; and
 
(3) to indemnify in Dollars the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust or performance of its duties hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent that any such claim or liability may be attributable to the Trustee's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
 
As consideration for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim senior to the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the payment of amounts due on particular Debt Securities and Coupons.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6.7 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to reimburse it for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness under this Indenture and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
 
SECTION 6.8. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
 
If the Trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest within the meaning of the TIA with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, then, within 90 days after ascertaining that it has such conflicting interest, and if the default to which such conflicting interest relates has not been cured or duly waived or otherwise eliminated before the end of such 90-day period, the Trustee shall either eliminate such conflicting interest or resign with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the TIA and this Indenture, and the Company shall take prompt steps to have a successor appointed, in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of Section 310(b) of the TIA. In determining whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest within the meaning of the TIA with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, there shall be excluded Debt Securities of any particular series of Debt Securities issued under this Indenture other than that series, and the Indenture dated as of November 24, 1999, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee.

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State or District of Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
 
report of condition so published. Neither the Company nor any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company shall serve as Trustee upon any Debt Securities.
 
SECTION 6.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
 
(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 6.11.
 
(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series.
 
(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Debt Securities of any series and a successor Trustee appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
(d) If at any time:
 
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.8 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debt Security of such series for at least six months, or
 
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.9 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
 
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
 
then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Debt Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 5.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debt Security of any series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee for the Debt Securities of such series.
 
(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series (except as provided in Section 6.10(c)) (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with
 
respect to the Debt Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of such series and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debt Security of such series for at least six months may, subject to Section 5.14, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series.
 
(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.5 to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
SECTION 6.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
 
(a) In the case of an appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Debt Securities, each such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee, but, on request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section 6.7.
 
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Debt Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
 
respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in any such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any other trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of any such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
 
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
SECTION 6.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
 
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Debt Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Debt Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Debt Securities. In case any Debt Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.
 
SECTION 6.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
 
The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed is subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated therein.
 
SECTION 6.14. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
 
As long as any Debt Securities of a series remain Outstanding, upon a Company Request, there shall be an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") appointed, for such period as the Company shall elect, by the Trustee for such series of Debt Securities to act as its agent on its behalf and subject to its direction in connection with the authentication and delivery of each series of Debt Securities for which it is serving as Trustee. Debt Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by such Trustee. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities of any series by the Trustee for such series or to the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee for such series by an Authenticating Agent for such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf of such Trustee by such Authenticating Agent, except that only the Trustee may authenticate Debt Securities upon original issuance and pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof. Such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $10,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Debt Securities for which it served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee for such series or such Authenticating Agent.
 
The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company in the manner set forth in Section 1.4. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the applicable Trustee and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to one or more or all series of Debt Securities, the Trustee for such series shall upon Company Request appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, and the Company shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Debt Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.5. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as
 
Authenticating Agent herein. The Company agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent for each series from time to time reasonable compensation for its services. The Authenticating Agent for the Debt Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee for such series.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Debt Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
 
This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated therein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
 
SECTION 7.1. Company to Furnish Trustee Names and Addresses of Holders.
 
If the Trustee is not acting as Security Registrar for the Registered Securities of each series for which it acts as Trustee, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:
 
(a) semi-annually on a date not more than 15 days after each Regular Record Date with respect to an Interest Payment Date, if any, for the Registered Securities of such series (or on semi-annual dates in each year to be determined pursuant to Section 3.1 if the Registered Securities of such series do not bear interest), a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Registered Holders as of the date 15 days next preceding each such Regular Record Date (or such semi-annual dates, as the case may be); and
 
(b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished.
 
The Company shall also be required to furnish to the Trustee at all such times set forth above all information in the possession or control of the Company or any of its Paying Agents other than the Trustee as to the names and addresses of the Holders of Bearer Securities of all series; provided, however, that the Company shall have no obligation to investigate any matter relating to any Holders of Bearer Securities of any series.
 
SECTION 7.2. Preservation of Information; Communication to Holders.
 
(a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of Holders (i) contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 7.1, (ii) received by it in the capacity of Security Registrar (if so acting) hereunder and (iii) filed with it within the two preceding years pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the TIA.
 
The Trustee may (i) destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 7.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished, (ii) destroy any information received by it as Paying Agent (if so acting) hereunder upon delivering to itself as Trustee, not earlier than 45 days after an Interest Payment Date, a list containing the names and addresses of the Holders obtained from such information since the delivery of the next previous list, if any, (iii) destroy any list delivered to itself as Trustee which was compiled from information received by it as Paying Agent (if so acting) hereunder upon the receipt of a new list so delivered, and (iv) destroy not earlier than two years after filing, any information filed with it pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the TIA.
 
(b) The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under the Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee shall be as provided by Section 312(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(c) Every Holder of Debt Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with Section 7.2(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing of any material pursuant to a request made under Section 7.2(b).
 
SECTION 7.3. Reports by Trustee.
 
Within 60 days after May 15 of each year, commencing with the later of May 15, 2005, or the first May 15 after the first issuance of Debt Securities pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall, to the extent required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, transmit to all Holders of Debt Securities of any series with respect to which it acts as Trustee, in the manner provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, a brief report dated as of such May 15.
 
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed with the Company and the Company shall file such report with each stock exchange upon which any Debt Securities of such series are listed, with the Commission and also with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any series of Debt Securities are listed on any stock exchange and any delisting thereof.
 
SECTION 7.4. Reports by Company.
 
Unless otherwise specified with respect to a particular series of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 3.1, the Company will:
 
(1) file with the Trustee, after the Company is required to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to remain subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission, the Company shall continue to file with the Commission and provide the Trustee and the Holders of each series of Debt Securities with, without cost to each Holder, (a) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K (or any successor or comparable form) containing the information required to be contained therein (or required in such successor or comparable form); (b) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q (or any successor or comparable form); and (c) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K (or any successor or comparable form) containing the information required to be contained therein (or required in any successor or comparable form); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file such reports with the Commission if the Commission does not permit such filings.
 
(2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and
 
(3) transmit to all Holders of Debt Securities, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 7.3, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.
 
 
 
SECTION 8.1. Acts of Holders.
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent or proxy duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided,
 
such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series may take any Act, the fact that the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (a) by the instrument or instruments executed by Holders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the record of Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of such Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article IX, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders.
 
The Company may, at its option, by Company Order, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Debt Securities entitled to give any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act solicited by the Company, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so; that the Company may not fix a record date for the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next sentence. In addition, the Trustee may, at its option, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Debt Securities entitled to join in the giving or making of any Notice of Default, any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 5.2, any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 5.7 or any direction referred to in Section 5.12. If any such record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, or such notice, declaration, request or direction, may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of Registered Debt Securities of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Registered Debt Securities for the purposes of determining (i) whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding Debt Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act (and for that purpose the Outstanding Registered Debt Securities shall be computed as of the record date) and/or (ii) which Holders of Registered Debt Securities may revoke any such Act (notwithstanding Section 8.4); and any such Act, given as aforesaid, shall be effective whether or not the Holders of Registered Debt Securities which authorized or agreed or consented to such Act remain Holders of Registered Debt Securities after such record date and whether or not the Debt Securities held by such Holders remain Outstanding after such record date.
provided, however,
 
SECTION 8.2. Proof of Ownership; Proof of Execution of Instruments by Holder.
 
The ownership of Registered Securities of any series shall be proved by the Security Register for such series or by a certificate of the Security Registrar for such series.
 
The ownership of Bearer Securities shall be proved by production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed by any bank or trust company, which certificate shall be dated and shall state that on the date thereof a Bearer Security bearing a specified identifying number or other mark was deposited with or exhibited to the Person executing such certificate by the Person named in such certificate, or by any other proof of possession reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding by the Person named in any such certificate of any Bearer Security specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one year unless at the time of determination of such holding (1) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect of the
 
same Bearer Security shall be produced, (2) such Bearer Security shall be produced by some other Person, (3) such Bearer Security shall have been registered on the Security Register, if, pursuant to Section 3.1, such Bearer Security can be so registered, or (4) such Bearer Security shall have been canceled or paid.
 
Subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1, 6.3 and 9.5, proof of the execution of a writing appointing an agent or proxy and of the execution of any instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company if made in the following manner:
 
The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds, that the Person executing such instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, as the case may be, or by any other person acting in a representative capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
 
The record of any Holders' meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 9.6.
 
The Trustee may in any instance require further or other proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section so long as the request is a reasonable one.
 
SECTION 8.3. Persons Deemed Owners.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest, if any, on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Bearer Security or of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or Coupon for the purposes of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bearer Security or Coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All payments made to any Holder, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon such Debt Security or Coupon.
 
SECTION 8.4. Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound.

No payment of principal, premium or interest on Bearer Securities shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, that, if the Debt Securities of a series are denominated and payable in Dollars, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on any Bearer Security (including any additional amounts payable on Securities of such series, if so provided pursuant to Section 3.1) shall be made at the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City and State of New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such principal, premium, interest or additional amounts, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies outside the United States maintained for the purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
 
The Company may also from time to time designate different or additional offices or agencies to be maintained for such purposes (in or outside of such Place of Payment), and may from time to time rescind any such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations described in the preceding paragraphs. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such additional designation or rescission of designation and any change in the location of any such different or additional office or agency.
 
SECTION 12.4. Money for Debt Securities; Payments to be Held in Trust.
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Debt Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents with respect to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons, it will, by 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each due date of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Securities of such series, deposit with any such Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless any such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
Notwithstanding any term herein to the contrary, in no instance shall the Trustee be under any duty or obligation (i) to maintain any office or to act in any capacity as an agent for any purpose under this Indenture (or any supplement hereto) outside the United States, or (ii) to act as a Paying Agent in respect of any currency other than Dollars.
 
The Company will cause each Paying Agent with respect to any series of Debt Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
 
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Debt Securities of such series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
 
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Debt Securities of such series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Debt Securities of such series; and

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company upon Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Debt Security or Coupon shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be transmitted in the manner and to the extent provided by Section 1.5, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

(1) Liens existing on the date of this Indenture;
 
(2) Liens securing all or part of the acquisition, development, refurbishing, improvement, or construction price of the property, including Liens securing refinancings that do not exceed the acquisition, construction, development, refurbishing, or improvement price of the property;

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of any series, the Company will not itself, and it will not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Subsidiary of any Principal Property, whether such Principal Property is now owned or hereafter acquired (except for temporary leases for a term, including renewals at the option of the lessee, of not more than three years and except for leases between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries), which has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person with the intention of taking back a lease of such property (herein referred to as a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless either:
 
(1) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled to create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee indebtedness secured by a lien upon such Principal Property at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt in respect of such arrangement without equally and ratably securing the Debt Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5; provided, however, that from and after the date on which such arrangement becomes effective, the Attributable Debt in respect of such arrangement shall be deemed for all purposes to be secured indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary subject to the provisions of Section 12.5,
 
(2) within a period commencing twelve months prior to the consummation of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction and ending twelve months after the consummation of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has expended, or will expend, for the Principal Property an amount equal to (a) the net proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, and the Company elects to designate such amount as a credit against such Sale and Leaseback Transaction or (b) a part of the net proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction and the Company elects to designate such amount as a credit against such Sale and Leaseback Transaction and applies an amount equal to the remainder of the net proceeds as provided in clause (3) hereof, or
 
(3) such Sale and Leaseback Transaction does not come within the exceptions provided by clause (1) hereof and the Company does not make the election permitted by clause (2) hereof or makes such election only as to a part of such net proceeds, in either of which event the Company shall apply an amount in cash equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of such arrangement (less any amount elected under clause (2) hereof) to the retirement, within 90 days of the effective date of any such arrangement, of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Subsidiary (other than indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company which is subordinated to the Debt Securities) which by its terms matures at or is extendible or renewable at the sole option of the obligor without requiring the consent of the obligee to a date more than twelve months after the date of the creation of such indebtedness for borrowed money (it being understood that such retirement may be made by prepayment of such indebtedness for borrowed money, if permitted by the terms thereof, as well as by payment at maturity, and that, at the option of the Company, such indebtedness may include the Debt Securities).
 
SECTION 12.7. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
 
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 12.5 and Section 12.6 (and if so specified pursuant to Section 3.1, any other covenant not set forth herein and specified pursuant to Section 3.1 to be applicable to the Debt Securities of any series and to be subject to this Section 12.7), with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.1, with respect to the Debt Securities of such series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent expressly so waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
 
 
SECTION 13.1. Applicability of Article.
 
Debt Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
 
SECTION 13.2. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
 
The election of the Company to redeem any Debt Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company, the Company shall, at least 45 days before the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Debt Securities (a) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Debt Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, or (b) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Debt Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restrictions or condition.
 
SECTION 13.3. Selection by Trustee of Debt Securities to be Redeemed.
 
Except in the case of a redemption in whole of the Bearer Securities or the Registered Securities of such series, if less than all the Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed at the election of the Company, the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of
 
portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series in a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 3.2 in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated. The portions of the principal amount of Debt Securities so selected for partial redemption shall be equal to the minimum authorized denominations for Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 3.2 in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated or any integral multiple thereof, except as otherwise set forth in the applicable form of Debt Securities. In any case when more than one Registered Security of such series is registered in the same name, the Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Registered Security of such series.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debt Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
If any Debt Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before the Redemption Date, the converted portion of such Debt Security shall be deemed, to the fullest extent practicable, to be the portion selected for redemption. Debt Securities which have been converted during a selection of Debt Securities to be redeemed, may be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.
 
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities shall relate, in the case of any Debt Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
SECTION 13.4. Notice of Redemption.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by the Company, or at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to the Holders of Debt Securities of any series to be redeemed in whole or in part pursuant to this Article XIII, in the manner provided in Section 1.5. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. Failure to give such notice, or any defect in such notice to the Holder of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption, in whole or in part, shall not affect the sufficiency of any notice of redemption with respect to the Holder of any other Debt Security of such series.
 
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
(1) the Redemption Date;
 
(2) the Redemption Price, or if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof;
 
(3) that Debt Securities of such series are being redeemed by the Company pursuant to provisions contained in this Indenture or the terms of the
 
Debt Securities of such series or a supplemental indenture establishing such series, if such be the case, together with a brief statement of the facts permitting such redemption;
 
(4) if less than all Outstanding Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed;
 
(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Debt Security to be redeemed, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
 
(6) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Coupon Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption, failing which the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price;
 
(7) the Place or Places of Payment where such Debt Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
 
(8) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on the Redemption Date pursuant to Section 3.5(b) or otherwise, the last date on which such exchanges may be made;
 
(9) the CUSIP number, if any, and that no representation is made as to the accuracy or correctness of the CUSIP number, if any, listed on such notice or printed on the Debt Securities; and
 
(10) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
 
SECTION 13.5. Deposit of Redemption Price.
 
On or prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date for any Debt Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 12.4) an amount of money in the Currency or Currencies in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of such Debt Securities or any portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.
 
SECTION 13.6. Debt Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, any Debt Securities so to be redeemed shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.10), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
 
in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Debt Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Debt Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Debt Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, only upon presentation and surrender of Coupons for such interest; and provided, further, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, installments of interest on Registered Securities which have a Stated Maturity on or prior to the Redemption Date for such Debt Securities shall be payable according to the terms of such Debt Securities and the provisions of Section 3.7.
 
If any Debt Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Debt Security.
 
If any Coupon Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing on or after the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price for such Coupon Security may be reduced by an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons. If thereafter the Holder of such Coupon shall surrender to any Paying Agent outside the United States any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted. The surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless.
 
SECTION 13.7. Debt Securities Redeemed in Part.
 
Any Debt Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the Corporate Trust Office or such other office or agency of the Company as is specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (in the case of Registered Securities), or at such other office or agency of the Company outside the United States as is specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (in the case of Bearer Securities) with, if the Company, the Security Registrar or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Security Registrar and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Debt Security without service charge, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series, of like tenor and form, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Debt Security so surrendered, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with appropriate Coupons attached. In the case of a Debt Security providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holder thereof, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Debt Security or Debt Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Debt Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.
 
SECTION 13.8. Conversion Arrangement in Call for Redemption.
 
In connection with any redemption of Debt Securities of any series, the Company may arrange for the purchase and conversion of any such Debt Securities by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other purchasers to purchase such Debt Securities by paying to the Trustee or the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of such Debt Securities, on or before 10:00 a.m. New York time on the Redemption Date, an amount not less than the Redemption Price, together with interest, if any, accrued to the redemption date of such Debt Securities, in immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XIII, the obligation of the Company to pay the Redemption Price of such Debt Securities, including all accrued interest, if any, shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers. If such an agreement is entered into, any Debt Securities not duly surrendered for conversion by the Holders thereof, at the option of the Company, may be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, acquired by such purchasers from such Holders and surrendered by such purchasers for conversion, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the last Business Day on which such Debt Securities called for redemption may be converted in accordance with this Indenture and the terms of such Debt Securities, subject to payment to the Trustee or Paying Agent of the above-described amount. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall hold and pay to the Holders whose Debt Securities are selected for redemption any such amount paid to it in the same manner as it would pay funds deposited with it by the Company for the redemption of Debt Securities of such series. Without the Trustee's and the Paying Agent's prior written consent, no arrangement between the Company and such purchasers for the purchase and conversion of any Securities shall increase or otherwise affect any of the powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations of the Trustee and the Paying Agent as set forth in this Indenture.
 
 
 
SECTION 14.1. Applicability of Articles.
 
The provisions of this Article XIV shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Debt Securities of a series except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of such series.
 
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, the amount of any cash sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 14.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Debt Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of such series.
 
SECTION 14.2. Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with Debt Securities.
 
In lieu of making all or any part of a mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Debt Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option, at any time no more than sixteen months and no less than 45 days prior to the date on which such sinking fund payment is due, deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities of such series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company, except Debt Securities of such series which have been redeemed through the application of mandatory sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of the Debt Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order instructing the Trustee to credit such obligations and stating that the Debt Securities of such series were originally issued by the Company by way of bona fide sale or other negotiation for value, provided that such Debt Securities shall not have been previously so credited. Such Debt Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
SECTION 14.3. Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund.
 
Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Debt Securities (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency or Currencies in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 14.2 and shall state the basis for such credit and that such Debt Securities have not previously been so credited and whether the Company intends to exercise its rights to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate, the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the right to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in Section 14.2 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series at such time.
 
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Debt Securities of any series), such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price thereof together with accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or such lesser sum) or less and
 
the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser sum) is available.
 
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series shall, subject to the preceding paragraph, be applied by the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) to the redemption of Debt Securities shall be added to the next sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 12.4) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 12.4) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Debt Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of such series at Maturity.
 
The Trustee shall select or cause to be selected the Debt Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 13.3 and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 13.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 13.6.
 
On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (to the extent it is acting as a Paying Agent with respect to Dollars) or other Paying Agent appointed by the Company (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 12.4) in cash a sum, in the Currency or Currencies in which Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.10), equal to the principal and any interest accrued to the Redemption Date for Debt Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.
 
Neither the Trustee, any Paying Agent nor the Company shall redeem any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Debt Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, except that if the notice of redemption shall have been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee or applicable Paying Agent (or the Company, if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee or such other Paying Agent as provided above (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of such series; provided, however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on or prior to the next sinking fund payment date for the Debt Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
 
 
 
SECTION 15.1. Applicability of Article.
 
Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.1, if the Debt Securities of such series are Registered Securities and denominated and payable only in Dollars (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1 and subject to the proviso in the last sentence of this paragraph) then the provisions of this Article shall be applicable. Defeasance provisions, if any, for Debt Securities denominated and/or payable in a Foreign Currency or Currencies or for Bearer Securities may be specified pursuant to Section 3.1; provided, however, that nothing herein or therein shall obligate the Trustee (without its consent, at its sole option) to hold or maintain any account, or act as Paying Agent with respect to, any Foreign Currency or Currencies.
 
SECTION 15.2. Defeasance Upon Deposit of Moneys or U.S. Government Obligations.
 
At the Company's option, either (a) the Company shall be deemed to have been Discharged (as defined below) from its obligations with respect to Debt Securities of any series ("legal defeasance option") or (b) the Company shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 12.5, Section 12.6 and clauses (2) and (4) of Section 10.1 with respect to Debt Securities of any series (and, if so specified pursuant to Section 3.1, any other obligation of the Company or restrictive covenant added for the benefit of such series pursuant to Section 3.1), and any noncompliance with such terms, provisions or covenants shall not constitute a default or Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of that series ("covenant defeasance option"), at any time after the applicable conditions set forth below have been satisfied:
 
(1) the Company shall have deposited or caused to be deposited irrevocably with the Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series (i) money in an amount, or (ii) U.S. Government Obligations (as defined below) which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii), sufficient, in the opinion (with respect to (i), (ii) and (iii)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge each installment of principal (including any mandatory sinking fund payments) of and premium, if any, and interest on, the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series on the dates such installments of interest or principal and premium are due;
 
(2) such deposit shall not cause the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that series to have a conflicting interest as defined in Section 6.8 and for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the Debt Securities of any series;
 
(3) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound;
 
(4) if the Debt Securities of such series are then listed on any national securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel or a letter or other document from such exchange to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option under this Section would not cause such Debt Securities to be delisted;
 
(5) no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and, with respect to the legal defeasance option only, no Event of Default under Section 5.1(5) or Section 5.1(6) or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default under Section 5.1(5) or Section 5.1(6) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after such date; and
 
(6) if the Debt Securities are to be redeemed prior to Stated Maturity (other than from mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments), notice of such redemption shall have been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made; and
 
(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or
 
loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance or Discharge.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option and an Event of Default under Section 5.1(5) or Section 5.1(6) or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default under Section 5.1(5) or Section 5.1(6) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after the date of such deposit, the obligations of the Company referred to under the definition of covenant defeasance option with respect to such Debt Securities shall be reinstated.
 
Notwithstanding the Company's exercise of the covenant defeasance option, the Company may subsequently exercise the legal defeasance option.
 
"Discharged" means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Debt Securities of such series and to have satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture relating to the Debt Securities of such series (and the Trustee for such series of Debt Securities, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except (A) the rights of Holders of Debt Securities of such series to receive, from the trust fund described in clause (1) above, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to the Debt Securities of such series under Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 12.3 and 15.3 and (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder.
 
"U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are (i) direct obligations of the United States for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged, or (ii) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States, which, in either case under clauses (i) or (ii), are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt issued by a bank or trust company as custodian with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of interest on or principal of any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt; provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of interest on or principal of the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.
 
SECTION 15.3. Deposited Moneys and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in Trust.
 
All moneys and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 15.2 in respect of Debt Securities of a series shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of such Debt Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as
 
the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Debt Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
 
SECTION 15.4. Repayment to Company.
 
The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall promptly pay or return to the Company upon Company Request any moneys or U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the same opinion provided pursuant to Section 15.2(1)), are not required for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities of any series for which money or U.S. Government Obligations have been deposited pursuant to Section 15.2.
 
The provisions of the last paragraph of Section 12.4 shall apply to any money held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent under this Article that remains unclaimed for two years after the Maturity of any series of Debt Securities for which money or U.S. Government Obligations have been deposited pursuant to Section 15.2.
 
The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee for any series of Debt Securities against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 15.2 or the interest and principal received in respect of such U.S. Government Obligations other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is payable by or on behalf of Holders. The obligation of the Company under this Section 15.4 shall be deemed to be an obligation of the Company under Section 6.7.
 
 
 
SECTION 16.1. Applicability; Conversion Privilege.
 
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for Debt Securities of any series, the provisions of this Article XVI shall be applicable to any Debt Securities that are convertible into Common Stock. If so provided pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, the Holder of a Debt Security of such series shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert, in accordance with the terms of such series of Debt Securities and this Article XVI, all or any part (in a denomination of, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to Securities of such series, $1,000 in principal amount or any integral multiple thereof) of such Debt Security into shares of Common Stock or, as to any Debt Securities called for redemption, at any time prior to the time and date fixed for such redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price, in which case such right shall not terminate at such time and date).
 
SECTION 16.2. Conversion Procedure; Conversion Price; Fractional Shares.
 
(a) Each Debt Security to which this Article is applicable shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent, and at such other place or places, if any, specified in pursuant to
 
Section 3.1 with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock. The Debt Securities will be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price therefor. No payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock or accrued interest on a converted Debt Security except as described in Section 16.9. The Company may, but shall not be required, in connection with any conversion of Debt Securities, issue a fraction of a share of Common Stock and, if the Company shall determine not to issue any such fraction, the Company shall, subject to Section 16.3(4), make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the last Trading Day prior to the date of conversion.
 
(b) Before any Holder of a Debt Security shall be entitled to convert the same into Common Stock, such Holder shall surrender such Debt Security duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, or, in the case of Bearer Securities, together with all unmatured Coupons and any matured Coupons in default attached thereto, at the office of the Conversion Agent or at such other place or places, if any, specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (in the case of Registered Securities) and at an office of the Conversion Agent or at such other place or places, if any, outside of the United States as is specified pursuant to Section 3.1 (in the case of Bearer Securities), and shall give written notice to the Company at said office or place that he elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Debt Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued; provided, however, that no Debt Security or portion thereof shall be accepted for conversion unless the principal amount of such Debt Security or such portion, when added to the principal amount of all other Debt Securities or portions thereof then being surrendered by the Holder thereof for conversion, exceeds the then effective Conversion Price with respect thereto. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such conversion may be effected if the Bearer Securities to be surrendered for conversion are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however that except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. If more than one Debt Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at said office or place to such Holder of a Debt Security, or to his nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid, together, subject to the last sentence of paragraph (a) above, with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which he would otherwise be entitled. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock while the stock transfer books for such stock
 
or the Security Register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or Security Register. A Debt Security shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of the surrender of such Debt Security for conversion as provided above, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such Common Stock as of the close of business on such date. In case any Debt Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Debt Securities so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 16.8), a new Debt Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debt Security.
 
SECTION 16.3. Adjustment of Conversion Price for Common Stock.
 
The Conversion Price with respect to any Debt Security which is convertible into Common Stock shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
 
(1) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend in shares of its Common Stock to holders of Common Stock, (ii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, (iii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or (iv) make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to holders of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such action shall be adjusted so that the Holders of such Debt Securities, upon conversion thereof into Common Stock immediately following such event, shall be entitled to receive the kind and amount of shares of capital stock of the Company which they would have owned or been entitled to receive upon or by reason of such event if such Debt Securities had been converted immediately before the record date (or, if no record date, the effective date) for such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 16.3(1) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective retroactively immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. For the purposes of this Section 16.3(1), each Holder of Debt Securities shall be deemed to have failed to exercise any right to elect the kind or amount of securities receivable upon the payment of any such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution (provided that if the kind or amount of securities receivable upon such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution is not the same for each nonelecting share, then the kind and amount of securities or other property receivable upon such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution for each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares).
 
(2) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are outstanding, issue rights or warrants to all holders
 
of shares of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for such issuance) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) at a price per share less than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock at such record date (treating the price per share of the securities convertible into Common Stock as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of such security into Common Stock divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible security), the Conversion Price with respect to such Debt Securities shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights or warrants by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are initially convertible), and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of securities which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of securities so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate purchase price of the convertible securities so offered plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon conversion of such securities into Common Stock) would purchase at such Current Market Price of the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants.
 
(3) In the case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are outstanding, distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and the Common Stock is not changed or exchanged) cash, evidences of its indebtedness, securities or assets (excluding (i) regular periodic cash dividends in amounts, if any, determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, (ii) dividends payable in shares of Common Stock for which adjustment is made under Section 16.3(1) or (iii) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company (excluding those referred to in Section 16.3(2))), then in each such case the Conversion Price with respect to such Debt Securities shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date referred to below, and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the cash or assets or evidences of indebtedness or securities so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock (provided that such denominator shall never be less than 1.0); provided however, that no adjustment
 
shall be made with respect to any distribution of rights to purchase securities of the Company if a Holder of Debt Securities would otherwise be entitled to receive such rights upon conversion at any time of such Debt Securities into Common Stock unless such rights are subsequently redeemed by the Company, in which case such redemption shall be treated for purposes of this section as a dividend on the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(4) The Company shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by subsections 16.3(1), 16.3(2), and 16.3(3), as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution of Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above shall not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock for United States Federal income tax purposes.
 
(5) In any case in which this Section 16.3 shall require that any adjustment be made effective as of or retroactively immediately following a record date, the Company may elect to defer (but only for five (5) Trading Days following the filing of the statement referred to in Section 16.5) issuing to the Holder of any Debt Securities converted after such record date the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
 
(6) All calculations under this Section 16.3 shall be made to the nearest cent or one-hundredth of a share of security, with one-half cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16.3, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price. Any adjustments under this Section 16.3 shall be made successively whenever an event requiring such an adjustment occurs.
 
(7) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 16.3, the Holder of any Debt Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of stock of
 
the Company other than shares of Common Stock into which the Debt Securities originally were convertible, the Conversion Price of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Debt Security shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (1) through (6) of this Section 16.3, and the provisions of Sections 16.1, 16.2 and 16.4 through 16.9 with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares and the determination of the Board of Directors as to any such adjustment shall be conclusive.
 
(8) No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section: (i) if the effect thereof would be to reduce the Conversion Price below the par value (if any) of the Common Stock or (ii) subject to 16.3(5) hereof, with respect to any Debt Security that is converted prior to the time such adjustment otherwise would be made.
 
SECTION 16.4. Consolidation or Merger of the Company.
 
In case of either (a) any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the surviving or continuing corporation and which does not result in a reclassification of, or change (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value, as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of Common Stock or (b) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to another Person, then the Conversion Price shall not be adjusted. If any of the events described in the preceding sentence shall occur, the Company shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture to provide that each Debt Security then Outstanding shall be convertible from and after such merger, consolidation, sale or conveyance of property and assets into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Debt Securities would have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article XVI (and assuming such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property (including cash) receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property (including cash) receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance is not the same for each nonelecting share, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property (including cash) receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance for each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares or securities)). The Company shall not enter into any of the transactions referred to in clause (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence unless effective provision shall be made so as to give effect to the provisions set forth in this Section 16.4. The provisions of this Section 16.4 shall apply similarly to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances.
 
SECTION 16.5. Notice of Adjustment.
 
Whenever an adjustment in the Conversion Price with respect to a series of Debt Securities is required:
 
(1) the Company shall forthwith place on file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent for such Securities a certificate of the Treasurer or any Vice President of the Company, stating the adjusted Conversion Price determined as provided herein and setting forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment, such certificate to be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct; and
 
(2) a notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price shall forthwith be given to the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series by the Company, or at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, in the manner provided in Section 1.5. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice.
 
SECTION 16.6. Notice in Certain Events.
 
In case:
 
(1) of a consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or conveyance to another Person or entity or group of Persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company; or
 
(2) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; or
 
(3) of any action triggering an adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article XVI,
 
then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent for the applicable Debt Securities, and shall cause to be given, to the Holders of record of the applicable Debt Securities in the manner provided in Section 1.5, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of any distribution or grant of rights or warrants triggering an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article XVI, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record or Common Stock entitled to such distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, or (y) the date on which any reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up triggering an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article XVI is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their
 
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
 
Failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section.
 
SECTION 16.7. Company to Reserve Stock; Registration; Listing.
 
(a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Debt Securities, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all applicable outstanding Debt Securities into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Debt Securities would be held by a single holder); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall preclude the Company from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of the Debt Securities by delivery of purchased shares of Common Stock which are held in the treasury of the Company. The Company shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, use its best efforts to cause the authorized amount of the Common Stock to be increased if the aggregate of the authorized amount of the Common Stock remaining unissued and the issued shares of such Common Stock in its treasury (other than any such shares reserved for issuance in any other connection) shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all Debt Securities.
 
(b) If any shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon conversion of Debt Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares or securities may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to cause such shares or securities to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. The Company will endeavor to list the shares of Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of the Debt Securities prior to such delivery upon the principal national securities exchange upon which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery.
 
SECTION 16.8. Taxes on Conversion.
 
The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Debt Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or the portion, if any, of the Debt Securities which are not so converted in a name other than that in which the Debt Securities so converted were registered (in case of Registered Securities), and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
 
SECTION 16.9. Conversion After Record Date.
 
If any Debt Securities are surrendered for conversion subsequent to the record date preceding an Interest Payment Date but on or prior to such Interest Payment Date (except Debt
 
Securities called for redemption on a Redemption Date between such record date and Interest Payment Date), the Holder of such Debt Securities at the close of business on such record date shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such Debt Securities on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof. Debt Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any record date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date shall (except in the case of Debt Securities which have been called for redemption on a Redemption Date within such period) be accompanied by payment in New York Clearing House funds or other funds and in the Currency acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Debt Securities being surrendered for conversion. Except as provided in this Section 16.9, no adjustments in respect of payments of interest on Debt Securities surrendered for conversion or any dividends or distributions of interest on the Common Stock issued upon conversion shall be made upon the conversion of any Debt Securities.
 
SECTION 16.10. Conversion of Debt Securities into Preferred Shares or other Securities.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XVI, the Company may issue Debt Securities that are convertible into Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company, including Preferred Shares convertible into Common Stock, in which case all terms and conditions relating to the conversion of Debt Securities into Preferred Shares or other securities, including any terms similar to those provided in Sections 16.1 through 16.12, shall be as provided in or pursuant to an appropriate Board Resolution or in any indenture supplemental hereto or as otherwise contemplated by Section 3.1.
 
SECTION 16.11. Company Determination Final.
 
Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors makes pursuant to this Article is final and conclusive.
 
SECTION 16.12. Trustee's Disclaimer.
 
The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article should be made, how it should be made or what it should be or any duty to determine the correctness of the provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.4. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Debt Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article. Each Conversion Agent other than the Company shall have the same protection under this Section as the Trustee.
 
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed, and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and year first above written.

Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company (55 Water Street, New York, New York) (the "Depositary") to the Company or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary and any payment is made payable to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Missouri (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to , or registered assigns, the principal sum of Dollars on the Stated Maturity Date specified above, and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 in each year, commencing with the Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and at Stated Maturity or redemption, if any, at the Interest Rate per annum, if any, specified above (subject to adjustment upon default as specified below), until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest so payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Senior Indenture, dated as of May 6, 2005 (such Indenture, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Securities, being herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Security shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
 
If any Interest Payment Date, any Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of this Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this Security), payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) due on this Security need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at the Place of Payment, with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the Redemption Date or at Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue on such unpaid interest or principal (and premium, if any) for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
 
If, as specified on the face hereof, this Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security and is redeemable, this Security is subject to redemption at any time on or after the Redemption Commencement Date specified on the face hereof, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at the applicable redemption price (as described below) plus accrued interest to the
 
date fixed for redemption. Such redemption price shall be the Redemption Percentage of the principal amount hereof specified on the face hereof for the twelve-month period commencing on the Redemption Commencement Date and shall decline for the twelve-month period commencing on each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date by a percentage of principal amount equal to the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction specified on the face hereof until such redemption price is 100% of the principal amount of this Security to be redeemed.
 
If, as specified on the face hereof, this Security is an Original Issue Discount Security and is redeemable, this Security is subject to redemption at any time on or after the Redemption Commencement Date specified on the face hereof, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company at the Amortized Face Amount of this Security as of the date fixed for redemption plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Security shall be the amount equal to (a) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof multiplied by the face amount hereof plus (b) that portion of the difference between such amount and the face amount hereof that has accrued at the Yield to Maturity (specified on the face hereof) (computed in accordance with generally accepted United States bond yield computation principles) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated, but in no event shall the Amortized Face Amount of this Security exceed its stated principal amount.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by mail to Holders of Securities in registered form, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series, of like tenor of any authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
If, as specified on the face hereof, this Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security and if an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
If, as specified on the face hereof, this Security is an Original Issue Discount Security and if an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the Amortized Face Amount of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security shall terminate.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the Company's obligations in respect of (i) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company to enter into a supplemental indenture with the Trustee to amend certain provisions thereof and modify the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected and, for certain purposes, without the consent of the Holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, in denominations of $1,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, except as provided in the Indenture, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, or any part thereof, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under this Security or the Indenture, against, and no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture and all the Securities are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a part of the consideration for, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance of the Securities.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Senior Indenture, dated as of May 6, 2005 (such Indenture, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Securities, being herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Security shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement of the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
 
Interest payments on this Security shall be the amount of interest accrued from the last day to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the immediately succeeding Interest Payment Date.
 
Accrued interest on this Security shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Payment Period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal calculated to seven decimal places without rounding) for each such day shall be computed by dividing the
 
interest rate applicable to such day by (a) the actual number of days in the year if the Base Rate is the CMT Rate or the Treasury Rate, as indicated on the face hereof or (b) 360, if the Base Rate is any other rate, as indicated on the face hereof. For purposes of making the foregoing calculation, the interest rate in effect on any day will be: (a) if the day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Rate Determination Date for that Interest Reset Date, or (b) if the day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Rate Determination Date for the preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest hereon shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1% (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with 0.5 of a cent being rounded upward).
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date and thereafter upon each succeeding Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Security is payable shall be reset monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as specified on the face hereof for the Interest Reset Period; and such rate, as so reset, shall be effective as of and for the related Interest Reset Date and for the balance of the related Interest Reset Period to but excluding the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Interest Reset Dates shall be, if the interest rate on this Security resets monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; if the interest rate on this Security resets quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year, if the interest rate on this Security resets semi-annually, the third Wednesday of each of the two months of each year specified on the face hereof; and if the interest rate on this Security resets annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified on the face hereof; , , that the interest rate in effect for the ten calendar days immediately prior to Maturity will be that in effect on the tenth calendar day preceding Maturity. If an Interest Reset Date for this Security would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day (as hereinafter defined), such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is LIBOR or EURIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If an auction date (as described in the definition of Treasury Rate Determination Date below) shall fall on any day that would otherwise be an Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the Business Day immediately following such auction date.
provided
however
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. In addition, the interest rate hereon shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, interest will be payable, if the interest rate on this Security resets monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month; if the interest rate on this Security resets quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; if the interest rate on this Security resets semi-annually, on the third Wednesday of
 
each of the two months of each year specified on the face hereof; and if the interest rate on this Security resets annually, on the third Wednesday of the one month of each year specified on the face hereof (each such day being an "Interest Payment Date").
 
If any Interest Payment Date other than a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity would otherwise be a day that shall not be a Business Day (as hereinafter defined), such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed until the next succeeding Business Day and interest will continue to accrue, except that, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is LIBOR or EURIBOR and such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date is not a Business Day, payments of principal and interest due on this Security may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on such amounts for the period from and after such Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
 
The Company shall appoint, and enter into an agreement with, an agent (the "Calculation Agent") to calculate the interest rates on floating rate Securities (including this Security). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall be the Calculation Agent. All determinations of interest rates by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder hereof.
 
Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date the rate of interest shall be the rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
 
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Commercial Paper Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the Commercial Paper Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The Commercial Paper Rate for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as defined below) and shall be (a) the Money Market Yield (as defined herein) as of the second Business Day prior to the related Interest Reset Date (a "Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date") of the rate for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as such rate shall be published in H.15(519) (as hereinafter defined) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time on the Calculation Date relating to that Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial," or if such rate is not so published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Money Market Yield as of such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as published in H.15 Daily Update (as hereinafter defined) under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial" or (b) if that rate is not published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Money Market Yield of
 
the arithmetic mean, determined after consultation with the Company, of the offered rates, as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date, of three leading dealers in commercial paper in New York City selected by the Company for commercial paper of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "Aa", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency; provided, however, that if fewer than three dealers so selected by the Company are quoting offered rates as described in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be deemed to be the same as the Commercial Paper Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield (expressed as a percentage rounded to the next higher one hundred thousandth of a percentage point) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated.
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.
 
Determination of LIBOR
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to LIBOR, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
"LIBOR" for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent for such LIBOR Note on the second London Business Day (as hereinafter defined) immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date (a "LIBOR Determination Date") as follows:
 
(i) The Calculation Agent shall determine either (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified above as the Reporting Service, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the Interest Reset Date, which appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page ("LIBOR Reuters") or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified above as the Reporting Service, the offered rate on the LIBOR Determination Date for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof that appears on the Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 A.M.
 
London time, on that LIBOR Determination Date ("LIBOR Telerate"). "Reuters Screen LIBO Page" means the display designated as page "LIBO" on the Reuters Money 3000 Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks) "Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as page "3750" on Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on that Service or such other recognized service). If neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified on the face hereof, LIBOR will be determined as if LIBOR Telerate had been specified. On any LIBOR Determination Date, if fewer than two offered rates appear or no rate appears, as applicable, on the designated Reporting Service, LIBOR with respect to that Interest Reset Date will be determined as if the parties had specified the rate described in (ii) below.
 
(ii) The Calculation Agent shall request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotations of its rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof commencing on the Interest Reset Date to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is representative of a single transaction in that index currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are provided, "LIBOR" for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are provided, "LIBOR" for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such LIBOR Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof commencing on such Interest Reset Date, and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in that market at such time; , , that if fewer than three banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting rates as described in this sentence, "LIBOR" for such Interest Reset Period shall be deemed to be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
provided
however
 
Determination of EURIBOR
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is EURIBOR, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to EURIBOR, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
"EURIBOR" for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent for such EURIBOR Note on the second TARGET Settlement Day (as hereinafter defined) immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date (a "EURIBOR Determination Date") as follows:
 
(i) for any EURIBOR Determination Date, EURIBOR shall be the rate for deposits in euros as sponsored, calculated and published jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACIThe Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing those rates, for the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as that rate appears on the display on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, on page 248 or any other page as may replace page 248 on that service, which is commonly referred to as Telerate Page 248, as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time.
 
The following procedures will be followed if the rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
(ii) If the above rate does not appear, the Calculation Agent will request the principal Euro-zone office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered rate for deposits in euros, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market for the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, and in a principal amount not less than the equivalent of U.S.$1 million in euro that is representative of a single transaction in euro, in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
 
(iii) If fewer than two quotations are provided, EURIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the applicable Interest Reset Date for loans in euro to leading European banks for a period of time equivalent to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof commencing on that interest reset date in a principal amount not less than the equivalent of U.S.$1 million in euro.
 
(iv) If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, EURIBOR will remain EURIBOR then in effect on the immediately preceding EURIBOR Determination Date (or, if no such rate is in effect, the interest rate hereon shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
"Euro-zone" means the region comprising member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the relevant treaty of the European Union, as amended.
 
Determination of Treasury Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Treasury Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the Treasury
 
Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The "Treasury Rate" for any Treasury Rate Determination Date (as defined below) for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as defined below) and shall be the rate from the most recent auction of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as such rate appears under the caption "Investment Rate" on the display on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) ("Telerate") on page 56 or 57 (or any other page as may replace such page or such service) or, in the event that such rate is not published prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the bond equivalent yield of the rate for the applicable Treasury bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High." If the rate described in the preceding sentence is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the "Treasury Rate" for such Interest Reset Period shall be the auction average rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) on such Treasury Rate Determination Date as otherwise announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that the results of the auction of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof are not published or reported as provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held in a particular week, then the "Treasury Rate" for such Interest Reset Period shall be the rate set forth in H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market." If the rate described in the preceding sentence is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the "Treasury Rate" will be the rate for the applicable Treasury bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market." If such rate is not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof; , , that if fewer than three of the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting bid rates as described in this sentence, then the "Treasury Rate" for such Interest Reset Period shall be deemed to be the same as the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
provided
however
 
The "Treasury Rate Determination Date" for each Interest Reset Period shall be the day of the week during which the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof would normally be auctioned. As of the date of this Security, Treasury bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the
 
following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Treasury Rate Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Period commencing in the next succeeding week. If an auction date shall fall on any day that would otherwise be an Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Note, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the Business Day immediately following such auction date.
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Treasury Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Treasury Rate Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.
 
Determination of CD Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the CD Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the CD Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The "CD Rate" for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as hereinafter defined) and shall be the rate as of the second Business Day prior to the related Interest Reset Date (a "CD Rate Determination Date") for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time on the Calculation Date under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)," or, if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date relating to such CD Rate Determination Date, the rate on such CD Rate Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15 Daily Update or other recognized electronic source under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)." If such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or other recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CD Rate on such CD Rate Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such CD Rate Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks of the highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; provided, however, that if fewer than three dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate with respect to such CD Rate Determination Date will be the CD Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for the next succeeding Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to a CD Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such CD Rate Determination Date or, if such date is not a
 
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.
 
Determination of Prime Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Prime Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the Prime Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The "Prime Rate" for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as hereinafter defined) and shall be the rate as of the second Business Day prior to the related Interest Reset Date (a "Prime Rate Determination Date") as such rate is published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time on the Calculation Date under the caption "Bank Prime Loan" or, if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Prime Rate Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank Prime Loan." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen USPRIME 1 Page as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate in effect as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates, but more than one such rate, so appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME 1 Page for such Prime Rate Determination Date, the Prime Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the announced prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Determination Date by at least two major money center banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide such rate or rates; provided, however, that if fewer than two such prime rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME 1 Page, there shall be included in the group of rates whose arithmetic mean is to be so determined the prime rates or base lending rates, as of such Prime Rate Determination Date, of three substitute banks or trust companies organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, or any State thereof, in each case having total equity capital of at least U.S. $500,000,000 and being subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company); provided, however, that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate Determination Date will be the Prime Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for the next succeeding Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
"Reuters Screen USPRIME 1 Page" means the display on the Reuters Money 3000 Service (or any successor service) on the "USPRIME1" Page (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on that service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks.
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to a Prime Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Prime Rate Determination Date or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.
 
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Federal Funds Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the Federal Funds Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The "Federal Funds Rate" for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as hereinafter defined) and shall be the rate as of the Business Day prior to the related Interest Reset Date (a "Federal Funds Determination Date") for Federal Funds as such rate is published in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time on the Calculation Date, under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" as such rate is displayed on Telerate Page 120. In the event that such rate is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Federal Funds Determination Date, then the Federal Funds Rate shall be the rate on such Federal Funds Determination Date for U.S. dollar federal funds, as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)." If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transactions in overnight Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) as of 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on that Federal Funds Determination Date; provided, however, that if fewer than three brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting rates as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for the next succeeding Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to a Federal Funds Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Federal Funds Determination Date or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.
 
Determination of CMT Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the CMT Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the CMT
 
Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The CMT Rate for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as defined below) and shall be the rate as of the second Business Day prior to the related Interest Reset Date (a "CMT Rate Determination Date") displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on the designated CMT Telerate Page specified on the face hereof (or any other page that may replace such page on that service) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date for such CMT Rate Determination Date under the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturity... Federal Reserve Board Release H.15 Monday Approximately 3:45 P.M.," under the column for the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for: (i) if the designated CMT Telerate Page is 7051, such CMT Rate Determination Date; or (ii) if the designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the week, or the month, specified on the face hereof, ended immediately preceding the week in which the related CMT Rate Determination Date occurred. If the CMT Rate is not displayed on the relevant page by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate will be the "Treasury Constant Maturity Rate" for the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519); or if such rate is not so published prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be the Treasury Constant Maturity Rate (or other such United States Treasury rate) for the Index Maturity for the CMT Rate Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent reasonably determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the designated CMT Telerate Page and published in H.15(519). If neither of such rates is published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market closing offer side prices, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the CMT Rate Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers (each a "reference dealer,") in The City of New York. The Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) will select five reference dealers and will eliminate the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest quotations) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest quotations), for the most recently issued Treasury notes that are direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States with an original maturity of approximately the Index Maturity and a remaining term to maturity of not less than the Index Maturity minus one year. If the Calculation Agent cannot obtain three Treasury note quotations, the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer side prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the CMT Rate Determination Date of three reference dealers in New York City (selected using the same method described above) for Treasury notes with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Index Maturity and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity and in an amount of at least $100,000,000. If three or four but not five reference dealers are quoting as described above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of these quotations will be eliminated. If fewer than three reference dealers selected as aforesaid are quoting offered rates as described above, the CMT Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be deemed to be the same as the CMT Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or
 
if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any CMT Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such CMT Rate Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.
 
Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, this Security shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at an interest rate calculated with reference to the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, determined as set forth below, and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
 
The Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for each Interest Reset Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Calculation Date (as defined below) and shall be (a) the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date occurs as displayed on the Telerate Page 7058 by 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on the Calculation Date for that Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date under the caption "Eleventh District," or (b) if the rate is not displayed on the relevant page by 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on the Calculation Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions, of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District as announced (the "FHLB Index") by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for the calendar month preceding the date of announcement. If no announcement was made relating to the month preceding the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be deemed to be the same as the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or if no such rate was in effect, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Initial Interest Rate).
 
"Eleventh District Cost of the Funds Rate Determination Date" means the last working day of the month immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco publishes the FHLB Index.
 
The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar date after such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity as the case may be.

If, as specified on the face hereof, this Security is an Original Issue Discount Security and is redeemable, this Security is subject to redemption at any time on or after the Redemption Commencement Date specified on the face hereof, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company at the Amortized Face Amount of this Security as of the date fixed for redemption plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. The "Amortized Face Amount" of this Security shall be the amount equal to (a) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof multiplied by the face amount hereof plus (b) that portion of the difference between such amount and the face amount hereof that has accrued at the Yield to Maturity specified on the face hereof (computed in accordance with generally accepted United States bond yield computation principles) at the date as of which the Amortized Face Amount is calculated, but in no event shall the Amortized Face Amount of this Security exceed its stated principal amount.
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by mail to Holders of Securities in registered form, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series, of like tenor of any authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
