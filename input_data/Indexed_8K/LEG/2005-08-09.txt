Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
 
On August 5, 2005 the Company entered into a new multi-currency revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and all of the participating banking institutions alphabetically listed below. The Company, from time to time, may borrow, repay and re-borrow up to $400 million under the Credit Agreement until July 31, 2010, at which time the Company's ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement will terminate. Below is a listing of the respective commitments of the participating banking institutions under the Credit Agreement.
 
 
The Company may elect the type of borrowing under the Credit Agreement. The type of borrowing will determine the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company is required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the Credit Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period. The Company may borrow, repay and re-borrow under the Credit Agreement at any time prior to the maturity date. All of the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement will be due upon the maturity date. The Company may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
The Credit Agreement is unsecured, but contains certain restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on funded debt and short-term debt of the Company, restrictions on the Company's ability to mortgage and place liens on its property, a requirement that the Company's total debt to total capital must not exceed 60%, and in the case of secured debt, a requirement that the principal amount of secured debt will not exceed 15% of consolidated total assets. The Credit Agreement provides that if the Company breaches any representation or warranty, does not comply with any covenant, fails to pay principal and interest in a timely manner, or if an Event of Default, as defined in the Credit Agreement, otherwise occurs, then the Credit Agreement will terminate and all outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement shall accelerate.
 
The Credit Agreement acts as support for the marketability of the Company's $400 million commercial paper program. However, the Company may borrow under the Credit Agreement independent from the commercial paper program. As of August 8, 2005, the Company had $51.1 million of commercial paper outstanding.
 
The foregoing is only a summary of certain terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The listed banks and/or their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide commercial banking and related services, as well as investment banking, financial advisory and other services to us and/or to our affiliates, for which we have paid, and intend to pay, customary fees, and, in some cases, out-of-pocket expenses.
 
 
On August 5, 2005, in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, as described above, the Company terminated its Revolving Credit Agreement (5-Year Facility), dated August 23, 2002, as amended August 22, 2003 and August 27, 2004 (the "5-Year Agreements") with all of the banking institutions alphabetically listed below. All of the 5-Year Agreements were separate but were substantially identical in all material respects. The amount of credit available under the 5-Year Agreements was $342 million, and each of the 5-Year Agreements would have expired July 31, 2009. As of August 5, 2005, there was no outstanding indebtedness under the 5-Year Agreements.
 
Below is an alphabetical listing of the banks along with their respective revolving credit commitments that were parties to each respective 5-Year Agreement.
 
The Company could have elected the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance under each 5-Year Agreement from:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company was required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under each 5-Year Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period. The Company could borrow, repay and re-borrow under any separate 5-Year Agreement at any time prior to the termination date. All of the outstanding principal under the 5-Year Agreements would have been due upon the termination date. The Company had the ability to terminate any 5-Year Agreement upon three business days notice if no principal was outstanding and all amounts owing to the respective bank had been paid.
 
The 5-Year Agreements were unsecured, but contained certain restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on funded debt and short-term debt of the Company, restrictions on the Company's ability to mortgage and place liens on its property, a requirement that the Company's total debt to total capital could not exceed 50%, and in the case of secured debt, a requirement that the principal amount of secured debt could not exceed 15% of consolidated total assets. The 5-Year Agreements provided that if the Company breached any representation or warranty, did not comply with any covenant, failed to pay principal and interest in a timely manner, or if an Event of Default, as defined in the 5-Year Agreements, otherwise occurred, then the 5-Year Agreements would have terminated and all indebtedness under the 5-Year Agreements would have accelerated. At the time of termination, there was no outstanding indebtedness under the 5-Year Agreements and no termination penalties were incurred by the Company as a result of the termination.
 
The foregoing is only a summary of certain terms and conditions of the 5-Year Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 5-Year Agreements, the form of which was filed with the SEC on September 1, 2004 as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K.
 
The listed banks and/or their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide commercial banking and related services, as well as investment banking, financial advisory and other services to us and/or to our affiliates, for which we have paid, and intend to pay, customary fees, and, in some cases, out-of-pocket expenses.

If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount in the applicable currency in which such Letter of Credit is issued the amount of such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that, if such LC Disbursement is payable in an Available Currency, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Sections 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05, as applicable, that such payment be financed with a Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent amount thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent in dollars its Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent amount of such payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Borrowings as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. To the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank in respect to an LC Disbursement, then all payments by the Borrower thereafter with respect to its reimbursement obligations relating to such LC Disbursement shall be in dollars and in the Dollar Equivalent amount thereof.

The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential

The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
 
(h) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest
provided
 
(i) . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) may demand the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph in an amount in dollars and in immediate available funds equal to the Dollar Equivalent amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Amounts so paid by the Borrower shall be deposited in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

(d) . Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Fixed Rate Borrowing (except Fixed Rate Swingline Borrowings may be continued as Fixed Rate Swingline Borrowings with Interest Periods of seven days' duration) and (ii) unless repaid, each Fixed Rate Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.

Application of Payments
 
(c) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Lender agrees that it will not exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim in an amount in excess of the Loans and other obligations owed directly to such Lender hereunder and in furtherance of the foregoing, any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may not exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation.

Payments Assumed Made
 
Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 8.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations
 
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in future compensation or payments under the applicable Section. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Replacement of a Lender
provided
 
Section 2.20. . By written notice sent to the Administrative Agent (which the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to the Lenders), the Borrower may at any time and from time to time request an increase of the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an aggregate amount equal to any integral multiple of $5,000,000; that (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (ii) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not have been reduced, nor shall the Borrower have given notice of any such reduction under Section 2.09(b); (iii) the total amount of all Commitments shall not be increased to an
Increase of Commitments
provided
 
aggregate amount that would exceed $600,000,000; and (iv) the Commitment of a Lender shall not be increased without the consent of such Lender. If one or more of the Lenders is not increasing its Commitment, then, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders, another one or more financial institutions, each as approved by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a ""), may commit to provide an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the requested increase that will not be provided by the existing Lenders (the ""); , that the Commitment of each New Lender shall be at least $5,000,000. Upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders and the Borrower that the Lenders, or sufficient Lenders and New Lenders, have agreed to commit to an aggregate amount equal to the Increase Amount, then: that no Default exists at such time or after giving effect to the requested increase, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders willing to increase their respective Commitments and the New Lenders (if any) shall execute and deliver an Increased Commitment Supplement (herein so called) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "C". If all existing Lenders shall not have provided their pro rata portion of the requested Increase Amount, the Revolving Loans will not be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Applicable Percentages determined hereunder. To remedy the foregoing, on the date of the effectiveness of the Increased Commitment Supplement, the Lenders shall make advances among themselves so that after giving effect thereto the Revolving Loans will be held by the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with the Applicable Percentages hereunder. The advances so made by each Lender whose Applicable Percentage has increased as a result of the changes to the Commitments shall be deemed to be a purchase of a corresponding amount of the Revolving Loans of the Lender or Lenders whose Applicable Percentages have decreased. The advances made under this Section shall be ABR Revolving Loans made under each Lender's Commitment unless or until the Borrower shall have selected an alternative interest rate to apply thereto under the terms of this Agreement. All advances made under this Section shall be made through the Administrative Agent.

Maximum Interest Rate
 
(a) No interest rate specified in any Loan Document shall at any time exceed the Maximum Rate. If at any time the interest rate (the "") for any obligation under the Loan Documents shall exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the interest accruing on such obligation to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction in the Contract Rate for such obligation shall not reduce the rate of interest on such obligation below the Maximum Rate until the aggregate amount of interest accrued on such obligation equals the aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on such obligation if the Contract Rate for such obligation had at all times been in effect. As used herein, the term "" means, at any time with respect to any Lender, the maximum rate of nonusurious interest under applicable law that such Lender may charge Borrower.

General Provisions
 
 
 
 
[Effective Date]
 
 
Dear Sirs:
 
I refer to the Credit Agreement dated as of August 5, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, a Missouri corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks and other financial institutions identified therein as Lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.
 
As Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Borrower, I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates or statements of public officials and officers of the Borrower and other documents, records and instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal competence and capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.
 
When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied without independent investigation as to matters of fact upon statements of governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Loan Documents and certificates and statements of appropriate representatives of the Borrower.
 
Upon the basis of the foregoing and subject to the limitation of this letter, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Missouri.
 
2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
3. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by the Borrower (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority
 
with respect to the Borrower, except such as may be required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (b) will not violate any law or regulation applicable to the Borrower or the charter, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any order of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Borrower, (c) to the best of my actual knowledge, will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower.
 
4. There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the best of my actual knowledge, overtly threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (a) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) that involve the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
5. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
 
For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed that you are lawfully organized and existing banking associations, having all requisite power and authority and having taken all corporate or other action necessary to execute and deliver the instruments to which you are a party and to effect the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents. I have also assumed that you have duly executed the Credit Agreement and that the Credit Agreement is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of yours.
 
My opinion expressed in paragraph 1 above, to the extent it relates to the legal existence and good standing of the Company in Missouri, is based solely on a confirmation of good standing obtained from the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri and is limited accordingly.
 
I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision in any of the Loan Documents purporting or attempting to (A) confer exclusive jurisdiction and/or venue upon certain courts or otherwise waive the defenses of or improper venue or (B) confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court not having independent grounds therefore or (C) modify or waive the requirements for effective service of process for any action that may be brought or (D) waive the right of the Borrower and any other person to a trial by jury or (E) provide that remedies are cumulative or that decisions by a party are conclusive or (F) modify or waive the rights to notice, legal defenses, statutes of limitations or other benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law.
forum non conveniens
 
I am a member of the bar of the State of Missouri and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Missouri and the Federal laws of the United States of America. For purposes of the opinion expressed in paragraph 2 above, we have assumed with your consent that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of Missouri in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders and Persons that acquire participations in your Loans) without my prior written consent.
 
I am a stockholder and full-time employee and officer of the Borrower.
