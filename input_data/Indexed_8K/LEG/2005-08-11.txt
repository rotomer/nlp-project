Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 9, 2005, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement and a Pricing Agreement (collectively, the "Agreement") with JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Securities, LLC, as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters named therein. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to sell $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Notes due 2015 to the underwriters in a firm commitment underwriting. The notes will be issued under a senior indenture, dated May 6, 2005, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee. The notes will rank equally with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
 
The notes will mature on August 15, 2015 unless earlier redeemed. They will be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2006. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 12 30-day months, and will begin accruing from August 12, 2005.
 
The Company may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, and (ii) as determined by the Company's appointed quotation agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the adjusted treasury rate plus 12.5 basis points plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
 
The net proceeds of approximately $197 million (before deducting expenses of the offering) will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases and/or to fund possible future acquisitions. The transaction is scheduled to close on August 12, 2005.
 
From time to time the underwriters and their affiliates perform investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us and our affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the trustee under the indenture for the notes, is an affiliate of JPMorgan Securities Inc.
 
The offering will only be made by means of a prospectus, which may be obtained from JP Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10017.This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other financial and statistical information and written information furnished by the Agents contained therein or omitted therefrom as to which such counsel need express no opinion) includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Missouri or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Representatives and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (c) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
 
(d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated such date of the Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance substantially satisfactory to the Representatives and the independent accountants of the Company;
 
(e) (i) The Company and its subsidiaries shall not have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any material decrease in the capital stock of the Company or material increase in consolidated long-term debt (as such terms are defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of the Company and its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development that the Company believes would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus on the date hereof relating to the Designated Securities;
 
(f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
 
(g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (v) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other crisis or calamity either within or outside the United States, if the effect on financial markets of any event specified in Clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus on the date hereof relating to the Designated Securities;
 
(h) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
 
(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate of an officer of the Company in such form and executed by such officers of the Company as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the following matters and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request:
(a) (i) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities has been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; (ii) the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and (iv) all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission have been complied with;
 
(b) (i) The Company and its subsidiaries have not sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there has not been any material decrease in the capital stock of the Company or material increase in consolidated long-term debt (as such terms are defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of the Company and its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development that the Company believes would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities.
 
8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss,
provided
however
claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (i) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein or (ii) that is corrected in any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, provided that the Company has performed each of its obligations pursuant to Section 5 hereof in respect of such amendment or supplement and, to the extent that a prospectus relating to the Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933, if such Underwriter, having been furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, thereafter fails to deliver such amended or supplemented Prospectus prior to or concurrently with the delivery of confirmation of the sale of the Securities to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability.
 
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) shall not relieve the indemnifying party from liability under subsection (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.
In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company
notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to all Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on
behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Sections 7(f), 7(g) or 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
 
12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, Attention: Transaction Execution Group, 9th Floor; Fax: (212) 834-6702; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail to No. 1 Leggett Road, Carthage, Missouri 64836, Facsimile Transmission No. (417) 358-8027, Attention: Treasurer (with copies to the Company's General Counsel, Facsimile Transmission No. (417) 358-8449); , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided, however
 
13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. "" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, or any other day on which banks in The City of New York, are generally required or authorized by law or executive order to close.
business day
New York Business Day
 
15. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
 
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Missouri (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS on August 15, 2015, and to pay interest thereon from August 12, 2005 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 in each year, commencing February 15, 2006, and at Stated Maturity or redemption, if any, at the rate of 5.00% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

The Securities of this series are subject to redemption prior to Stated Maturity as described on the reverse hereof.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Senior Indenture, dated May 6, 2005 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Security shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holders hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
 
If any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of this Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or this Security), payment of interest or principal due on this Security need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at the Place of Payment, with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or at Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue on such unpaid interest or principal for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
 
Except as set forth below, this Security is not redeemable prior to Stated Maturity and is not entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund or any analogous provision.
 
This Security is redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of its principal amount, or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 12.5 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for the Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and three additional primary U.S. Government securities dealers in New York City (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by the Company and their successors; provided, however, that if any of them shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, after consultation with the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by that Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage pre-paid, mailed not less than 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to the Holders of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, at each Holder's address appearing in the Security Register, but failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Securities of this series designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof. Any notice that is mailed to the Holders in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities of this series so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the Securities of this series to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of a redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series, of like tenor of any authorized denomination for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder of this Security upon cancellation hereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, Article XIII of the Indenture shall apply to this Security.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may (subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture) be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the Company's obligations in respect of (i) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company to enter into a supplemental indenture with the Trustee to amend certain provisions thereof and modify the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected and, for certain purposes, without the consent of the Holders of any Securities at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of like tenor and of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, except as provided in the Indenture, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered in the Security Register as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard for principles of conflicts of law.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on any Securities, or any part thereof, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under this Security or the Indenture, against, and no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture and all the Securities are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a part of the consideration for, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance of the Securities.

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated
No. 1 Leggett Road
Carthage, Missouri 64836
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
As Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (the "Company"), I have acted on its behalf in connection with the registration of up to $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Company's 5.00% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Notes are Debt Securities being issued pursuant to a Senior Indenture (the "Indenture") entered into between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee, on May 6, 2005. The Company proposes to offer and sell the Notes to the public in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Underwriting Agreement and a Pricing Agreement, each dated August 9, 2005, among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (together, the "Agreements"), each of which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K together with this opinion letter.
 
In connection herewith, I have reviewed and am familiar with the Agreements, the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-123213), filed March 9, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed April 7, 2005 and Amendment No. 2 filed April 15, 2005, which became effective on April 19, 2005 (the "Registration Statement"), and the forms of prospectus supplement and prospectus included or incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Prospectus"), which Registration Statement and Prospectus relate to the offer and sale of the Notes. I have also examined such documents, including resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company dated February 24, 2005, and have made such other investigations and reviewed such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion set forth below. In my examination of the foregoing, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid,

binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. As to questions of fact material to my opinions, I have relied upon certificates or statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and of public officials and authorities. I have assumed without investigation that any certificates or statements on which I have relied that were given or dated earlier than the date of this opinion letter continued to remain accurate, insofar as relevant to such opinion, from such earlier date through and including the date of this letter.
 
Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action and, when executed and authenticated as specified in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor in the manner deemed to be described in the Registration Statement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications and exceptions:
 
 
 
My opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the States of Missouri and New York and the federal laws of the United States of America.
 
I hereby consent to the use of my name in the Registration Statement and in the related prospectus, and in any supplement to such prospectus, and to the use of this Opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.
