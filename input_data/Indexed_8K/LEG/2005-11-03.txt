On November 2, 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Company's existing share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's $.01 par value common stock from 10,000,000 shares up to 15,000,000 shares during calendar year 2005. Beginning January 1, 2006, this repurchase authorization will return to the 10,000,000 share per year level, and will automatically renew each successive January 1 at the 10,000,000 share level, unless otherwise amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. A specific repurchase schedule has not been established under the authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases will depend upon economic and market conditions, acquisition activity and other factors. The share purchase authorization is discussed in the Company's press release, dated November 2, 2005, attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: NOVEMBER 2, 2005
 
 
Carthage, MO, November 2, 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
Diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt's Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the number of shares the company may repurchase in 2005. The previous limit of 10 million shares was increased to 15 million shares. As of today, the company had repurchased 8.3 million shares during 2005, including the purchase of 4.3 million shares within the last seven weeks. The higher authorization allows the company to continue purchasing shares at an accelerated pace through the end of this year.
 
This latest Board authorization affects the calendar year 2005 alone. The Board's authorization for the purchase of up to 10 million shares in 2006, and for each year thereafter, remains unchanged. As first mentioned in September, 2004, the company's priority is to use cash to fund internal growth and acquisitions, and to extend its record of annual dividend increases. Any cash that remains may be used to repurchase shares; however, the repurchase of shares will fluctuate with earnings, capital spending, the pace of acquisitions, share price and debt issuance.
 
In September, 2004, Leggett also stated its intention to increase net debt
(1)
(as a percent of total net capital) back toward the low end of its long-term target range of 30%-40% while maintaining its longstanding "A" credit rating. Net debt-to-cap was 21.9% at the end of 2004. Given recent acquisitions and share repurchase activity, net debt-to-cap could reach the 30% level by year end.
