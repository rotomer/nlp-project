FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: APRIL 20, 2006

Fortune 500 diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt reported earnings of $.33 per diluted share for the first quarter, at the upper end of the 28-33 cent guidance range issued on January 26. First quarter earnings include 4 cents per share for restructuring-related expenses. Per share earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were $.37, and included 1 cent per share for restructuring-related expenses.
Record quarterly sales of $1.38 billion were 5.9% higher than in the first quarter 2005, as a result of recent acquisitions. Same location sales increased about 1%. Acquisitions increased sales by about 6%, but were partially offset by a 1% decline in sales due to restructuring activity.
2006: On Track
Chairman and CEO Felix E. Wright commented, "On a variety of fronts, we are making the advances we expected to make, enabling us to post first quarter earnings at the upper end of our guidance. We are achieving solid progress on our restructuring initiative, and expect the project to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter.
"We set a new record for first-quarter sales, and EPS was at the upper end of our expectations. Cash flow remains strong, with cash from operations at $148 million for the quarter, a 63% improvement over last year due to our ongoing working capital initiatives. We continue to use cash to fund internal growth, make acquisitions, buy our stock, and pay dividends to shareholders. Our first quarter dividend was 7% higher than in 2005, extending Leggett's string of consecutive annual dividend increases to 35 years.
"We remain optimistic about 2006, and expect to post record sales and earnings. Sales should grow about 5%, and we project a 15% - 35% increase in full year earnings per share."
Two Recent Acquisitions
The company has completed two acquisitions so far this year. Both are in the Residential Furnishings segment, and together should contribute about $53 million in annual revenues.
The largest, a producer of rubber carpet cushioning, has annual sales of about $47 million. This transaction was completed in early April and should significantly enhance Leggett's position in the industry. Leggett is the largest provider of carpet underlay in North America, and the only manufacturer of all major types of carpet cushioning material. In total, carpet underlay represents approximately 6% of Leggett's revenues.
In mid-March, Leggett acquired a distributor of geotextiles (synthetic fabrics used in drainage protection, ground stabilization, erosion and weed control) with annual sales of approximately $6 million. This transaction complements last year's acquisitions by expanding the company's presence in geotextiles to the West Coast. With this acquisition, Leggett's annual volume in the highly fragmented market should exceed $100 million.
Significant Restructuring Progress
Last fall Leggett identified 36 operations for closure or consolidation; that activity is expected to be substantially complete by mid-year. Restructuring-related costs should total approximately $75 million ($55 million in 2005; $20 million expected in 2006). These cost estimates do not incorporate potential benefits from the sale of buildings, real estate, or equipment. Once completed, the ongoing annual EBIT benefit from this activity is expected to be about $30-35 million.
Leverage
In September, 2004, Leggett announced its intent to increase leverage (i.e. net debt as a percent of net capitalization) toward the company's long-standing target range of 30%-40% while maintaining its decade-long "single A" credit rating. Net debt to net capital has increased from 21.9% at year-end 2004 to 26.8% as of March 31, 2006. Following the early April acquisition, net debt to net capital was about 28%.
Stock Repurchase
In 2005, Leggett used $227 million to purchase 10.3 million shares of its stock. The cost, on average, was about $23 per share. Shares outstanding declined by 8.3 million shares, or 4.3%, to 182.6 million shares at year end. During the first quarter the company purchased an additional 0.9 million shares, but issued 0.6 million shares through benefit plans; shares outstanding declined to 182.3 million.
2006 Outlook Unchanged: $1.50-$1.75 EPS
The company's outlook for 2006 has not changed. Earnings growth in 2006 should be primarily influenced by three factors: the level of cost structure improvement (from restructuring efforts), sales growth, and Leggett's ability to recover potential raw material cost increases. For planning purposes, the company is assuming 2006 total sales growth of about 5%. Same location sales growth is expected to be modest, with unit volume and market share gains partially offset by changes in product mix and some isolated price deflation. Acquisitions are expected to contribute about 5% to sales growth, but will be partially offset by a $90 million, or 2%, decline in revenue due to the company's restructuring and divestiture activity.
In 2006, the company expects margin improvement in four of its five segments. The gains should come primarily from operational improvements and lower restructuring costs. In addition, restructuring and consolidation activity is expected to eventually increase annual earnings by $.10-.12 per share, with at least half of that benefit realized during 2006. In the Industrial Materials segment, margin is expected to decline, largely due to lower selling prices and a lower steel scrap-to-rod price spread. Together, the anticipated sales growth and margin improvements are projected to result in full year 2006 earnings of $1.50-$1.75 per share, a 15% - 35% improvement over 2005.
For the second quarter, Leggett anticipates trade sales of $1.38-1.43 billion, a sequential improvement of $0-50 million over first quarter (equal to about 7% sales growth versus 2Q 2005). Restructuring costs for 2Q are estimated at about 3 cents per share. Based on these assumptions, the company anticipates earnings of $.39-$.44 per share for the second quarter.
 First Quarter 2006 (versus 1Q 2005)
SEGMENT RESULTS
 Total sales increased $53 million, or 8%, with acquisitions (net of divestitures) contributing $43 million of the increase, and restructuring activity eliminating $14 million in revenue. Same location sales increased 3%. EBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) increased $1.8 million, or 3%. Higher restructuring-related costs ($8.7 million in 2006 vs. $3.7 million in 2005) were more than offset by increased sales and restructuring-related operational improvements.
Residential Furnishings
 Total sales increased $2 million, or almost 1%, with one-half of the growth attributable to acquisitions. EBIT declined $2.3 million, or 18%; restructuring-related costs (of $1.0 million) were the largest single factor affecting earnings.
Commercial Fixturing and Components
 Total sales increased $6 million, or 5%. There have been no acquisitions within the last 12 months. EBIT increased $1.7 million, or 14%, as gains from higher sales and operational improvements were partially offset by higher energy expenses and start up costs (as anticipated) at the new die-casting facility in Auburn, Alabama.
Aluminum Products
 Total sales decreased $29 million, or 13%, due to unit volume and price declines. There have been no acquisitions within the last 12 months. EBIT declined $14.8 million, or 46%, as a result of lower revenue, billet welder start-up costs, increased energy and transportation costs, and restructuring-related costs (of $0.5 million).
Industrial Materials
 Total sales increased $23 million, or 14%. Acquisitions (net of divestitures) contributed $37 million to sales, but were partially offset by a 4% decline in same location sales. EBIT declined $3.7 million, or 39%, in part due to reduced organic sales, currency exchange rates, and restructuring-related costs (of $1.0 million).
