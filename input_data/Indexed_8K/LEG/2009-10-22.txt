Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: OCTOBER 22, 2009
Carthage, MO, October 22 
 
 
 
 
 
Diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt reported third quarter earnings from Continuing Operations of $.34 per share. Earnings improved $.05 per share (versus third quarter 2008) despite much lower sales, as a result of cost reduction efforts, pricing discipline, a LIFO benefit, and absence of last year's unusual tax items. Third quarter sales from Continuing Operations were $810 million, 28% lower than last year's third quarter sales of $1.13 billion due to continuing weak market demand and steel-related price deflation.
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $142 million. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is $430 million, already exceeding the $250 million annual requirement to fund dividends and capital expenditures.
Third quarter gross margin was 23.1% and EBIT margin was 11.7%. Cost reduction efforts and pricing discipline contributed significantly to improved margins. As anticipated, these margins are much better than those of the first and second quarters of 2009, in part due to third quarter's net LIFO benefit of approximately $11 million ($16 million LIFO benefit less $5 million of higher-cost steel). As mentioned in previous quarters, the first half of the year was negatively impacted by steel deflation. This impact is being offset by a LIFO benefit, spread evenly over the four quarters of the year; however, the timing mismatch of these two offsetting items depresses first and second quarter margins, and enhances third and fourth quarter margins.
Strategic Progress Amid Economic Turmoil
President and CEO David S. Haffner commented, "In November of 2007, we announced our intent to accomplish three things: i) narrow our focus by divesting certain of our operations, ii) improve our margins, and iii) then begin to carefully and conservatively grow the company. We spent most of 2008 concentrating primarily on the divestitures, which brought in over $420 million of after-tax cash proceeds. Consistent with our stated intentions, over the last five quarters we've spent nearly $300 million of those proceeds to repurchase our stock.
"Starting in late 2008, and throughout 2009, we have been intently focused on improving our margins. In 2008 our full year EBIT margin, adjusted for unusual items, was 6.5% on sales of $4.1 billion. At the end of 2009 we anticipate an EBIT margin run rate (excluding the net LIFO benefit) between 8

% and 9%, on annualized sales of $3.0 billion. That's over 200 basis points of margin improvement despite a 25% decline in sales. We will continue to focus on margins during 2010 and beyond. Even if revenues remain flat at about $3.0 billion, our 2010 EBIT margin should exceed 9%.
"Longer-term, as markets recover, we believe that $2 of EPS is achievable by 2012. We base this expectation on the following assumptions: an EBIT margin of 8

- 9% as we exit 2009, an economic recovery-driven increase in annual sales to approximately $3.6 billion (a level about 20% above the current year), a contribution margin of 25-35% from those incremental sales, and stock repurchases.
 
"Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We now expect our 2009 operating cash flow to exceed $500 million, in large part due to our efforts to optimize working capital. During the quarter we used $80 million to purchase another 4.4 million shares of our stock. At quarter's end our net debt had declined to 23.7% of net capital (well below our long-term target range), we had virtually no short term debt (but had $600 million available to us), and we have no significant long-term debt maturing until 2013.
"On the other hand, weak demand continues across our businesses; though stable, markets show few signs of improvement. We remain well positioned, from both balance sheet and cost structure perspectives, to ride out the demand downturn. Our main financial goal is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return (TSR

) within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. As measured from 12/31/07, our 23% TSR ranks within the top 3% of the S&P 500 as of yesterday's market close."
Dividend and Stock Repurchases
During the quarter Leggett increased its quarterly dividend by $.01 (or 4%), to $.26. At yesterday's closing share price of $19.26, the indicated annual dividend of $1.04 per share generates a dividend yield of 5.4%.
During the third quarter, the company repurchased 4.4 million shares of its stock at an average of $18.40 per share, and issued 0.3 million shares through employee benefit plans. As a result, shares outstanding decreased by 4.1 million shares to 152.3 million. The company has standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase 10 million shares of its stock each year; if it chooses to, the company could purchase up to 4.1 million additional shares by year end under the 2009 authorization.
2009 Outlook
Leggett projects full year sales (from Continuing Operations) of approximately $3.0 billion (unchanged from prior guidance). Earnings per share (from Continuing Operations) for the full year 2009 are expected to be $.65 - $.75 (versus prior guidance of $.55 - $.70). Improvement stems largely from increased margin expectations (as a result of successful cost reduction activity). Guidance includes $.08 of unusual expenses incurred earlier this year from two significant events (explained in more detail in the July earnings press release): i) the bad debt expense related to a customer bankruptcy, and ii) the write-down of a note associated with the Aluminum Segment divestiture.
LIFO
All of Leggett's segments use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method for valuing inventories. An adjustment is made at the corporate level to convert about 60% of the inventories to the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method. Since the LIFO benefit is not recorded at the segment level, 2009 segment EBIT margins will be unusually low. Steel cost decreases contribute to an anticipated LIFO benefit of $69 million for the full year (for Continuing Operations), which contrasts with $62 million of LIFO expense in 2008. Earnings for the third quarter reflect a LIFO benefit of $16.0 million, compared to LIFO expense of $19.7 million in 3Q 2008.
 Third Quarter 2009 (versus 3Q 2008)
SEGMENT RESULTS
 Total sales decreased $137 million, or 24%, as a result of weak market demand and steel-related price deflation. EBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) decreased $23 million, with the income impact of significantly lower unit volumes partially offset by cost reductions.
Residential Furnishings
 Total sales decreased $56 million, or 28%, due to the company's decision to walk away from sales with unacceptable profit margins, market softness in office furniture components, and reduced spending by retailers. EBIT increased $2 million, with the earnings impact of lower sales more than offset by cost reductions and manufacturing improvements.
Commercial Fixturing & Components
 
 
 Total sales decreased $121 million, or 41%, as a result of weak demand and steel-related price deflation. EBIT decreased $12 million, with the impact of lower unit volumes partially offset by cost reductions.
Industrial Materials
 Total sales decreased $47 million, or 28%. Weak global demand in all parts of the segment  automotive, machinery, and commercial vehicle products  led to the decline. EBIT declined $3 million due to lower sales, and was partially offset by cost reductions.
