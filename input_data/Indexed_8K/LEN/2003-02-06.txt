Except as set forth in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), neither the Company nor any of the subsidiaries has been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. (aa) In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).

The Company and its subsidiaries have not incurred any unpaid liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for the payment of premiums in the ordinary course) or to any such plan under Title IV of ERISA. (cc) The subsidiaries listed on Annex A attached hereto are the only significant subsidiaries of the Company as defined by Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.

There are no rights of third parties to any such Intellectual Property; there is no material infringement by third parties of any such Intellectual Property; there is no pending or, to the Company's best knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the Company's rights in or to any such Intellectual Property, and the Company is unaware of any facts which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim; there 8
is no pending or, to the Company's best knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the validity or scope of any such Intellectual Property, and the Company is unaware of any facts which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim; there is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others that the Company infringes or otherwise violates any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights of others, and the Company is unaware of any other fact which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim; there is no U.S. patent or published U.S. patent application which contains claims that dominate or may dominate any Intellectual Property described in the Final Prospectus as being owned by or licensed to the Company or that interferes with the issued or pending claims of any such Intellectual Property; and there is no prior art of which the Company is aware that may render any U.S. patent held by the Company invalid or any U.S. patent application held by the Company unpatentable which has not been disclosed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. (ee) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, the Company does not have any material lending or other relationship with any bank or lending affiliate of any of the Underwriters. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder for the purposes described in the Final Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds." (ff) There are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to include any securities with the Securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter. 2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of $976.37 per Security of $1,000 principal amount, plus amortization of original issue discount, if any, on the Securities from February 5, 2003, to the Closing Date, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto. 3.

Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made at 10:00 AM, New York City time, on February 5, 2003, or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the 9
Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. 4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Final Prospectus. 5. Agreements. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that: (a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not, unless the Company has been advised by legal counsel that such filing is required by law, file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object in a timely manner. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, shall have become effective, (2) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (3) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (4) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (5) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (6) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect 10
such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act. (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of each Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Salomon Smith Barney Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, of any debt securities, for a period of 5 days after the Execution Date. (g) Neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or which has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. 6.

as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter (the "Initial Letter") of Deloitte & Touche LLP addressed to the Representatives and dated the date hereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, substantially to the effect set forth in Annex B hereto.

(h) At or prior to the Execution Time, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter substantially in the form of Annex C hereto from Stuart A.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Salomon Smith Barney on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives 14
specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability, which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (A) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (B) the sentences relating to concessions and reallowances and (C) in the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate 15
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 16
9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. General Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 17

Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings.

Beneficial interests in the Global Securities shall be credited by the Depositary to the accounts of its participants only in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. SECTION 3.02. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein but subject to the provisions of Section 3.03 below, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Notes, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.08 of the 9
Indenture, only to a nominee of the Depositary for such Global Security, or to the Depositary, or a successor Depositary for such Global Security appointed by the Company, or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.

If a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or its agent, upon receipt of a written request by the Company for the authentication and delivery of individual Notes in exchange for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver, individual Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. (2) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Notes or any portion thereof issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written request by the Company for the authentication and delivery of individual Notes in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver individual Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities representing such series or portion thereof in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. (3) If specified by the Company with respect to Notes issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for individual Notes in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or its agent shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (a) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Note or Notes of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (b) to such Depositary a new Global Security in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Notes delivered to the Holders thereof. (4) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company shall execute and the Trustee or its agent shall authenticate and deliver individual Notes in definitive registered form in authorized denominations. Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of a Global Security for individual Notes, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee or its agent.

The Trustee or the Registrar shall deliver such Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are so registered. 10

The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any Lien, upon any of its properties or assets, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, unless (1) if such Lien secures Indebtedness which is pari passu with the Notes, then the Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligation so secured until such time as such obligation is no longer secured by a Lien, (2) if such Lien secures Indebtedness which is subordinated to the Notes, then the Notes are secured and the Lien securing such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Lien granted to the holders of the Notes to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or (3) such Lien is a Permitted Lien (as defined below). The following Liens constitute "Permitted Liens": (a) Liens on property of a Person existing at the time such Person is merged into or consolidated with or otherwise acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that such Liens were in existence prior to, and were not created in contemplation of, such merger, consolidation or acquisitions and do not extend to any assets other than those of the Person merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; (b) Liens on property existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such Liens were in existence prior to, and were not created in contemplation of, such acquisition and do not extend to any assets other than the property acquired; (c) Liens imposed by law such as carriers', warehouseman's or mechanics' Liens, and other Liens to secure the performance of statutory obligations, surety or appeal bonds, performance bonds or other obligations of a like nature incurred in the ordinary course of business; (d) Liens incurred in connection with pollution control, industrial revenue, water, sewage or any similar bonds; (e) Liens securing Indebtedness representing, or incurred to finance, the cost of acquiring, constructing or improving any assets, provided that the principal amount of such Indebtedness does not exceed 100% of such cost, including construction charges; (f) Liens securing Indebtedness (A) between a Restricted Subsidiary and the Company, or (B) between Restricted Subsidiaries; (g) Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business to secure performance of obligations with respect to statutory or regulatory requirements, performance or return-of-money bonds, surety bonds or other obligations of a like nature, in each case which are not incurred in connection with the borrowing of money, the obtaining of advances or credit or the payment of the deferred purchase price of property and which do not in the aggregate impair in any material respect the use of property in the operation of the Company's business taken as a whole; 11
(h) pledges or deposits under workmen's compensation laws, unemployment insurance laws or similar legislation, or good faith deposits in connection with bids, tenders, contracts (other than for the payment of indebtedness) or leases to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party, or deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of the Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary or deposits for the payment of rent, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business; (i) Liens granted to any bank or other institution on the payments to be made to such institution by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any interest rate swap or similar agreement or foreign currency hedge, exchange or similar agreement designed to provide protection against fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, respectively, provided that such agreements are entered into in, or are incidental to, the ordinary course of business; (j) Liens arising solely by virtue of any statutory or common law provision relating to banker's Liens, rights of set off or similar rights and remedies; (k) Liens arising from the Uniform Commercial Code financing statements regarding leases; (l) Liens securing indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, development or expansion of a property which is given within 180 days of the acquisition, construction, improvement, development or expansion of such property and which is limited to such property; (m) Liens incurred in connection with Non-Recourse Indebtedness; (n) Liens existing on the Issue Date; (o) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or claims that are not yet delinquent or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently concluded; provided that any reserve or other appropriate provision as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor; (p) Liens securing refinancing Indebtedness; provided that any such Lien does not extend to or cover any property or assets other than the property or assets securing Indebtedness so refunded, refinanced or extended; (q) easements, rights-of-way and other similar encumbrances incurred in the ordinary course of business and encumbrances consisting of zoning restrictions, licenses, restrictions on the use of property or minor imperfections in title thereto which, in the aggregate, are not material in amount, and which do not in any case materially detract from the Company's properties subject thereto; and (r) any extensions, substitutions, modifications, replacements or renewals of the Permitted Liens described above. 12
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, and may permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its properties or assets without equally and ratably securing the Notes if the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness then outstanding secured by such Lien and all similar Liens, together with the aggregate net sale proceeds from all Sale-Leaseback Transactions which are not Permitted Sale-Leaseback Transactions, does not exceed 20% of the total consolidated stockholders' equity of the Company as shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet that is contained or incorporated in the latest annual report on Form 10-K (or equivalent report) or quarterly report on Form 10-Q (or equivalent report) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is as of a date not more than 181 days prior to the date of determination, in the case of the consolidated balance sheet contained or incorporated in an annual report on Form 10-K, or 135 days prior to the date of determination, in the case of the consolidated balance sheet contained in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q; provided that Indebtedness secured by Permitted Liens shall not be included in the amount of such secured Indebtedness.

(6) a Sale-Leaseback Transaction which has a lease of no more than three years in length. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, and may permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, effect any Sale-Leaseback Transaction involving any real or tangible personal property which is not a Permitted Sale-Leaseback Transaction, provided that the aggregate net sales proceeds from all Sale-Leaseback Transactions which are not Permitted Sale-Leaseback Transactions, together with all Indebtedness secured by Liens other than Permitted Liens, does not exceed 20% of the total consolidated stockholders' equity of the Company as shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet that is contained or incorporated in the latest annual report on Form 10-K (or equivalent report) or quarterly report on Form 10-Q (or equivalent report) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is as of a date not more than 181 days prior to the date of determination, in the case of the consolidated balance sheet contained or incorporated in an annual report on Form 10-K, or 135 days prior to the date of determination, in the case of the consolidated balance sheet contained in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. ARTICLE FIVE REMEDIES SECTION 5.01. Additional Events of Default. In addition to the applicable Events of Default set forth in Section 6.01 of the Indenture, any one of the following events shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder and thereunder whenever used with respect to the Notes in this Supplemental Indenture (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) a default by the Company in the payment when due of interest on the Notes, which default continues for a period of 30 days; (2) a default by the Company in the payment when due of the principal or Redemption Price due with respect to the Notes; (3) a default by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with respect to its obligation to pay Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness which is non-recourse to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary), which default shall have resulted in the acceleration of, or be a failure to pay at final maturity, Indebtedness aggregating more than $50 million; (4) a failure to perform any other covenant or warranty of the Company herein and in the Indenture, which continues for 30 days after written notice as provided in Section 6.01 of the Indenture; (5) final judgments or orders are rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary which require the payment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of an amount (to the extent not covered by insurance) in excess of $50 million and such judgments or 14
orders remain unstayed or unsatisfied for more than 60 days and are not being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; or (6) any event described in Sections 6.01(4) or 6.01(5) of the Indenture shall occur with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary. SECTION 5.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, unless the principal of the Notes has already become due and payable, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the outstanding principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration on all of the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5) of the Indenture or Section 5.01(6) of this Supplemental Indenture occurs and is continuing, the outstanding principal amount of the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, by notice to the Company and the Trustee (and without notice to any other Holder), may rescind any acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the outstanding principal amount of any of the Notes that has become due solely as a result of acceleration and if all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.07 of the Indenture have been paid. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Supplemental Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Holders of Notes, and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Holders of Notes, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken. The Trustee shall within 90 days after a Trust Officer has knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or any Event of Default, mail to all Holders, as the names and addresses of such Holders appear upon the Note register, notice of all Defaults or Events of Default known to a Trust Officer, unless such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived before the giving of such notice and provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal, interest or Redemption Price, as the case may be, on any of the Notes, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors and/or officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to the limitations specified in the Indenture. 15

When (1) the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes theretofore authenticated (other than any Notes which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) and not theretofore canceled, or (2) all the Notes not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have become due and payable, or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year, and the Company shall deposit with the Trustee, in trust, monies sufficient to pay at the Final Maturity Date (other than any Notes which shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including the principal amount and interest accrued to the Final Maturity Date, and if the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Notes (except as to (i) remaining rights of registration of transfer, substitution and exchange of Notes, (ii) rights hereunder of Holders to receive payments of the principal amount, including interest due with respect to the Notes and the other rights, duties and obligations of Holders, as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (iii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and under the Indenture with respect to the Notes), and the Trustee, on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as required by Section 6.03 and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Notes; the Company, however, hereby agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee and to compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly rendered by the Trustee in connection with the Indenture with respect to the Notes, this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes. SECTION 6.02. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 8.02 of the Indenture by reason of any order or judgment of any court of governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture shall be revived and reinstated with respect to the Notes as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 6.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 of the Indenture, provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal amount or Redemption Price of or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. 16
SECTION 6.03. Officers' Certificate; Opinion of Counsel. Upon any application or demand by the Company to the Trustee to take any action under Section 6.01, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with. Each such Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel provided for in this Supplemental Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant pursuant to the previous paragraph shall comply with the provisions of Section 12.05 of the Indenture. ARTICLE SEVEN SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES SECTION 7.01. With Consent of Holders. In addition to those matters described in Section 9.02 of the Indenture which require the consent of the Holder so affected to amend, supplement or waive any provision of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture, without the consent of the Holder so affected, the Company and the Trustee may not: (1) without the consent of the Holder of each Note so affected, extend the fixed maturity of any Note or any installment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount, interest rate, Redemption Price, or amount due upon acceleration, impair the right of a Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, change the currency in which the Notes are payable, (2) release any Guarantor except as provided in Article Eight hereof, or (3) without the consent of the Holders of all of the Notes then outstanding, reduce the aforesaid percentage of Notes the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. Except as set forth in this Article Seven to the contrary, the terms in Article Nine of the Indenture shall govern. ARTICLE EIGHT GUARANTEE OF NOTES SECTION 8.01. Unconditional Guarantee. Each Guarantor, if any, hereby jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees (such guarantee to be referred to herein as a "Guarantee") to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, that: (a) all amounts due with respect to the Notes shall be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations of the Company or the Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder and all other obligations shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of 17
payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders under this Supplemental Indenture or under the Notes, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default under this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under this Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company. Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Supplemental Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Note, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes, this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and this Guarantee. This Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article Eight, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Five hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. No stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator, past, present or future, of any Guarantor, as such, shall have any personal liability under this Guarantee by reason of his, her or its status as such stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount pro rata, based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with GAAP. SECTION 8.02. Limitations on Guarantees; Release or Suspension of Particular Guarantors' Obligations. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Supplemental Indenture, will result in the 18
obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. The Guarantors shall include (i) each of the Guarantors named on the signature pages of this Supplemental Indenture, (ii) each of the Company's Subsidiaries that in the future executes a supplemental indenture in which such Subsidiary agrees to be bound by the terms hereof as a Guarantor; and (iii) any subsidiary that is a "Restricted Subsidiary" pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 3, 2000, by and among the Company, the guarantors named therein and the Trustee, relating to the Company's 9.95% Senior Notes due 2009, whether formed or acquired after the Issue Date, that guarantees any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that if any Guarantor is released from its guarantee of the outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, such Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations as Guarantor, and from and after such date, such Guarantor shall cease to constitute a Guarantor and, provided further, that during any period when the principal amount of the Company's or any Restricted Subsidiary's obligations other than the Notes that the Guarantor is guaranteeing totals, in the aggregate, less than $75 million, the obligations of such Guarantor as Guarantor shall be automatically suspended, and such Guarantor shall not constitute a Guarantor, for such period. SECTION 8.03. Execution and Delivery of Guarantee. To further evidence the Guarantee set forth in Section 8.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees to execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guarantee in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto. Such Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of each Guarantor by either manual or facsimile signature of an officer of each Guarantor, each of whom, in each case, shall have been duly authorized to so execute by all requisite corporate action. The validity and enforceability of any Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any Note or Notes. If an officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Supplemental Indenture or a Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which such Guarantee is endorsed or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Note shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor. SECTION 8.04. Release of a Guarantor due to Extraordinary Events. If no Default exists or would exist under the Indenture, upon the sale or disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or upon the consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into any Person (in each case, other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company or Subsidiary), or if any Guarantor is dissolved or liquidated, such Guarantor and each Subsidiary of such Guarantor that is also a Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article Eight without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. 19
The Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably requested by the Company or a Guarantor in order to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee endorsed on the Notes under this Article Eight. Nothing contained in the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor. SECTION 8.05. Waiver of Subrogation. Until this Supplemental Indenture is discharged and all of the Notes are discharged and paid in full, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's obligations under the Notes or this Supplemental Indenture and such Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee and this Supplemental Indenture, in any such instance including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Holders against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and any amounts owing to the Trustee or the Holders of Notes under the Notes, this Supplemental Indenture, or any other document or instrument delivered under or in connection with such agreements or instruments, shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Trustee or the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of itself or such Holders to be credited and applied to the obligations in favor of the Trustee or the Holders, as the case may be, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Supplemental Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 8.05 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. SECTION 8.06. No Set-Off. Each payment to be made by a Guarantor hereunder in respect of the Obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such Obligations are denominated, and shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind or nature. SECTION 8.07. Obligations Absolute. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are and shall be absolute and unconditional and any monies or amounts expressed to be owing or payable by each Guarantor hereunder which may not be recoverable from such Guarantor on the basis of a Guarantee shall be recoverable from such Guarantor as a primary obligor and principal debtor in respect thereof. SECTION 8.08. Obligations Continuing. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and shall remain in full force and effect until all the obligations have been paid and satisfied in full. Each Guarantor agrees with the Trustee that it will from time to time 20
deliver to the Trustee suitable acknowledgments of its continued liability hereunder and under any other instrument or instruments in such form as counsel to the Trustee may advise and as will prevent any action brought against it in respect of any default hereunder being barred by any statute of limitations now or hereafter in force and, in the event of the failure of a Guarantor so to do, it hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee the attorney and agent of such Guarantor to make, execute and deliver such written acknowledgment or acknowledgments or other instruments as may from time to time become necessary or advisable, in the judgment of the Trustee on the advice of counsel, to fully maintain and keep in force the liability of such Guarantor hereunder. SECTION 8.09. Obligations Not Reduced. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be satisfied, reduced or discharged except solely by the payment of such principal, premium, if any, interest, fees and other monies or amounts as may at any time prior to discharge of this Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Article Six be or become owing or payable under or by virtue of or otherwise in connection with the Notes or this Supplemental Indenture. SECTION 8.10. Obligations Reinstated. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would otherwise have reduced the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (whether such payment shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of a Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed from the Trustee or any of the Holders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, all such Indebtedness otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor as provided herein. SECTION 8.11. Obligations Not Affected. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.02 and 8.04, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected, impaired or diminished in any way by any act, omission, matter or thing whatsoever, occurring before, upon or after any demand for payment hereunder (and whether or not known or consented to by any Guarantor or any of the Holders) which, but for this provision, might constitute a whole or partial defense to a claim against any Guarantor hereunder or might operate to release or otherwise exonerate any Guarantor from any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise affect such obligations, whether occasioned by default of any of the Holders or otherwise, including, without limitation: (1) any limitation of status or power, disability, incapacity or other circumstance relating to the Company or any other person, including any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition, dissolution, winding up or other proceeding involving or affecting the Company or any other person; (2) any irregularity, defect, unenforceability or invalidity in respect of any indebtedness or other obligation of the Company or any other person under this Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other document or instrument; 21
(3) any failure of the Company, whether or not without fault on its part, to perform or comply with any of the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes, or to give notice thereof to a Guarantor; (4) the taking or enforcing or exercising or the refusal or neglect to take or enforce or exercise any right or remedy from or against the Company or any other Person or their respective assets or the release or discharge of any such right or remedy; (5) the granting of time, renewals, extensions, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person; (6) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, any of the Notes, or any other amendment, variation, supplement, replacement or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, any of the Notes or this Supplemental Indenture, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease in any amount due with respect to any of the Notes; (7) any change in the ownership, control, name, objects, businesses, assets, capital structure or constitution of the Company or a Guarantor; (8) any merger or amalgamation of the Company or a Guarantor with any Person or Persons; (9) the occurrence of any change in the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances of any jurisdiction by any present or future action of any governmental authority or court amending, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting, or purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of the Obligations or the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee; and (10) any other circumstance (other than by complete, irrevocable payment) that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Company under this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes or of a Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee hereunder. SECTION 8.12. Waiver. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 8.01 hereof, each Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance hereof, notice of any liability of any Guarantor hereunder, notice or proof of reliance by the Holders upon the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, and diligence, presentment, demand for payment on the Company, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any of the Obligations, or other notice or formalities to the Company or any Guarantor of any kind whatsoever. SECTION 8.13. No Obligation to Take Action Against the Company. Neither the Trustee nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies or to take any other steps under any security for the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any Property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee is entitled to demand payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Guarantees or under this Supplemental Indenture. SECTION 8.14. Dealing with the Company and Others. The Holders, without releasing, discharging, limiting or otherwise affecting in whole or in part the obligations and 22
liabilities of any Guarantor hereunder and without the consent of or notice to any Guarantor, may: (1) grant time, renewals, extension, compromises, concessions, waivers, releases, discharges and other indulgences to the Company or any other Person; (2) take or abstain from taking security or collateral from the Company or from perfecting security or collateral of the Company; (3) release, discharge, compromise, realize, enforce or otherwise deal with or do any act or thing in respect of (with or without consideration) any and all collateral, mortgages or other security given by the Company or any third party with respect to the obligations or matters contemplated by this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes; (4) accept compromises or arrangements from the Company; (5) apply all monies at any time received from the Company or from any security upon such part of the Obligations as the Holders may see fit or change any such application in whole or in part from time to time as the Holders may see fit; and (6) otherwise deal with, or waive or modify their right to deal with, the Company and all other Persons and any security as the Holders or the Trustee may see fit. SECTION 8.15. Default and Enforcement. If any Guarantor fails to pay in accordance with Section 8.01 hereof, the Trustee may proceed in its name as trustee hereunder in the enforcement of the Guarantee of any such Guarantor and such Guarantor's obligations thereunder and hereunder by any remedy provided by law, whether by legal proceedings or otherwise, and to recover from such Guarantor the obligations. SECTION 8.16. Amendment, Etc. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Supplemental Indenture relating to any Guarantor or consent to any departure by any Guarantor or any other Person from any such provision will in any event be effective unless it is signed by such Guarantor and the Trustee. SECTION 8.17. Acknowledgment. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges communication of the terms of this Supplemental Indenture and the Notes and consents to and approves of the same. SECTION 8.18. Costs and Expenses. Each Guarantor shall pay on demand by the Trustee any and all costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees on a solicitor and client basis) incurred by the Trustee, its agents, advisors and counsel or any of the Holders in enforcing any of their rights under any Guarantee. SECTION 8.19. No Merger or Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No Guarantee shall operate by way of merger of any of the obligations of a Guarantor under any other agreement, including, without limitation, this Supplemental Indenture. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Holders, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes, shall operate as a waiver thereof; 23
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges in the Guarantee and under this Supplemental Indenture, the Notes and any other document or instrument between a Guarantor and/or the Company and the Trustee are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. SECTION 8.20. Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to the survival of any of the other obligations of each Guarantor hereunder, the obligations of each Guarantor under Section 10.01 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and shall be enforceable against such Guarantor without regard to and without giving effect to any defense, right of offset or counterclaim available to or which may be asserted by the Company or any Guarantor. SECTION 8.21. Guarantee in Addition to Other Obligations. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Supplemental Indenture are in addition to and not in substitution for any other obligations to the Trustee or to any of the Holders in relation to this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes and any guarantees or security at any time held by or for the benefit of any of them. SECTION 8.22. Severability. Any provision of this Article Eight which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate the remaining provisions and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction unless its removal would substantially defeat the basic intent, spirit and purpose of this Supplemental Indenture and this Article Eight. SECTION 8.23. Successors and Assigns. Each Guarantee shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and the Trustee and the other Holders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no Guarantor may assign any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. SECTION 8.24. Acknowledgement under TIA. Each Guarantor acknowledges that, by virtue of its Guarantee, it is becoming an "obligor" on indenture securities under the TIA. ARTICLE NINE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.01. TIA Controls. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by Section 310 through 317 of the TIA, the imposed duties shall control. SECTION 9.02. Conflict with Indenture. To the extent not expressly amended or modified by this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture shall remain in full force and effect. If any provision of this Supplemental Indenture relating to the Notes is inconsistent with any provision of the Indenture, the provision of this Supplemental Indenture shall control with regard to the Notes.

The Company agrees that process in any such action or proceeding may be served upon it by registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules of the court in which the action or proceeding is brought.

Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. 7.

After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or property must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person. 11. AMENDMENT; WAIVER Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, (i) the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults or noncompliance with certain provisions may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to make any change that does not adversely affect the right of any Holder, to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Notes any property or assets, to evidence the succession of another corporation to the company (or successive successions) and the assumption by the successor corporation of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company, to add to the covenants of the Company such further covenants, restrictions or conditions as the Board of Directors and the Trustee shall consider to be for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions or conditions a Default or an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in the Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture, to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes, or to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Supplemental Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary for the Supplemental Indenture to comply with the TIA, or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted. 12. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Under the Supplemental Indenture, Events of Default include (i) a default by the Company in the payment of any interest which continues for more than 30 days after the due date, (ii) a default by the Company in the payment of any principal or Redemption Price due with respect to the Notes; (iii) a default by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with respect to its obligation to pay Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness which is non-recourse to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary), which default shall have resulted in the acceleration of, or be a failure to pay at final maturity, Indebtedness aggregating more than $50 million; (iv) a failure to perform any other covenant or warranty of the Company herein and in A-5
the Indenture, which continues for 30 days after written notice as provided in Section 6.01 of the Indenture; (v) final judgments or orders are rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary which require the payment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of an amount (to the extent not covered by insurance) in excess of $50 million and such judgments or orders remain unstayed or unsatisfied for more than 60 days and are not being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; and (vi) any event described in Sections 6.01(4) or 6.01(5) of the Indenture with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, may declare the outstanding principal of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration on all of the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which shall result in the outstanding principal amount of all Notes being declared due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. Holders may not enforce the Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, conditions and exceptions, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power, including the annulment of a declaration of acceleration. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of amounts specified in clauses (i) and (ii) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. 13. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 14. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS A director, officer, or employee, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Indenture or any stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes. 15. GUARANTEES This Note will be entitled to the benefits of certain Guarantees, if any, made for the benefit of the Holders.

Credit Lyonnais Securities (USA) Inc. UBS Warburg LLC c/o Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 Re: Lennar Corporation Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to Lennar Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale by the Company of $350,000,000 principal amount of its 5.95% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Securities"). This opinion is given pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 31, 2003 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and you. Except as otherwise indicated, terms used in this letter have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary, including executed counterparts of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. We have relied as to matters of fact that we could not confirm independently upon certificates and written statements of public officials and of officers and employees of the Company (including the representations made in the Underwriting Agreement). In examining documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents purporting to be originals, and the conformity to the respective originals of all documents purporting to be copies. Based on the foregoing, and such examination of law as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Company has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus; the Company is duly qualified
to transact business in all jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where we have been advised that the failure to qualify would not have a materially adverse effect upon the business of the Company and the subsidiaries taken as a whole. 2. The Company has authorized and outstanding capital stock as set forth under the caption "Capitalization" in the Final Prospectus; and no preemptive rights of stockholders exist under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or under the DGCL with respect to the capital stock or any other securities of the Company or the issue or sale thereof by the Company 3. Except as described in the Final Prospectus, to the best of our knowledge, no holder of any securities of the Company or any other person has the right, contractual or otherwise, that has not been satisfied or effectively waived, to cause the Company to sell or otherwise issue to them, or to permit them to underwrite the sale of, any of the Securities. 4. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture. 5. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; the Indenture has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee) constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of the Company and each of the Guarantors listed on Exhibit A (the "Designated Guarantors"), enforceable against the Company and each of the Designated Guarantors in accordance with its terms, except that the enforcement thereof is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding to enforce the Indenture may be brought (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 6. The Securities and the Guarantees are in the form contemplated by the Indenture. The Securities have each been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, when paid for by the Underwriter in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee and due authentication and delivery of the Securities by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture), will constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the enforcement thereof is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding to enforce the Securities may be brought (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 7. The Guarantees by the Designated Guarantors will constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Designated Guarantors, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and enforceable against the Designated Guarantors in accordance with their terms, except that the enforcement thereof is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding to enforce the Guarantees may be brought (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 2
8. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Company. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. 9. The Indenture and the Securities conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the descriptions of them contained in the Final Prospectus. 10. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order proceedings with respect thereto have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Act. 11. The Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, each amendment or supplement to either of them and each document incorporated by reference therein complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder (except that we express no opinion as to the financial statements and related schedules incorporated by reference therein). The conditions for the Company's use of Form S-3, set forth in the General Instructions thereto, have been satisfied. 12. The statements under the caption "Description of the Notes" in the Final Prospectus, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of documents referred to therein or matters of law, fairly summarize in all material respects the information called for with respect to such documents and matters. 13. We do not know of any contracts or documents required to be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus that were not so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required, and such contracts and documents as are summarized in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus are fairly summarized in all material respects. 14. We know of no material legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened against the Company, the Designated Guarantors or any other subsidiaries of the Company, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Final Prospectus. 15. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities and the Guarantees and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated do not and will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (or an event that with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default under) or result in the imposition or creation of (or the obligation to impose or create) a lien on any property or assets of the Company with respect to, the charter or bylaws of the Company, or any agreement or instrument known to us to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or any order, rule or regulation known to us to be applicable to the Company of any court or of any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company. 16. No approval, consent, order, authorization, designation, declaration or filing by or with any regulatory, administrative or other governmental body is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities and the Guarantees and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated (other than as may be required by the National 3
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or as required by state securities and Blue Sky laws, as to which we express no opinion), except for the filing and effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and the filing of the Final Prospectus, under the Act and the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, all of which have been made or occurred. 17. The Company is not, and will not become, as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Final Prospectus, required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In addition, we have reviewed the Registration Statement and participated in the preparation of the Final Prospectus (but not necessarily all of the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement) and in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel to the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and your representatives, at which the contents of the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and we have reviewed certain corporate records, documents and proceedings. On the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus, as of its date or the date of this letter, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that we express no belief with respect to the financial statements, related financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference in or excluded from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus). The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of a disclosure document are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendments or supplements to them (including any of the documents incorporated by reference in them), except as set forth in paragraph (12) above. The opinions set forth in this letter relate only to the federal securities laws of the United States of America and the laws of the States of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion as to the laws of another jurisdiction and we assume no responsibility for the applicability or effect of the law of any other jurisdiction. This opinion is based upon the law as in effect and the facts known to us on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to advise you of any subsequent changes in the law or of any facts that hereafter may come to our attention. The phrase "to our knowledge" and similar expressions as used herein refer to the actual knowledge of the individual lawyers in the firm who have participated directly and substantially in the specific transaction to which this opinion relates. This letter is given solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon by any other person for any purpose without our prior written consent in each instance. Very truly yours, /s/ Clifford Chance US LLP 4

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS During fiscal 2002, we acquired nine homebuilding companies for a total of approximately $600 million, including debt of the acquired companies. Among other things, these acquisitions brought us for the first time into the Carolinas and into the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding markets which added to our operations in that state. On January 30, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Seppala Homes, a South Carolina homebuilder. During fiscal 2002, Leonard Miller, one of our founders, passed away. Because of that, voting control of a majority in voting power of our outstanding stock was transferred to Stuart Miller, who since 1997 has been our President and Chief Executive Officer. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilding or similar companies or their assets. We frequently enter into confidentiality agreements before we begin our exploratory evaluations of possible acquisition opportunities. At January 31, 2003, we were a party to confidentiality agreements relating to a number of homebuilding and other companies, including several publicly held companies. Our exploratory evaluations under these or future confidentiality agreements may result in acquisition transactions. However, at the date of this prospectus supplement, we were not engaged in full scale due diligence, and were not discussing transaction terms, regarding any company or companies that would materially affect our balance sheet or our income statement. Our willingness to use Common Stock in acquisitions, or to sell Common Stock, could be adversely affected by the fact that if at any time our Class B Common Stock (which entitles holders to ten votes per share, is essentially non-transferable other than through conversion into Common Stock and is almost entirely owned by entities controlled by Stuart Miller, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and his family) is less than 10% of the outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock taken together, all the Class B Common Stock will automatically be converted into Common Stock. We are considering possible ways of changing our capital structure to facilitate acquisitions and equity offerings, including possible ways to increase the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock we could issue.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) The following table contains summary financial and operating information about us. The financial information at or for the year ended November 30, 2002 has been derived from unaudited financial statements which are in the process of being audited. In the opinion of our management, the unaudited financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the unaudited period. The summary financial and operating information at or for the years ended November 30, 1998 through 2001 has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The historical financial information should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2001 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal 2002, which are incorporated by reference into the prospectus which accompanies this prospectus supplement.

- --------------- (1) Interest incurred excludes all interest on financial services debt. (2) Total capitalization for purposes of this ratio represents homebuilding debt and stockholders' equity. It does not reflect the issuance of the Notes. (3) Total capitalization for purposes of this ratio represents homebuilding net debt and stockholders' equity. It does not reflect the issuance of the Notes. Homebuilding net debt is homebuilding debt net of homebuilding cash. (4) Earnings before deductions for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is provided because it is a measure commonly used to evaluate a company's ability to service its indebtedness. EBITDA is presented to enhance the understanding of our operating results and is not intended to represent cash flows or results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for the periods indicated. EBITDA is not a measurement under GAAP and is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. (5) Consolidated EBITDA includes financial services operating earnings before financial services depreciation and amortization. We do not add back interest expense of our financial services subsidiaries to calculate consolidated EBITDA. (6) Backlog is the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts, some of which are subject to contingencies. Although contracts relating to these homes were executed, there can be no assurance that the sales will be completed. S-6
CAPITALIZATION (In thousands, except per share amounts) The table below shows our capitalization at November 30, 2002 on an unaudited actual basis and as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the Notes: - --------------- (1) Does not include 6,105 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Debentures due 2018, 4,040 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021, or 2,414 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options which were outstanding at November 30, 2002.
