Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "While the geopolitical and economic environment remains uncertain given current events, we are pleased to report yet another record quarter. Our disciplined financial management, guided by the Lennar process, has allowed us to achieve an almost 50% increase in net earnings with a return on net capital in excess of 20%, while still continuing to strengthen our balance sheet."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "Our balance sheet remains strong and our leverage is at an historically low level which positions the Company both for possible adverse market conditions and to capitalize on market inefficiencies and opportunities as they arise."
 
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "Given our current sales pace and record backlog of approximately $3.5 billion and assuming general economic stability, we are well positioned to achieve our stated goals of $8.50 per share in fiscal 2003 and $10.00 per share in fiscal 2004, which is based on 76 million diluted shares in both years assuming dilution for both of the Company's convertible debt securities."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from sales of homes increased 30% in the first quarter of 2003 to $1.4 billion from $1.1 billion in 2002. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 18% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 10% increase in the average sales price. New home deliveries increased to 5,642 homes in the first quarter of 2003 from 4,791 homes last year. New home deliveries were higher primarily due to strength in the California market, combined with the Company's entry into the Illinois market in the second half of 2002. The average sales price on homes delivered increased to $255,000 in the first quarter of 2003 from $232,000 in 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of the Company's markets, combined with changes in product mix.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $342.9 million, or 23.8%, in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $256.4 million, or 23.1%, in 2002. Margins were positively impacted by strength in most of the Company's markets, offset by softness in the Texas market.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 12.1% in both the first quarter of 2003 and 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues from home sales given the higher revenues in selected markets including primarily California, Maryland and Virginia. This decrease was offset by higher marketing costs in other markets, including primarily Texas and Colorado.
 
Sales of land and other revenues, net, totaled $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $4.7 million in the same period in 2002. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $6.2 million in the same period last year. Margins achieved on land sales and equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales by the Company and unconsolidated partnerships in which it has investments.
 
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division increased to $34.3 million in the first quarter of 2003 from $23.4 million last year. The increase was primarily due to improved results from the Company's mortgage and title operations which benefited from a continued low interest rate and strong housing environment in the first quarter of 2003. Mortgage and title results reflected increases both in the number of transactions and in the profit per transaction in the first quarter of 2003, compared to 2002.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in both the first quarter of 2003 and 2002.
 
Interest Expense
 
In the first quarter of 2003, interest expense was $30.2 million, or 1.9% of total revenues, compared to $24.0 million, or 1.9% of total revenues, in 2002.
