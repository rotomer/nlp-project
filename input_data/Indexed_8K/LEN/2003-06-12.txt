MIAMI, June 10, 2003Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
 
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The U.S. homebuilding market remains very strong as a result of favorable supply and demand trends. Demand remains high due to historically low interest rates, healthy demographic driven demand and improving consumer sentiment. The homebuilding industry's supply of new homes remains historically low due to a continued constrained supply of developable land. Our economic environment has been reinforced with the continuation of a nesting trend in which consumers are traveling less and are willing to invest more and spend more time in their homes."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "During the past 18 months we have acquired 11 new homebuilding franchises which have been integrated into the Lennar Family of Builders operations and are enhancing our bottom line performance. Our record earnings are reflective of the success and rapid integration of these acquisitions combined with our strong organic growth program. Based on continuing favorable market conditions and trends, our successful Lennar Process and our record backlog, we are positioned to continue gaining market share and to achieve our increased earnings goals of $8.50 per share in 2003 and $9.50 per share in 2004."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from sales of homes increased 36% in the second quarter of 2003 to $1.9 billion from $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 25% increase in the number of home deliveries and an 8% increase in the average sales price. New home deliveries increased to 7,385 homes in the second quarter of 2003 from 5,899 homes in the same period last year. New home deliveries were higher primarily due to continued growth in the California market, combined with the Company's entry into the Illinois market in the second half of 2002. The average sales price on homes delivered increased to $257,000 in the second quarter of 2003 from $237,000 in 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in some of the Company's markets, combined with changes in product and geographic mix.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $464.9 million, or 24.5%, in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $335.5 million, or 24.0%, in 2002. Margins were positively impacted by strength in many of the Company's markets, with particular strength in California partially offset by softness in the Texas market.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.3% in both the second quarter of 2003 and 2002.
 
Sales of land and other revenues, net, totaled $19.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $9.2 million in the same period in 2002. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $6.7 million in the same period last year. Margins achieved on land sales and equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales by the Company and unconsolidated partnerships in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division increased to $37.2 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $26.7 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a higher number of transactions in the Company's mortgage and title operations, which benefited from record low interest rates and a strong housing environment in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved to 1.2% in the second quarter of 2003 from 1.3% in the same period last year.
 
Interest Expense
 
In the second quarter of 2003, interest expense was $36.3 million, or 1.7% of total revenues, compared to $30.5 million, or 1.9% of total revenues, in 2002. The decrease is primarily due to a lower debt leverage ratio while the Company continues to grow.
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from sales of homes increased 33% in the six months ended May 31, 2003 to $3.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the same period last year. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 22% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 9% increase in the average sales price. New home deliveries increased to 13,027 homes in the six months ended May 31, 2003 from 10,690 homes in the same period last year. New home deliveries were higher primarily due to continued growth in the California market, combined with the Company's entry into the Illinois market in the second half of 2002. The average sales price on homes delivered increased to $256,000 in the six months ended May 31, 2003 from $235,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in some of the Company's markets, combined with changes in product and geographic mix.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $807.8 million, or 24.2%, in the six months ended May 31, 2003, compared to $591.9 million, or 23.6%, in 2002. Margins were positively impacted by strength, primarily in the west region, partially offset by softness in the Texas market.
