The preliminary proxy statement contains a detailed description of the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger that was signed on July 21, 2003 by Newhall Land, Lennar and LNR, as well as other information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about required regulatory approvals. The preliminary proxy statement is available, without charge, on the SEC's web site, http://www.sec.gov, under Newhall Land's filings. Neither Lennar nor LNR will be filing proxy statements relating to the Newhall Land transaction, as their stockholders are not required to vote with regard to it.

However, holders of approximately 10% of Newhall Land's units have agreed to vote for the transaction and have given the Lennar/LNR joint venture proxies to facilitate that vote. (more)

The definitive proxy statement will also be available, without charge, on the SEC's web site. Newhall Land's unitholders will be urged to read the definitive proxy statement when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.
