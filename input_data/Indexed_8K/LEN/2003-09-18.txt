Third quarter net earnings in 2003 were $201.6 million, or $2.43 per share diluted, compared to net earnings of $142.2 million, or $1.83 per share diluted, in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings per share amounts and average shares outstanding for 2003 and 2002 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Company's April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution. Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Our record results for the third quarter are attributable to continued strength in the homebuilding market and our disciplined approach to managing our business, which we call "The Lennar Process". This process allows us to generate sustainable strong returns on capital and equity while remaining focused on protecting our conservative balance sheet."
Mr. Miller continued, "We have continued to expand our proven and very successful dual marketing strategy into each of our markets, which has enabled us to increase market share. We have also continued to improve our already strong gross margins by creating programs to reduce construction costs while improving quality." Mr. Miller concluded, "Based on our record performance and strong backlog entering the fourth quarter, we are comfortable increasing our EPS goal for fiscal 2003 to $8.90 from $8.50 per share. Additionally, even with the recent rise in interest rates and lumber prices, as well as a slower refinance market, we remain well positioned to deliver 37,000 homes and achieve our stated goal of $9.50 per share in fiscal 2004." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2003 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2002 HOMEBUILDING Revenues from sales of homes increased 21% in the third quarter of 2003 to $2.0 billion from $1.7 billion in the same period last year. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 13% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 6% increase in the average sales price. New home deliveries increased to 7,929 homes in the third quarter of 2003 from 6,993 homes in the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2003, new home deliveries were higher in most of the Company's markets, primarily in California and Illinois, compared to 2002. The average sales price on homes delivered increased to $257,000 in the third quarter of 2003 from $242,000 in 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in some of the Company's markets, combined with changes in product and geographic mix. Gross profits on home sales increased to $483.9 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $377.8 million in 2002. Gross margin percentages on home sales were 23.7% (25.3% excluding interest) in 2003, compared to 22.3% (24.5% excluding interest) in 2002. Margins were positively impacted by a greater contribution from a strong California market, combined with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while the Company continues to grow. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.8% in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 10.6% in the same period in 2002. Gross profits on land sales totaled $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $8.2 million in the same period in 2002. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $25.1 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $4.2 million in the same period last year. Management fees and other income, net totaled $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $7.1 million in the same period in 2002. Land sales, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions by the Company and unconsolidated partnerships in which it has investments.
In the three months ended August 31, 2003, homebuilding results reflect reclassifications within the statement of earnings that have been made to interest expense (included in cost of sales), equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on reported net earnings. FINANCIAL SERVICES Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division increased to $49.3 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $30.1 million in the same period last year. The significant increase in the Division's mortgage and title operating earnings was primarily due to an extremely strong refinance environment in the third quarter of 2003, compared to 2002. CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in the third quarter of 2003, compared to 1.1% in the same period last year. NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2003 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2002 HOMEBUILDING Revenues from sales of homes increased 28% in the nine months ended August 31, 2003 to $5.4 billion from $4.2 billion in the same period last year.

New home deliveries increased to 20,956 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2003 from 17,683 homes in the same period last year.

Gross margin percentages on home sales were 22.8% (24.6% excluding interest) in 2003, compared to 21.8% (24.0% excluding interest) in 2002.
