The information in this Current Report, including the exhibit to it, is being furnished and should not be deemed "filed" for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subjected to the liabilities of that Section. This Current Report will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference in a registration statement or other filing.
 
On December 15, 2003, Lennar Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release containing information about its results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended November 30, 2003. A copy of this press release is included as an exhibit to this Report.
 
Our press release included our earnings before interest and provision for income taxes ("EBIT") for the quarter and year ended November 30, 2003, as well as a table reconciling the computation of EBIT to our earnings for those periods. EBIT is not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nonetheless, our management uses EBIT because it helps them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors, by eliminating factors that differ from company to company for reasons that often are not related to the effectiveness of the companies' operations. Our management believes EBIT provides useful information to investors and analysts because it will help them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Our diversified growth strategy of expanding both organically and through strategic acquisitions has propelled us to another record year of revenues and earnings in our homebuilding, land and financial services operations in 2003. Continuing supply constraints and strong demographic trends, together with low interest rates and improving economic trends, continue to position the homebuilding industry for future growth."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "Our current strategic positions in all of our markets give us excellent visibility into 2004. With volume and communities in place, we are strategically focused on improving margins through various initiatives on cutting costs, while we continue to improve the quality of our homes."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "As a result of the confidence we have in our company, our record backlog entering 2004 and our strong balance sheet, we are increasing our EPS goal for fiscal 2004 to $10.50 from $9.50 per share and establishing a fiscal 2005 goal of $12.00 per share."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from sales of homes increased 12% in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $2.7 billion from $2.4 billion in the same period last year. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 14% increase in the number of home deliveries offset by a 2% decrease in the average sales price. New home deliveries increased to 10,456 homes in the fourth quarter of 2003 from 9,142 homes in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of 2003, new home deliveries were higher in most of the Company's markets, primarily in Florida and Texas, compared to 2002. The average sales price on homes delivered decreased to $255,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003 from $261,000 in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to changes in product and geographic mix. The largest impact on average sales price was in California as the Company focused its growth on the Inland Empire and Central Valley markets which have lower average sales prices, compared to the coastal California markets.
 
Gross profits on home sales increased to $631.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $545.3 million in 2002. Gross margin percentages on home sales were 23.7% in 2003, compared to 22.9% in 2002. Margins were positively impacted by a greater improvement from each of the Company's regions, combined with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while the Company continues to grow.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to 9.8% in 2002.

Gross profits on land sales totaled $48.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to ($0.1) million in the same period in 2002. Profits were positively impacted by each of the Company's regions, with strong contributions from the Company's East and West regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $25.6 million in the same period last year. Management fees and other income, net totaled $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $7.9 million in the same period in 2002. Land sales, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions by the Company and unconsolidated partnerships in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division decreased to $33.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 from $47.4 million in the same period last year. The decline in operating earnings in 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in refinance transactions, which resulted in reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations, compared to the same period in 2002. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2002, Strategic Technologies, Inc. generated a $5.0 million gain on the sale of a cable system.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in both the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002.
 
Other Information
 
Earnings per share amounts and average shares outstanding for 2003 and 2002 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Company's April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution. Additionally, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 included 4.5 million shares related to the Company's 5.125% contingent convertible debt securities. These shares were not included in diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2002 because the contingencies were not met.
