Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January 27, 2004, NWHL Investment LLC ("NWHL"), which is 50% owned by Lennar Corporation and 50% owned by LNR Property Corporation, acquired The Newhall Land and Farming Company ("Newhall Land") by merging a wholly owned subsidiary of NWHL into Newhall Land in a transaction in which NWHL and a wholly owned subsidiary became the sole members of Newhall Land and Newhall Land unitholders received, for each Newhall Land unit they owned, $40.50 per unit in cash. The payments to Newhall Land unitholders (including payments for options that had not yet been exercised) totaled approximately $1 billion.
At the same time that NWHL acquired Newhall Land, the venture sold a group of income producing properties to LNR for approximately $217 million and Lennar agreed to purchase 687 homesites, and obtained options to purchase 623 homesites, from the venture.

EXECUTION COPY
     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 21, 2003 (this "Agreement"), by and among The Newhall Land and Farming Company, a California limited partnership (the "Company"), Lennar Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and LNR Property Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, "Lima"), NWHL Investment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, a directly or indirectly owned subsidiary of Lima ("Parent"), and NWHL Acquisition, L.P., a California limited partnership ("Acquisition").
     The board of directors, board of managers, general partner or general partners, as the case may be, of each of Lima, Parent, Acquisition and the Company have approved, and deem it fair, advisable and in the best interests of each respective corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership and its shareholders, members or limited partners, as the case may be, to consummate the acquisition of the Company by Parent through the merger of Acquisition with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Merger").
     The respective general partner or general partners of each of Acquisition and the Company have unanimously approved the Merger and the principal terms of this Agreement in accordance with the California Revised Limited Partnership Act (the "RLPA") and the respective board of directors or members of each of Lima and Parent have approved the Merger and the Agreement.
     The general partners of the Company have determined that this Agreement is advisable, and that the consideration to be paid for each Unit (as defined in Section 1.7) in the Merger is fair to the holders of such Units, and have resolved to recommend that the holders of such Units approve the principal terms of the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
     As a condition and inducement to each party's entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, (i) certain unitholders of the Company, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, are entering into a voting agreement, substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement"), and (ii) Parent is delivering to the Company cash in the amount of $5.0 million.
     In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
 
     1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the RLPA, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3), Acquisition will be merged with and into the Company, which will be the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the "Surviving Partnership"). Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, when the Merger becomes effective, (a) the real and personal property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of the Company will continue as those of the Surviving Partnership, unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger, (b) the separate existence of Acquisition will terminate, and Acquisition's real and personal property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises will be merged into the Surviving Partnership, which will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Acquisition in accordance with the RLPA, and (c) the Merger will have the other effects specified in the RLPA (including Section 15678.6 of the RLPA).
     1.2 Certificate of Limited Partnership. The certificate of limited partnership of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be amended in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of limited partnership of Acquisition immediately before the Effective Time and shall be the certificate of limited partnership of Surviving Partnership from the Effective Time until subsequently amended in accordance with applicable law. The certificate of limited partnership of Company, as so amended, separate and apart from this Agreement, may be certified as the certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving Partnership.
     1.3 Limited Partnership Agreement. The limited partnership agreement of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be amended in its entirety to be identical to the limited partnership agreement of Acquisition immediately before the Effective Time and shall be the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership from the Effective Time until it is amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law.
     1.4 General Partner. NWHL GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition General Partner"), as the sole general partner of Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the sole general partner of the Surviving Partnership after the Effective Time and will serve in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership until its withdrawal or removal in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership.
     1.5 Limited Partner. Parent, the sole limited partner of Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the sole limited partner of the Surviving Partnership after the Effective Time.
     1.6 Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Partnership determines or is advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Partnership its right, obligation, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either the Company or Acquisition acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Partnership as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
 
carry out the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement, the general partner of the Surviving Partnership will be authorized to execute and deliver all documents, in the name and behalf of the Company, Acquisition or otherwise, and to take all other actions and do all other things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, obligation, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Partnership or otherwise to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
     1.7 Units of Interest in the Company.
          (a) At the Effective Time, each depositary unit of limited partnership interest in the Company (each, a "Unit"), including Units owned by the General Partners (as defined in Section 3.1), which is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into and become the right to receive (i) $40.50 in cash, without interest, plus (ii) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) $40.50, multiplied by (B) 5% multiplied by (C) the fraction obtained by dividing (1) the total number of days elapsed between (x) the date that is 270 days after the date that a public announcement is first jointly made by the parties with respect to the proposed Merger and (y) the Merger Date, by (2) 365, (the sum of (i) and (ii) above, net of and reduced by applicable Tax (as defined in Section 3.10) withholding, being referred to as the "Merger Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, a depositary receipt which represented a Unit will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
          (b) At the Effective Time, each general partnership interest in the Company which is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into and become the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, any certificate which represented any general partnership interest in the Company will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties acknowledge that each general partnership interest in the Company is represented by a unit (a "GP Unit") which represents the same economic interest in the Company as a Unit; accordingly, for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration, each GP Unit shall be considered to be a Unit.
          (c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the holders of Units listed in Section 1.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Article 3), who hold in the aggregate 12.13% of the Units outstanding on the date of this Agreement, delivered Voting Agreements to Parent.
     1.8 Units of Interest in Acquisition. At the Effective Time, each unit of limited partnership interest in Acquisition (each, an "Acquisition Unit") which is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will remain outstanding and will become one limited partnership unit of the Surviving Partnership.
     1.9 Deposit. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Lima is delivering to the Company cash in the amount of $5.0 million (the "Initial Deposit Amount"). In the event this Agreement has not been terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or otherwise terminated pursuant to Article VII prior to the Due Diligence Termination Date (as defined in Section 3.3), (i) Lima, Parent, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") shall, on or prior to the Due Diligence Termination Date, execute an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, subject to any changes that may be
 
required by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"), and (ii) Lima shall (or shall cause Parent to), on the first business day after the Due Diligence Termination Date, deliver to the Escrow Agent cash in the amount of $25.0 million (the "Additional Deposit Amount") to be held by the Escrow Agent in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event that this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Article VII on or prior to the date of the Company Meeting (as defined in Section 5.5) and the principal terms of the Merger are approved by the holders of the majority of the Units entitled to vote on the matter at the Company Meeting, Lima shall (or shall cause Parent to), on the first business day after the Company Meeting, cause the Escrow Agent to deliver the Additional Deposit Amount to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Initial Deposit Amount and all amounts held in escrow at any time (including the Additional Deposit Amount together with interest earned thereon while held by the Escrow Agent) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Escrow Fund").
     1.10 Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Units or GP Units are changed into a different number of Units or GP Units by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, split up, combination or exchange of Units or GP Units that has a record date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted to provide the holders of the Units (the "Unitholders") and the holders of the GP Units ("GP Holders") the same economic effect as that contemplated by this Agreement if the reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, or exchange had not taken place.
     1.11 Distributions with Regard to Company Interests.
          (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will jointly designate a bank or trust company to act as distributing agent in connection with the Merger (the "Distributing Agent"). Immediately before the Effective Time, (i) the Company will wire transfer the Escrow Fund (excluding interest) to the Distributing Agent and (ii) Lima will (or will cause Parent to) provide the Distributing Agent with the balance of the Merger Consideration, after taking into account the Escrow Fund, which will have to be distributed to Unitholders and GP Holders under Section 1.11(c).
          (b) While the Distributing Agent is holding funds provided by Lima or Parent under Section 1.11(a), the Distributing Agent will invest the funds, as directed by Parent, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services Inc. or Standard & Poors' Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million (based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available at the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or otherwise); that any losses on such investment will not reduce any Unitholder's right or GP Holder's right to Merger Consideration.
provided
 
          (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Lima or Parent will cause the Distributing Agent to mail to each person who was a Unitholder of record or GP Holder of record at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal (in a form which will have been approved by counsel to the Company prior to the Effective Time, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) for use in effecting the surrender of depositary receipts representing Units or certificates representing GP Units (such depository receipts and certificates being referred to herein as "Certificates"), in order to receive payment of the Merger Consideration. When the Distributing Agent receives a Certificate, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, the Distributing Agent will distribute to the holder of the Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to the Units or GP Units represented by the Certificate, and the Certificate will be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, the surrendered Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person who surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the distribution to a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Partnership that the tax has been paid. After the Effective Time, a Certificate which has not been surrendered will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest.
          (d) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Lima or Parent will accept (and will cause the Distributing Agent to accept) an affidavit and indemnification or bond reasonably satisfactory to it instead of the Certificate and will cause the Merger Consideration to be paid the holder of the Units or GP Units which had been represented by the Certificate.
          (e) At any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time, Lima or Parent may require the Distributing Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Distributing Agent and have not been disbursed to former holders of Units or GP Units (including, without limitation, interest and other income received by the Distributing Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered to Lima or Parent, former holders of Units or GP Units must look to Lima or Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them. None of Lima, Parent, the Surviving Partnership or the Distributing Agent will be liable to any former holders of Units or GP Units for any Merger Consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
          (f) At the close of business on the day during which the Effective Time occurs, the Company will not record any transfers of Units or GP Units on the books of the Company, and the depositary of the Company will be closed. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented for transfer (together with a properly completed letter of transmittal as contemplated by Section 1.11(c)), they will be canceled and treated as having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration described in Section 1.7(a).
     1.12 Determinations Regarding Documents. The Surviving Partnership will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part, to determine whether letters of transmittal accompanying Certificates have been properly and timely completed, signed and submitted and
 
to determine whether or not to disregard immaterial defects in particular letters of transmittal. The decision of the Surviving Partnership with regard to those matters will be conclusive and binding. None of Lima, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Distributing Agent will have any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a letter of transmittal submitted to the Surviving Partnership or the Distributing Agent, as applicable.
     1.13 Equity Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option, appreciation right, restricted Unit or Unit right issued by the Company which is outstanding at the Effective Time (collectively, the "Awards") and not then otherwise fully vested will be deemed fully vested pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan or instrument for the total number of Units purchasable or issuable thereunder. All vested Awards will be cancelled in connection with the Merger. As of the Effective Time, each cancelled Award will represent the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Units subject to the Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, reduced by the aggregate unpaid exercise or purchase price or other consideration payable for the Units issued under such Award. To receive the amount to which a holder of an Award is entitled under this Section 1.13, the holder must deliver to the Surviving Partnership (a) any certificate or agreement relating to the Award and (b) a document in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent in which the holder acknowledges that the payment the holder is receiving is in full satisfaction of any rights the holder may have under or with regard to the Award. Lima will (or will cause Parent or the Surviving Partnership to) pay the amount due (less the applicable exercise price of such Award) under this Section 1.13 to a holder of an Award promptly after the Surviving Partnership receives from the holder the items described in clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding sentence.
     1.14 Withholding. Parent may withhold from the Merger Consideration payable to any Unitholder or GP Holder or consideration payable to any holder of an Award pursuant to Section 1.13 and pay to the appropriate taxing authorities, any amounts which Parent may be required (or may reasonably believe it is required) to withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration or consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.13 which is withheld as permitted by this Section 1.14 will be deemed to have been paid to the Unitholder, GP Holder, or holder of an Award with respect to whom it is withheld. Parent acknowledges that because the Units represent interests in a publicly traded partnership that are regularly traded on an established securities market, no withholding will be required or undertaken by Parent under Section 1445(a) of the Code.
     2.1 Date of the Merger. Unless this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Article 7, the day on which the Merger is to take place (the "Merger Date") shall be within seven business days after the day on which all the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than conditions which are contemplated to be satisfied on or after the Merger Date) have been satisfied or waived. The Merger Date may be changed with the consent of the Company and Parent.
 
     2.2 Execution of Certificate of Merger. On or prior to the Merger Date, Acquisition and the Company will each execute a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") along with appropriate officers' certificates as required by applicable law, each of which will be in proper form for filing under the RLPA, and deliver it to Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP for filing with the Secretary of State of California after all of the conditions in Article 6 have been satisfied or waived. When all the conditions in Article 6 have been satisfied or waived, Parent and the Company will (a) cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California on the Merger Date and (b) cause all other documents which must be recorded or filed as a result of the Merger to be recorded or filed.
     2.3 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger will become effective at the date and time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California, or at such other time and date as are agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (that being the "Effective Time").
     Except as set forth in a disclosure letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), delivered to Parent as provided in Section 5.9 hereof, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition as follows:
     3.1 Organization and Authorization, Validity of Agreement, Company Action. The Company is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company has all partnership power and authority necessary to enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All limited partnership actions necessary to authorize the Company to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by it, other than approval of the principal terms of the Merger by a majority of the Unitholders entitled to vote on the matter, have been taken. This Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Acquisition, Parent and Lima, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. Each of Newhall Management Limited Partnership, a California limited partnership, which is the Company's managing general partner (the "Managing General Partner"), Newhall General Partnership, a California general partnership, which is the Company's only other general partner (together with the Managing General Partner, the "General Partners") and Newhall Management Corporation, a California corporation, which is the managing general partner of the Managing General Partner, and its board of directors, have, in accordance with their respective organizational and constituent documents, approved the Merger and this Agreement and have voted to recommend to the Unitholders that they approve the principal terms of the Merger.
     3.2 No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or of any document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will (a) violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, the certificate of
 
limited partnership or the limited partnership agreement of the Company (the "Governing Documents") or any of the constituent documents of either of the General Partners or (b) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach (with or without the passage of time or the giving of any notice) in any material respect of any provision of, or give any person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy or right of termination under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any loan or other evidence of indebtedness or mortgage or any other material contract or document to which the Company is a party or any of its assets or property is bound or subject, except as provided in Section 1.13 hereof and except as shown in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter.
     3.3 No Violations. Except as shown in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, or consents, or other governmental action, other than the expiration or termination of waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement for mailing, and the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission ("Utilities Commission") under the California Public Utilities Act (the "PUA"), are required to permit the Company to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement and consummate the Merger, other than governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, consents or other governmental actions the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect on the Company" means (i) aggregate losses, liabilities and/or expenses to the Company and its subsidiaries that exceed, or would reasonably be expected to exceed, $50.0 million or (ii) events, facts, circumstances and/or conditions that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Company from consummating the Merger, but (a) no individual loss, liability or expense of $1.0 million or less will be counted in determining losses, liabilities or expenses which are aggregated towards such $50.0 million threshold, although a series of directly related losses, liabilities or expenses will be aggregated together to determine whether the $1.0 million threshold has been met; (b) no losses, liabilities or expenses related to, arising out of or otherwise by virtue of the Newhall Ranch Entitlement (as defined in Section 5.2(b)) will be aggregated toward such $50.0 million threshold; (c) no losses, liabilities or expenses related to, arising out of or otherwise by virtue of (i) changes in general economic conditions (including, without limitation, changes in interest rates), (ii) changes or occurrences affecting the homebuilding industry generally or (iii) changes in laws, rules, orders or regulations of governmental entities, will be aggregated toward such $50.0 million threshold; (d) no losses, liabilities or expenses required by a change in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") will be aggregated toward such $50.0 million threshold; and (e) no losses, liabilities or expenses arising out of, related to, or otherwise by virtue of facts, circumstances or conditions that existed on or before September 4, 2003 (the "Due Diligence Termination Date") and which either (i) the Company disclosed in writing to Parent and/or Lima at least three (3) business days prior to the Due Diligence Termination Date or (ii) Parent or Lima has independently obtained actual and current knowledge as of the Due Diligence Termination Date will be aggregated toward such $50.0 million threshold. Except as shown in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any other person is or will be required to give any notice to or obtain any consent or approval from any person in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation or performance of the transaction contemplated hereby or any change in control of the Company. In that regard, except as specifically shown in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as a result of the change in control of the Company, no
 
indebtedness or other material obligations or material contracts of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates will be accelerated, become due or terminate.
     3.4 Qualification. Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of all of the Company's subsidiaries, the states of organization or formation and the percentage ownership by the Company of such subsidiaries and a true and complete list of all other equity interests, options, warrants or other rights exercisable into or debt or equity convertible or exchangeable into equity interests of any other person or entity owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company and each of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign partnership or other business entity in each state in which it is required to be qualified, except states in which the failure to qualify, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
     3.5 Capitalization. On July 18, 2003, there were 36,483,333 Units outstanding (including 187,000 outstanding restricted Units shown in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter and 13,252,347 Units held in treasury) and 288,810 GP Units outstanding. All the outstanding Units and GP Units have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and issued in accordance with the Company's limited partnership agreement. Except as shown in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire Units or GP Units or any other equity securities or any appreciation rights, and is not a party to any other agreements, which require, or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any other event may require, the Company to issue or sell any Units or GP Units or any other equity securities. Except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no restricted Units outstanding. The number of Units which the Company repurchased between January 1, 2003 and the date of this Agreement did not exceed 1,289,265 Units and the total amount the Company paid for those Units did not exceed $37,779,695.
     3.6 Subsidiaries. Except as shown in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) each of the corporations and other entities of which the Company owns directly or indirectly 51% or more of the equity (each corporation or other entity of which a company owns directly or indirectly 51% or more of the equity being a "subsidiary" of that company) has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation or organization, (b) all the shares of stock or interests owned by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and, in the case of stock, non-assessable and are not subject to any preemptive rights, and (c) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has issued any options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities or any other rights to acquire any equity securities or any appreciation rights, or is a party to any other agreements, which require, or upon the passage of time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any other event may require, the Company or any subsidiary to issue or sell any stock or other equity interests in any of the Company's subsidiaries and, there are no registration covenants or transfer or voting restrictions or other shareholder agreements or arrangements with respect to outstanding securities of any of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
     3.7 Reports and Financial Statements.
          (a) Since January 1, 2002, the Company has filed with the SEC all forms, statements, reports and documents it has been required to file under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or the rules promulgated under them.
          (b) The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (the "2002 10-K") and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2003 (the "March 10-Q") which the Company filed with the SEC, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, each contained, all the information required to be included in it and, when it was filed, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, the financial statements included in the 2002 10-K all were prepared, and the financial information included in the March 10-Q was derived from financial statements which were prepared, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except that financial information included in the March 10-Q does not contain notes and is subject to normal year-end adjustments) and present fairly the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries at the dates, and for the periods, to which they relate.
     3.8 Assets. The assets of the Company and its subsidiaries constitute, in the aggregate, all the assets (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights) used in or necessary to the conduct of their businesses as they currently are being conducted.
     3.9 Compliance with Law; Permits.
          (a) The Company and its subsidiaries have at all times complied, and currently are complying, with all applicable Federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, except failures to comply which would not reasonably be expected, in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
          (b) Except as shown in Section 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and its subsidiaries have all licenses and permits which are required at the date of this Agreement to enable them to conduct their businesses as they currently are being conducted, except licenses or permits the lack of which would not reasonably be expected, in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
     3.10 Tax Matters. The Company and each of its subsidiaries has filed when due (taking account of extensions) all Tax Returns (as defined below) relating to Federal income taxes, and all other material Tax Returns, which it has been required to file and has paid all Taxes shown on those returns to be due. Those Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects and accurately reflect the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and Taxes required to have been reported or paid, except to the extent of items which may be disputed by applicable taxing authorities but for which there is substantial authority to support the position taken by the Company or the subsidiary and which have been adequately reserved against in

          (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c), then the Company shall retain the Initial Deposit Amount (along with any interest accrued thereon).

          (f) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e), then the Company (i) will retain the Initial Deposit Amount (along with any interest accrued thereon) and (ii) return to Parent (without any interest earned after it was released to the Company), or instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent (with interest), the Additional Deposit Amount.
          (g) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(f), the Company will return and/or cause the Escrow Agent to return to Parent the Escrow Fund (without any interest earned after it was released to the Company).
          (h) If all conditions in Section 6.2 and all conditions in Section 6.3 have been satisfied prior to the Merger Date, and within seven business days thereof the Merger is not
 
consummated due to any action or inaction by Lima, Parent or Acquisition, then, and without limiting Company's rights under Article 7, the other provisions of this Section 8.1 or under Section 9.10, the Company will retain the entire Escrow Fund that has been released to it and, to the extent that the Escrow Agent then holds any of the Escrow Fund, the Parent will instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Company any of the Escrow Fund then being held by it.

The Surviving Partnership will pay all reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations of the Surviving Partnership under this Section 9.3.
          (b) Lima and Parent will cause the Surviving Partnership to keep in effect (at no less than their current levels of coverage) for at least six years after the Effective Time the policies or tail liability coverage of (i) general partners' liability insurance maintained by the General Partners and/or Company and (ii) either directors and officers' liability insurance, general partner's liability insurance or managing member liability insurance, as the case may be, maintained by the General Partners, the Company, their respective subsidiaries at the date of this
