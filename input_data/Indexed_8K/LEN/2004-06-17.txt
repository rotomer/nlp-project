On June 15, 2004, Lennar Corporation issued a press release containing information about its results of operations for the three and six months ended May 31, 2004. A copy of this press release is included as an exhibit to this Report.
 
Our press release included our earnings before interest and provision for income taxes ("EBIT") for the three and six months ended May 31, 2004, as well as a table reconciling the computation of EBIT to our earnings for those periods. EBIT is not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nonetheless, our management uses EBIT because it helps them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors, by eliminating factors that differ from company to company for reasons that often are not related to the efficiency and effectiveness of the companies' operations. Our management believes EBIT provides useful information to investors and analysts, because it will help them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are very pleased to report record results again for our second quarter with net earnings growth of 26%, an increase in revenues of 11% and backlog dollar value up 39% over the prior year. These strong results were attributable to both improving homebuilding gross margins and strong land sales, which counterbalanced lower financial services results that were impacted by higher interest rates and the resulting national pullback in refinance activity. By paring down our land base in the wake of the Newhall acquisition last quarter, we have continued to position our balance sheet and our company for future growth and participation in consolidation activity in the industry."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "New home sales activity continued to point to a strong homebuilding market as we saw our sales pace increase 17% year-over-year for the quarter. In today's environment, we, along with the other large homebuilders, are continuing to leverage size to offset the impact of higher interest rates, higher building costs and a shortage of certain building materials. As the industry continues to consolidate, the largest homebuilders are positioned to best manage these challenges through process improvement and cost reduction and, therefore, should continue to outperform. Lennar is strategically positioned with a strong balance sheet and strategic approach to capitalizing on both organic and acquisitive growth opportunities."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "Our record-level $5.9 billion backlog gives us excellent visibility for the remainder of fiscal 2004 and we are comfortable increasing our 2004 earnings per share goal to $5.50 from $5.30 per share. Given our strong balance sheet, consistent cash flows and disciplined land strategy, we remain well positioned for future growth."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 9% in the second quarter of 2004 to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher due primarily to a 5% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 4% increase in average sales price on homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 7,765 homes in the second quarter of 2004 from 7,385 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2003. The average sales price on homes delivered increased to $266,000 in the second quarter of 2004 from $257,000 in 2003.

Gross margins on home sales were $483.7 million, or 23.4%, in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $430.3 million, or 22.7%, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by an improvement in the Company's East and Central Regions, combined with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while the Company continued to grow.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 12.1% in the second quarter of 2004, compared to 11.3% in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses resulting from increased land sales, compared to the same period last year.
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $147.0 million and $56.5 million, or 38.5%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $72.0 million and $13.0 million, or 18.0%, respectively, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by each of the Company's regions, with a strong contribution from the Company's East Region. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $14.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $11.3 million last year. Management fees and other income, net totaled $18.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $5.3 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated partnerships in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $32.3 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $37.2 million last year. The decline in operating earnings in 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in refinance transactions and a more competitive mortgage environment, which resulted in reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations, compared to 2003. The decline in operating earnings was partially offset by a $6.5 million gain generated from monetizing the majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in the second quarter of 2004, compared to 1.2% last year.
 
Other Information
 
Earnings per share amounts and average shares outstanding for 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Company's January 2004 two-for-one stock split. Additionally, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2004 included 9.0 million shares related to the Company's 5.125% contingent convertible debt securities. These shares were not included in diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2003, because the contingencies were not met.
