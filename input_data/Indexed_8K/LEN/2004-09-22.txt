Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On September 20, 2004, Lennar Corporation issued a press release containing information about its results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2004. A copy of this press release is included as an exhibit to this Report.
 
Our press release included our earnings before interest and provision for income taxes ("EBIT") for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2004, as well as a table reconciling the computation of EBIT to our earnings for those periods. EBIT is not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nonetheless, our management uses EBIT because it helps them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors, by eliminating factors that differ from company to company for reasons that often are not related to the efficiency and effectiveness of the companies' operations. Our management believes EBIT provides useful information to investors and analysts, because it will help them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations with those of our competitors.

2004 / 2005 Goals
 
 
 
, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported earnings for its third quarter ended August 31, 2004. Third quarter net earnings in 2004 were $225.2 million, or $1.36 per share diluted, compared to net earnings of $201.6 million, or $1.21 per share diluted, in 2003.
Miami, September 20, 2004  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
 
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report record results again for our third quarter with net earnings growth of 12% and an increase in revenues of 21% over the prior year. Additionally, our new orders increased 1% for the quarter and resulted in a 17% year-over-year increase in homes in backlog. These record results were achieved despite hurricane activity in several of our markets which resulted in some new order and delivery delays, and the continued slowdown in refinance activity which led to a more competitive financial services environment. Additionally, during the quarter, we slowed our sales pace to match our construction activity. Nevertheless, we continue to see a healthy homebuilding market, particularly in our land-constrained markets, even though some of these markets are experiencing slightly slower sales as they absorb recent significant price appreciation."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "During the third quarter, our gross margin percentage on home sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute. Nonetheless, we remain well positioned to enhance future profitability as our gross margin in backlog has improved year-over-year."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "Assuming general economic stability, our record-level $6.1 billion backlog, our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our future outlook. We are increasing both our fiscal 2004 earnings per share goal to $5.70 from $5.50 per share and our fiscal 2005 earnings per share goal to $6.60 from $6.00 per share."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 21% in the third quarter of 2004 to $2.5 billion from $2.0 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 16% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 9,213 homes in the third quarter of 2004 from 7,929 homes last year. In the third quarter of 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2003. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $269,000 in the third quarter of 2004 from $257,000 in 2003.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $566.5 million, or 22.9%, in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $483.9 million, or 23.7%, in 2003. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.8% in both the third quarter of 2004 and 2003.
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $146.1 million and $53.9 million, or 36.9%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $67.1 million and $7.8 million, or 11.6%, respectively, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by each of the Company's regions, with a strong contribution from the Company's West Region. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $25.1 million last year. Management fees and other income, net totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $4.9 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $49.3 million last year. The decline in operating earnings in 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in refinance transactions and a more competitive mortgage environment, which resulted in reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations, compared to 2003.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in both the third quarter of 2004 and 2003.
 
Other Information
 
Earnings per share amounts and average shares outstanding for 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Company's January 2004 two-for-one stock split.
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 15% in the nine months ended August 31, 2004 to $6.2 billion from $5.4 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 12% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 3% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 23,473 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2004 from 20,956 homes last year. In the nine months ended August 31, 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2003. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $264,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2004 from $257,000 in 2003.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $1.4 billion, or 23.0%, in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to $1.2 billion, or 22.8%, in 2003. This improvement was partially offset by warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.6% in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to 11.3% in 2003.
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $387.4 million and $146.1 million, or 37.7%, respectively, in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to $171.3 million and $25.1 million, or 14.7%, respectively, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by each of the Company's regions, with a strong contribution from the Company's East and West Regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $28.9 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to $45.0 million last year. Management fees and other income, net totaled $47.0 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to $15.6 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $78.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2004, compared to $120.9 million last year. The decline in operating earnings in 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in refinance transactions and a more competitive mortgage environment, which resulted in reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations, compared to 2003. The decline in operating earnings was partially offset by a $6.5 million gain generated from monetizing the majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts.
