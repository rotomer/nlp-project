Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On December 15, 2004, Lennar Corporation issued a press release to announce its results of operations for the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The press release included a financial measure of the Company's earnings before interest and provision for income taxes, which is referred to in the press release as "EBIT," for the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2004, as well as a table reconciling the computation of EBIT to the Company's earnings for those periods. EBIT is not a financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's management uses EBIT because it believes this financial measure helps to compare the Company's operations with those of its competitors, by eliminating factors that differ from company to company for reasons that often are not related to the efficiency and effectiveness of a particular company's operations. The Company believes EBIT provides useful information to investors and analysts, because it will help them compare the efficiency and effectiveness of the Company's operations with those of its competitors.

Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We achieved record results for both the fourth quarter and the 2004 fiscal year. Strength in homebuilding and land operations, driven by our focus on the Lennar Process,' continues to propel our company to achieve these results. Demand for new homes has remained strong, driving company-wide orders up 5% in the fourth quarter even while Florida new orders and community openings lagged demand in the wake of a hyperactive hurricane season."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "Our homebuilding operations benefited substantially from our pricing power in land-constrained markets. Controlling an increasing number of homesites in such markets remains a significant competitive advantage for us. As a result, we remain well positioned for future success in those markets and our other strategic markets."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "We have excellent visibility as we enter 2005 and we expect our company to have another record year. In addition to our exceptional position in land-constrained markets, our $5.1 billion backlog, our 823 active communities at year-end and our strong balance sheet liquidity lead us to increase our fiscal 2005 earnings per share goal to $6.90 from our previous goal of $6.60."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $3.4 billion from $2.7 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 12% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 12% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 11,716 homes in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 10,456 homes last year. In the fourth quarter of 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2003. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $287,000 in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $255,000 in 2003.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $860.4 million, or 25.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $631.3 million, or 23.7%, in 2003. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 190 basis points due to an improvement in the Company's East and West Regions. This improvement was primarily attributable to pricing power, particularly in the Company's land-constrained markets, as well as a change in product mix.
3-3-3
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 9.9% in 2003.
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $53.4 million and $13.3 million, or 24.9%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $136.9 million and $48.2 million, or 35.2%, respectively, in 2003. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $37.0 million last year. This improvement resulted from an increase in homes delivered by the Company's unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures, as well as an increase in earnings from the Company's unconsolidated land joint ventures. Management fees and other income, net totaled $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $6.3 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $33.6 million last year, primarily due to an increase in loan originations offset by a more competitive mortgage environment.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 1.2% in 2003.
 
Other Information
 
Earnings per share amounts and average shares outstanding for 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Company's January 2004 two-for-one stock split.
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 19% in the year ended November 30, 2004 to $9.6 billion from $8.0 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 12% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 6% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 35,189 homes in the year ended November 30, 2004 from 31,412 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2003.

Gross margins on home sales were $2.3 billion, or 23.9%, in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $1.9 billion, or 23.1%, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by an improvement in the Company's East and West Regions. This improvement was primarily attributable to pricing power, particularly in the Company's land-constrained markets, as well as a change in product mix. This improvement was partially offset by warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.9% in both the year ended November 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $440.8 million and $159.4 million, or 36.2%, respectively, in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $308.2 million and $73.3 million, or 23.8%, respectively, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by each of the Company's regions, with a strong contribution from the Company's East and West Regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $90.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $81.9 million last year. This improvement resulted from an increase in homes delivered by the Company's unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures. Management fees and other income, net totaled $58.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $21.9 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $112.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $154.5 million last year. The decline in operating earnings was primarily due to a more competitive mortgage environment and a slowdown in refinance activity, which resulted in reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations. The decline in operating earnings was partially offset by a $6.5 million gain generated from monetizing the majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in both the year ended November 30, 2004 and 2003.
