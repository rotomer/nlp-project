Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are very pleased to report record results for our first quarter with an increase in revenues of 29% and net earnings growth of 39% over the prior year. These record results were driven by strength in our homebuilding operations, which generated strong margins resulting from our pricing power in land-constrained markets."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "The homebuilding industry continues to see strong demand resulting from positive demographic trends and supply constraints. As the industry continues to consolidate, we remain focused on targeting strategic opportunities to generate market share gains in our current markets as well as in new markets."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "As a result of our $6.0 billion backlog, we have excellent visibility and are comfortable increasing our 2005 earnings per share goal to $7.15 from $6.90. Given our strong balance sheet and strategic land holdings, we remain well positioned for future growth."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from homes sales increased 33% in the first quarter of 2005 to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 17% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 14% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 7,577 homes in the first quarter of 2005 from 6,495 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2004, with the biggest contribution coming from the Company's West region. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $292,000 in the first quarter of 2005 from $256,000 in 2004.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $544.4 million, or 24.6%, in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $373.8 million, or 22.5%, in 2004. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 210 basis points due to an improvement in the Company's West region, which was primarily attributable to increased deliveries and continued pricing power.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales improved to 12.1% in the first quarter of 2005, from 12.2% in 2004.
3-3-3
 
Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $75.4 million and $23.5 million, or 31.2%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $94.3 million and $35.6 million, or 37.8%, respectively, in 2004. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $5.3 million last year. This improvement resulted primarily from an increase in homes delivered by the Company's unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures. Management fees and other income, net totaled $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $18.0 million in 2004. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings for the Financial Services Division were $17.0 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $23.0 million last year, primarily due to reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment. This decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the Division's title operations.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.5% in both the first quarter of 2005 and 2004.
