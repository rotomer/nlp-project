Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report record results for our second quarter, which generated an increase in revenues from continuing operations of 25% and an increase in earnings per share from continuing operations of 27% over the prior year. These record results were driven by our ability to continue to capitalize on favorable pricing conditions within various strategic homebuilding markets in which we operate, as evidenced by a 150 basis point increase in gross margin on home sales."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "The homebuilding industry and Lennar in particular continue to thrive on strong consumer demand as a result of positive economic and demographic trends, particularly in land-constrained markets. As the industry has continued to benefit from favorable market conditions, we have continued to focus on strengthening our strategic market positions via both organic and acquisitive growth."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "Demand for our homes remained strong during the first half of 2005, and our record $7.3 billion backlog provides us with excellent visibility for the second half of our fiscal year. Given our strong balance sheet, strategic market positions and record backlog, we are comfortable increasing our 2005 earnings per share goal."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 27% in the second quarter of 2005 to $2.6 billion from $2.1 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 15% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 10% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 8,951 homes in the second quarter of 2005 from 7,765 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2004. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $293,000 in the second quarter of 2005 from $266,000 in 2004.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $654.1 million, or 24.9%, in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $483.7 million, or 23.4%, in 2004. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 150 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing conditions. This increase was primarily attributable to strong improvement in the Company's West region and improvement in the Company's East region (primarily Florida), which was partially offset by lower margins in the Company's Central region.
3-3-3
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales improved to 11.8% in the second quarter of 2005 from 12.1% in 2004. This improvement was primarily due to an increase in the number of new home deliveries in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Gross profit on land sales totaled $72.7 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $56.5 million in 2004. Some of these land sales were from consolidated joint ventures, which resulted in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense from these land sales and other activities of the consolidated joint ventures was $19.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2005 and 2004 and is included in management fees and other income (expense), net.
 
Management fees and other income (expense), net, totaled ($8.7) million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $18.7 million in 2004. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $21.7 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $14.0 million last year. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $19.0 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $32.0 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment, as well as a $6.5 million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts during the second quarter of 2004.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations were 1.4% in the second quarter of 2005, compared to 1.3% last year.
 
Loss on Redemption of 9.95% Senior Notes
 
In the second quarter of 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 9.95% senior notes, which resulted in a pretax loss on redemption of $34.9 million, or $0.13 per share diluted.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In the second quarter of 2005, the Company generated a $15.8 million pretax gain on the sale of a title subsidiary of the Financial Services Division. As a result of the sale, the subsidiary's results are presented as discontinued operations for the three months ended May 31, 2005 and 2004. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2005 were $10.3 million, or $0.06 per share diluted, compared to $0.2 million in the prior year.

Revenues from home sales increased 30% in the six months ended May 31, 2005 to $4.8 billion from $3.7 billion in 2004.

New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 16,528 homes in the six months ended May 31, 2005 from 14,260 homes last year.
