Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Our strong performance reflects the continued strength of the homebuilding market along with our intense focus on our homebuilding process. We exceeded our home delivery target through increased conversion of homes in backlog combined with a 340 basis point increase in gross margin percentage."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "New home sales activity continued to point to strong consumer demand as our new orders increased 24% year-over-year. As the industry continues to benefit from favorable market conditions, we continue to strengthen our position in strategic markets through organic and acquisitive growth."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "Assuming general economic stability and minimal impact from the recent hurricane activity, our record-level $8.1 billion backlog, strong balance sheet and strategic positioning give us confidence in our future outlook. We are increasing our fiscal 2005 earnings per share goal from $7.80 to $8.10 per share and establishing a fiscal 2006 earnings per share goal of $9.25."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 30% in the third quarter of 2005 to $3.2 billion from $2.5 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 14% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 14% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in the third quarter of 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 10,503 homes in the third quarter of 2005 from 9,213 homes last year. In the third quarter of 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2004.

Financial Services
 
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $70.2 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2005, compared to $77.6 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment in 2005, as well as a $6.5 million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the Division's title operations in 2005.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations were 1.4% in both the nine months ended August 31, 2005 and 2004.
 
Loss on Redemption of 9.95% Senior Notes
 
In 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 9.95% senior notes, which resulted in a pretax loss on redemption of $34.9 million, or $0.13 per share diluted.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In 2005, the Company generated a $15.8 million pretax gain on the sale of a subsidiary of the Financial Services Division's title company. As a result of the sale, the subsidiary's results are presented as discontinued operations for 2005 and 2004. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2005 were $10.7 million, or $0.07 per share diluted, compared to $0.6 million in the prior year.
