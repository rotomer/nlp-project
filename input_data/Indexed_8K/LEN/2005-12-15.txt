Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The intense focus on the fundamentals of our homebuilding process allowed us to achieve record results once again in fiscal 2005, as we exceeded our target and delivered a record 42,359 homes despite the 400 to 500 deliveries delayed due to the significant disruption caused by Hurricane Wilma. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2005, which resulted in strong revenue growth and a 210 basis point increase in gross margin percentage on new home deliveries."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "While the industry continues to be influenced by increased regulation, we expect our homebuilding operations to continue to benefit substantially from our access to homesites in land-constrained markets. Despite signs nationally of a more normalized level of activity with regards to sales pace and price appreciation, our capital investments in these strategic markets afford us a significant competitive advantage and allow us to be well positioned for future success."
 
Mr. Miller concluded, "As we enter fiscal 2006, our record-level $6.9 billion backlog, strong balance sheet and strategic access to homesites position us well to achieve our previously announced fiscal 2006 earnings per share goal of $9.25."
 
 
 
Homebuilding
 
Revenues from home sales increased 39% in the fourth quarter of 2005 to $4.7 billion from $3.4 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 18% increase in the number of home deliveries and an 18% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in the fourth quarter of 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 13,851 homes in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 11,716 homes last year. In the fourth quarter of 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2004. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $338,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005 from $287,000 in 2004.
 
Gross margins on home sales were $1.3 billion, or 27.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $860.4 million, or 25.6%, in 2004. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 140 basis points primarily due to product mix favoring our higher margin states, as well as a significant gross margin percentage improvement in Arizona and Florida.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 9.6% in both the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004.
 
Gross profit on land sales totaled $58.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $13.3 million in 2004. Some of these land sales were from consolidated joint ventures, which resulted in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense from these land sales and other activities of the consolidated joint ventures was $11.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 and is included in management fees and other income, net. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $11.5 million in 2004. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $79.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $61.8 million last year. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
 
Financial Services
 
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $33.1 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the Division's title operations, which generated higher profit per transaction in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 2004. This increase was partially offset by reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage operations due to a more competitive mortgage environment.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations were 1.3% in both the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004.

Financial Services
 
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $104.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $110.7 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment in 2005, as well as a $6.5 million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the Division's alarm monitoring contracts in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the Division's title operations in 2005.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations were 1.4% in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 1.3% in 2004.
 
Loss on Redemption of 9.95% Senior Notes
 
In 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 9.95% senior notes, which resulted in a pretax loss on redemption of $34.9 million, or $0.13 per share diluted, net of tax.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
In 2005, the Company generated a $15.8 million pretax gain on the sale of a subsidiary of the Financial Services Division's title company. As a result of the sale, the subsidiary's results are presented as discontinued operations for 2005 and 2004. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended November 30, 2005 were $10.7 million, or $0.06 per share diluted, compared to $1.0 million in the prior year.
