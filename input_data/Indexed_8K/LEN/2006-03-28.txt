Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report record results for our first quarter, where we produced a 35% increase in both revenues and earnings per share from continuing operations, compared to last year. These record results were supported by a strong performance from both our homebuilding and land divisions."
Mr. Miller continued, "While there has been a slower sales pace in certain markets in which we operate and price appreciation in these markets has moderated relative to the appreciation experienced in the past few years, we were still able to achieve a 4% increase in new orders during the first quarter. We are focused on maintaining a sales pace that supports our current and planned inventory levels, and we believe that our intense focus on asset management and our homebuilding manufacturing process will set the foundation to achieve a more evenflow production of home deliveries."
Mr. Miller concluded, "As a result of our $7.1 billion backlog, we believe 2006 will be another record year and are reaffirming our 2006 earnings per share goal of $9.25. Given our strong balance sheet liquidity, we are well positioned for organic growth as well as strategic growth opportunities as they arise."
Homebuilding
Revenues from homes sales increased 32% in the first quarter of 2006 to $2.9 billion from $2.2 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 18% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 12% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 8,904 homes in the first quarter of 2006 from 7,577 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2006, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $326,000 in the first quarter of 2006 from $292,000 in 2005.
Gross margins on home sales were $727.9 million, or 24.9%, in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $544.4 million, or 24.6%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 30 basis points due to an improvement in the Company's East region, primarily Florida, partially offset by decreases in the Central and West regions, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers, compared to last year.
3-3-3
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 13.0% in the first quarter of 2006, from 12.4% in 2005. The 60 basis point increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses resulting from an increase in the number of land divisions established to manage increased levels of owned and controlled homesites, as well as land sales activity, compared to prior year. Additionally, broker commissions increased compared to prior year. Management fees of $6.4 million received during 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation.
Gross profit on land sales totaled $49.1 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $23.5 million in 2005. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $38.2 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $16.1 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2005. Minority interest expense, net was $4.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $16.3 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the Division's mortgage and title operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment and a decrease in the number of title transactions.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005.
