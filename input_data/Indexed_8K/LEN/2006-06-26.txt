Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "After a long period of steady growth, the homebuilding industry has slowed, as evidenced by lower new orders and higher cancellation rates in many geographic markets across the country. These conditions are primarily the result of speculators exiting the market and changing homebuyer sentiment. Although current market conditions have softened, we believe favorable demographic trends and high employment levels bode well for long-term homebuilding fundamentals."
Mr. Miller continued, "Even while market conditions have been changing, we have maintained a focused and orderly approach to managing our operations with an intensified emphasis on maintaining strong cash flow generation and achieving evenflow production. This focus resulted in a 56% increase in revenues and a 41% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations, compared to our second quarter last year. However, we are experiencing slower new orders and higher cancellation rates. Consequently, the second half of the year will be more challenging. As a result, we are focusing our efforts on partially offsetting the effects of increased sales incentives by reducing land costs, production costs and selling, general and administrative expenses."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We have consistently focused on a balance sheet first approach to managing our operations. This strategy works particularly well in slower market cycles. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of stock while at the same time maintained a strong and liquid balance sheet as evidenced by our homebuilding debt to total capital of 33.5% and only $185 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Although we are revising our EPS goal downward to a range of $8.00 to $8.25 at this time, we recognize that market conditions are continually changing. Our operating strategy and strong balance sheet should enable us to respond to these changing conditions and to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased 53% in the second quarter of 2006 to $4.0 billion from $2.6 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 40% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 10% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 12,506 homes in the second quarter of 2006 from 8,951 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2006, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's regions, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $322,000 in the second quarter of 2006 from $293,000 in 2005. However, new orders during the second quarter of 2006 decreased to 11,757 homes, from 12,095 homes last year; and our backlog as of May 31, 2006 was 17,990 homes with a backlog dollar value of $6.5 billion, compared to 20,536 homes, with a backlog dollar value of $7.3 billion at May 31, 2005 and 19,458 homes with a backlog dollar value of $7.1 billion at February 28, 2006.

Gross margins on home sales were $946.5 million, or 23.5%, in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $654.1 million, or 24.9%, in the same quarter of 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased 140 basis points, compared to last year, due to decreases in the Central and West regions, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers, partially offset by a slight increase in the East Region. Gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2006 was 140 basis points lower than the 24.9% gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2006.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales improved to 11.8% in the second quarter of 2006, from 12.1% in 2005. The 30 basis point improvement was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales, partially offset by increases in broker commissions and advertising expenses. Management fees of $8.9 million received during the second quarter of 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation.
Gross profit on land sales totaled $41.1 million in the second quarter of 2006 (net of $21.8 million in write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land under option that the Company does not intend to purchase), compared to $72.7 million in 2005. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $21.7 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $16.4 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2005. Minority interest expense, net was $6.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services Division were $34.6 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $19.0 million last year. The increase was primarily due to increased profitability from the Division's mortgage operations as a result of increased volume and profit per loan.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2006 and 2005.

Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased 44% in the six months ended May 31, 2006 to $6.9 billion from $4.8 billion in 2005.

New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 21,410 homes in the six months ended May 31, 2006 from 16,528 homes last year.
