Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The U.S. housing market has continued to deteriorate, trailing down further and faster than anticipated. Under these difficult conditions, we remain focused on our strategy of carefully managing inventory, reducing construction costs and overhead, methodically tapering back production and emphasizing cash generation. We have limited our land purchases and reduced standing inventory through strategic asset management. Additionally, we have emphasized salesmanship and simplicity in the field which help control costs in the management of our business. We believe our strategy will continue to improve our cash flow and balance sheet from already excellent positions."
Mr. Miller continued, "Our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide a solid foundation for current operations during declining market conditions and will enable us to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities as the market solidifies."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We believe that our balance sheet-first approach to managing our business serves as an excellent strategy through both up and down cycles in the homebuilding industry. Although the economy remains strong and unemployment and interest rates remain relatively low, it is not clear that the homebuilding downturn has yet found a floor. Due to this uncertainty, we are updating our fourth quarter goal downward to a broad range of $1.00 to $1.30 per share."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased 21% in the third quarter of 2006 to $3.9 billion from $3.2 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 17% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 3% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 12,337 homes in the third quarter of 2006 from 10,503 homes last year. In the three months ended August 31, 2006, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and homebuilding other, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $316,000 in the third quarter of 2006 from $306,000 in 2005. New orders during the third quarter of 2006 decreased to 11,056, from 11,614 homes last year; and the Company's backlog as of August 31, 2006 was 16,008 homes with a backlog dollar value of $5.6 billion, compared to 21,818 homes with a backlog dollar value of $8.1 billion at August 31, 2005, and 17,990 homes with a backlog dollar value of $6.5 billion at May 31, 2006.

Gross margins on home sales were $729.2 million, or 18.7%, in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $846.4 million, or 26.3%, in the same quarter of 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased 760 basis points, compared to last year, due to decreases in all of the Company's homebuilding segments and homebuilding other, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers and $32.0 million of inventory valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2006 was also 480 basis points lower than the 23.5% gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2006.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales improved to 10.9% in the third quarter of 2006, from 11.3% in 2005. The 40 basis point improvement was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by increases in broker commissions and advertising expenses. Management fees of $10.3 million received during the third quarter of 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation.
Gross profit (loss) on land sales totaled ($0.3) million in the third quarter of 2006 (net of $15.8 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land under option that the Company does not intend to purchase and $11.8 million of inventory valuation adjustments), compared to gross profit of $46.4 million in 2005. Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($5.9) million in the third quarter of 2006 (which included $16.5 million in valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities), compared to $16.8 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $21.8 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $20.4 million in the third quarter of 2005. Minority interest expense, net was $1.1 million and $13.2 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $61.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $34.9 million last year. The increase was primarily due to a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segment's personal lines insurance policies, as well as increased profitability from the segment's mortgage operations as a result of increased volume and profit per loan.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in the three months ended August 31, 2006, compared to 1.3% in the same period last year.
