Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "As we noted in our pre-earnings release, market conditions have remained depressed through the end of our fourth quarter. In this environment, we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. We have continued to build-out our inventory, deliver our backlog and convert inventory into cash. With a balance sheet-first focus, we have priced our homes to market conditions and maintained an "inventory neutral" position. Accordingly, our land inventory and homes under construction have declined throughout the second half of 2006."
Mr. Miller continued, "As we look ahead to 2007, the strength of our balance sheet, together with our renegotiated land positions that reflect current market conditions, provide the springboard from which we will rebuild our margins. To that end, we have identified four focal points that will drive our margin improvement in 2007: right-sizing S,G&A expenses to match both current volume and efficiencies, reducing construction costs, redesigning product to meet today's market demand and building on land at current market prices. We will also continue to carefully match our starts to demand, and as a result, we estimate deliveries will decline in excess of 20% in 2007, compared to 2006."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Uncertain market conditions make it difficult to provide a 2007 earnings goal. While we know that the margin in our backlog will result in lower profitability in the first half of 2007, we believe that if the current environment of strong employment, low interest rates and a healthy economy continues, and the market for new homes demonstrates traditional, seasonal improvement, we will meet or exceed our 2006 earnings of $3.69 per share."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 14% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $4.0 billion from $4.7 billion in 2005. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 4% decrease in the number of home deliveries and an 11% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 13,285 homes in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 13,851 homes last year. In the fourth quarter of 2006, new home deliveries were lower primarily due to a decrease in the Company's Homebuilding West segment and Homebuilding Other, partially offset by an increase in the Company's Homebuilding East segment, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $302,000
3-3-3
in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $338,000 in 2005, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($47,300 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $10,600 per home delivered last year).
Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $576.6 million, or 14.4%, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $1.3 billion, or 27.0%, in the same quarter of 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $336.8 million, or 8.4%, in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to $239.8 million of inventory valuation adjustments ($138.9 million, $25.6 million, $59.7 million and $15.6 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other).
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 12.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006, from 9.8% in 2005. The 230 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues and increases in broker commissions and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Management fees of $11.8 million received during the fourth quarter of 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation.
Loss on land sales totaled $119.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, net of $111.1 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs ($73.4 million, $0.1 million, $27.2 million and $10.4 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) related to 9,395 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase and $33.3 million of inventory valuation adjustments ($16.6 million, $4.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East and Central segments and Homebuilding Other), compared to gross profit of $58.2 million in 2005. Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($59.6) million in the fourth quarter of 2006, which included $109.7 million of valuation adjustments ($24.6 million, $78.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East and West segments and Homebuilding Other) to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to $79.1 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $37.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Minority

interest expense, net was $1.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $42.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $34.6 million last year. The increase was primarily due to improved results from the segment's mortgage operations as a result of an increased capture rate and a higher percentage of fixed-rate loans.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 1.3% in the same period last year. The 50 basis point decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the year ended November 30, 2006 to $14.9 billion from $12.7 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 15% increase in the number of home deliveries in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 47,032 homes in the year ended November 30, 2006 from 40,882 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2006, new home deliveries were higher in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $315,000 in the year ended November 30, 2006 from $311,000 in 2005 despite higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($32,000 per home delivered in 2006, compared to $9,000 per home delivered in 2005).
Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $3.0 billion, or 20.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $3.3 billion, or 26.0%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $2.7 billion, or 18.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2006 due to $280.5 million of

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.9% and 11.1%, respectively, for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005.

Financial Services
Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services segment were $149.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $104.8 million last year. The increase was primarily due to a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segment's personal lines insurance policies, as well as increased profitability from the segment's mortgage operations as a result of increased volume and profit per loan.
