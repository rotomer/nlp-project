, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its first quarter ended February 28, 2007. First quarter net earnings in 2007 were $68.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to first quarter net earnings of $258.1 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, in 2006.
Miami, March 27, 2007  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The housing market continues to demonstrate overall weakness. While some markets are performing better than others, the typically stronger spring selling season has not yet materialized. These soft market conditions have been exacerbated by the well-publicized problems in the subprime lending market."
Mr. Miller continued, "As weak market conditions have persisted, we have continued to focus on our balance sheet first' strategy. Since early 2006, we have focused on fortifying our balance sheet by carefully managing inventory levels (converting both land and home inventory to cash) and significantly reducing land purchases and starts. Concurrently, we have adjusted our land assets where appropriate while we have written-off option deposits and pre-acquisition costs on land we no longer desire to close."

"Additionally, we completed the LandSource transaction this quarter, further strengthening our balance sheet with the receipt of approximately $700 million of cash during the quarter. The strong sponsorship of LandSource, coupled with the land availability primarily created by builders walking away from option deposits, positions us for new opportunities to purchase favorably-priced, larger land parcels within LandSource."
"While we are primarily focused on fortifying our balance sheet, we are concurrently focused on rebuilding our profit margins. Given current market conditions, we are continuing to pursue cost reductions, SG&A savings, product redesign and proper land pricing in order to see margin improvement starting in the second half of 2007. Until we see prices stabilize, however, we will not be able to project the timing or the scope of margin recovery, or set earnings goals for the company."
"We are very pleased that we ended our first quarter with our net homebuilding debt to total capital at 28.6%. Our strong balance sheet will position us well for success as market conditions recover. In the interim, we will continue to manage our business with day-by-day focus on maintaining a very low inventory balance and a consistent pressure on reducing costs as we rebuild our margins."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Given the state of the market, we do not expect to achieve our previously stated 2007 earnings goal, and we are not comfortable providing a new earnings goal at this time. Our company remains focused on managing through this downturn with a balance sheet first strategy, maintaining ample liquidity to position us well for future opportunities."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2007 to $2.6 billion from $2.9 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 4% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 8,566 homes in the first quarter of 2007 from 8,904 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2007, new home deliveries were lower primarily due to a decrease in the Company's Homebuilding Central and West segments, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $303,000 in the first quarter of 2007 from $326,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($45,500 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $13,800 per home delivered in the same period last year).

Gross margins on home sales excluding FAS 144 valuation adjustments were $409.2 million, or 15.6%, in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $727.9 million, or 24.9%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales including FAS 144 valuation adjustments were $360.9 million, or 13.8%, in the first quarter of 2007 due to $48.3 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($19.1 million, $11.3 million, $17.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other).
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 14.1% in the first quarter of 2007, from 13.0% in 2006. The 110 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues and an increase in broker commissions, partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses.
Loss on land sales totaled $26.5 million in the first quarter of 2007, net of $21.0 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs ($13.8 million, $1.3 million, $3.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) related to approximately 4,000 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase and $13.2 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($9.5 million, $3.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East and West segments and Homebuilding Other), compared to gross profit from land sales of $49.1 million last year.
In February 2007, the Company's LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to the Company of approximately $700 million. The Company's resulting ownership of LandSource is 16%. The Company will retain a promote opportunity allowing it to have a disproportionate share of the entity's future positive net cash flow. As a result of the recapitalization, the Company recognized a pretax gain of $175.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 and could potentially recognize an additional $400 million in future years, in addition to profits from its continuing ownership interest.

Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($14.2) million in the first quarter of 2007, which included $6.5 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($3.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East and West segments) to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $38.2 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2007 (including $2.6 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. Minority interest expense, net was $0.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006. Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $10.6 million last year. The increase was primarily due to improved results from the segment's mortgage operations as a result of an increased capture rate and a higher percentage of fixed-rate loans.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006.
