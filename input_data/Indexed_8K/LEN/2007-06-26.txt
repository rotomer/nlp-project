, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its second quarter ended May 31, 2007. Second quarter net loss in 2007 was $244.2 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to second quarter net earnings of $324.7 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, in 2006.
Miami, June 26, 2007  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The housing market has continued to deteriorate throughout the second quarter. The supply of new and existing homes has continued to increase resulting in declining home prices across our markets. We have continued to adjust pricing to meet today's market conditions. This has allowed us to carefully manage inventory levels; however, it has also resulted in lower margins and further impairments."

Mr. Miller continued, "We have remained focused on our balance sheet first approach. Through our quarterly operating performance and asset management review process, we have refined individual asset strategies and values based on current market conditions. As the market and our operating results have declined, our focus on strong cash flow generation has continued to strengthen our balance sheet."
"Our management team continues to be very focused on daily operations. We are using the slow market conditions to refine our operating processes and improve efficiencies. We are focused on the four steps of our operating strategy: rightsizing SG&A expenses, reducing hard construction costs, driving sales and aggressively managing our assets. We continue to aggressively manage our inventory levels by converting inventory to cash, and reducing both land purchases and starts."
Mr. Miller concluded, "As we look to our third quarter and the remainder of 2007, we continue to see weak, and perhaps deteriorating, market conditions. Given uncertain market conditions, we continue to lack visibility as to future results, but we currently expect to be in a loss position in our third quarter. While second quarter results are disappointing, in these weak market conditions, we will remain focused on our balance sheet first strategy which should position us well for future opportunities."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 33% in the second quarter of 2007 to $2.7 billion from $4.0 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 29% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 8,940 homes in the second quarter of 2007 from 12,506 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2007, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $298,000 in the second quarter of 2007 from $322,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($43,700 per home delivered in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $24,700 per home delivered in the same period last year).
3-3-3
Gross margins on home sales excluding FAS 144 valuation adjustments were $364.8 million, or 13.6%, in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $955.2 million, or 23.7%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. The gross margin percentage decline was highest in the Company's Homebuilding East and West segments. Gross margins on home sales were $193.2 million, or 7.2%, in the second quarter of 2007 including $171.6 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($100.3 million, $16.2 million, $49.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other), compared to gross margins on home sales of $946.5 million, or 23.5%, in the second quarter of 2006 including $8.7 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($5.9 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments).
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $78.9 million, or 17%, in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 14.7% in the second quarter of 2007, from 11.8% in 2006. The 290 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues and costs related to the consolidation of operations in certain markets.
Loss on land sales totaled $108.8 million in the second quarter of 2007, including $69.4 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments and $48.9 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 5,400 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the second quarter of last year, gross profit from land sales totaled $41.1 million, net of $16.6 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments and $21.8 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 4,800 homesites that were under option.

Write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs in the second quarter of 2007 were $16.0 million, $9.9 million, $21.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to $1.6 million, $0.5 million, $7.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively, in the prior year in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other.

respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding Central and West segments) to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $14.8 million last year.

Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $14.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $34.6 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased profitability from the segment's mortgage operations as a result of decreased volume and profit per loan, and $14.4 million of partial write-offs of land seller notes receivable due to the renegotiation of terms.

Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $10.7 million, or 19%, in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 1.6% in the second quarter of 2007, from 1.2% in 2006, primarily due to lower revenues.
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 24% in the six months ended May 31, 2007 to $5.3 billion from $6.9 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to an 18% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 17,506 homes in the six months ended May 31, 2007 from 21,410 homes last year.

The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $300,000 in the six months ended May 31, 2007 from $324,000 in 2006 primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($44,600 per home delivered in 2007, compared to $20,200 per home delivered in 2006).
5-5-5

As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 14.4% in the six months ended May 31, 2007, from 12.3% in 2006.

Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $40.7 million in the six months ended May 31, 2007, which included $34.0 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments ($3.8 million, $1.1 million and $29.1 million, respectively, in the Company's Homebuilding East, Central and West segments) to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $53.0 million last year.

In February 2007, the Company's LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to the Company of approximately $700 million. The Company's resulting ownership of LandSource is 16%. If LandSource reaches certain financial targets, the Company will have a disproportionate share of the entity's future positive net cash flow. As a result of the recapitalization, the Company recognized a pretax gain of $175.9 million in 2007 and could potentially recognize an additional $400 million in future years, in addition to profits from its continuing ownership interest.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $30.1 million in the six months ended May 31, 2007, compared to $45.2 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to $18.6 million of partial write-offs of land seller notes receivable due to the renegotiation of terms, and decreased profitability from the segment's title operations as a result of decreased volume and profit per transaction.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $15.7 million, or 14%, for the six months ended May 31, 2007, compared to 2006. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 1.6% in the six months ended May 31, 2007, from 1.4% in the same period last year, primarily due to lower revenues.
