, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its third quarter ended August 31, 2007. Third quarter net loss in 2007 was $513.9 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, compared to third quarter net earnings of $206.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in 2006.
Miami, September 25, 2007  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "It is already well documented that the housing market has continued to deteriorate throughout our third quarter. Heavy discounting by builders, and now the existing home market as well, has continued to drive pricing downward. Consumer confidence in housing has remained low, while the mortgage market has continued to redefine itself, creating higher cancellation rates."
 
Mr. Miller continued, "Our response to, and primary focus in, this environment continues to be to adjust pricing to meet current market conditions in order to keep inventories low and to keep our balance sheet positioned for the future. The net effect has been a continued deterioration of our net margin and accordingly, higher impairments to our inventory."
"We also have, and continue to, reduce overhead to be right-sized' for new and anticipated lower volume levels. While it has been challenging to stay ahead of rapidly adjusting market conditions and resulting revenue reductions, we have reduced our workforce to date by approximately 35% and expect continued reductions in the fourth quarter."
Mr. Miller concluded, "The combination of moving our stated inventory to current market valuations, right-sizing' our overhead to reduced volume levels and a stabilization of market conditions should ultimately bring us back to profitability."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 44% in the third quarter of 2007 to $2.2 billion from $3.9 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 41% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 6% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 7,266 homes in the third quarter of 2007 from 12,337 homes last year. In the third quarter of 2007, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $296,000 in the third quarter of 2007 from $316,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($46,000 per home delivered in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $35,900 per home delivered in the same period last year).
Gross margins on home sales excluding FAS 144 valuation adjustments were $304.1 million, or 14.0%, in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $761.2 million, or 19.5%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales were $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2007, which included $303.1 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $729.2 million, or 18.7%, in the third quarter of 2006, which included $32.0 million of FAS 144
valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding FAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of the Company's competitors and has been presented because the Company finds it useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $122.3 million, or 29%, in the third quarter of 2007, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount and variable compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 14.0% in the third quarter of 2007, from 10.9% in 2006. The 310 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues.
Loss on land sales totaled $344.7 million in the third quarter of 2007, which included $114.6 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments and $242.5 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 15,000 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the third quarter of last year, loss on land sales totaled $0.3 million, which included $11.8 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments and $15.8 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 8,400 homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $127.4 million in the third quarter of 2007, which included $138.7 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $5.9 million, which included $16.5 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities last year. Management fees and other expense, net, totaled $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 (including $32.1 million of valuation adjustments and $16.5 million of goodwill write-offs, partially offset by the recognition of $24.7 million of profit deferred at the time of the recapitalization of the LandSource joint venture), compared to management fees and other income, net of $21.8 million in the third quarter of 2006. Minority interest expense, net was $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006. Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income (expense), net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating loss for the Financial Services segment was $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to operating earnings of $61.7 million last year, which included a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segment's personal lines insurance policies. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in profitability from both the segment's mortgage and title operations
and $9.3 million of partial write-offs of land seller notes receivable. The decline in profitability was due to the overall weakness in the homebuilding market, which led to a decrease in volume and transactions for the mortgage and title operations compared to last year.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $6.2 million, or 12%, in the third quarter of 2007, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 1.9% in the third quarter of 2007, from 1.2% in 2006, primarily due to lower revenues.
Homebuilding

New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 24,772 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2007 from 33,747 homes last year. In the nine months ended August 31, 2007, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $299,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2007 from $321,000 in 2006 primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($45,000 per home delivered in 2007, compared to $25,900 per home delivered in 2006).

In the nine months ended August 31, 2006, gross profit from land sales totaled $89.9 million, net of $35.8 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments and $41.1 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 14,800 homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $168.1 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2007, which included $172.7 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $47.1 million, net of $16.7 million of FAS 144 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities last year.

In February 2007, the Company's LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to the Company of $707.6 million. The Company's resulting ownership of LandSource is 16%. If LandSource reaches certain financial targets, the Company will have a disproportionate share of the entity's future positive net cash flow. As a result of the recapitalization, the Company recognized a pretax gain of $175.9 million in 2007 and could potentially recognize additional profits in future years, in addition to profits from its continuing ownership interest.

Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $24.8 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2007, compared to $106.9 million last year, which included a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segment's personal lines insurance policies. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in profitability from both the segment's mortgage and title operations and $27.9 million of partial write-offs of land seller notes receivable. The decline in profitability was due to the overall weakness in the homebuilding market, which led to a decrease in volume and transactions for the mortgage and title operations compared to last year.
