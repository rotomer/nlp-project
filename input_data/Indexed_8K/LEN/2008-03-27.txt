Miami, March 27, 2008  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Market conditions have remained challenged and continued to deteriorate throughout our first quarter of 2008. The housing industry continues to be impacted by an unfavorable supply and demand relationship, which restricts the volume of new home sales and, concurrently, depresses home prices in most markets across the country."
2-2-2
"Home inventories have been expanding due to the high number of foreclosures, negotiated short sales,' and stretched homeowners looking to sell homes they can no longer afford. While sales are occurring and clearing prices are being reached, the pace of overall housing inventory growth is exceeding absorption at the current time."
"Concurrently, lower consumer confidence has quieted demand among prospective homebuyers and deterred them from a buying decision, while contraction in the lending markets has reduced the availability of credit for those prospective homebuyers that do wish to buy a home."
"On a more optimistic note, numerous initiatives, both private and public, have been designed and proposed to move towards stabilization and resolution. There is a growing consensus that the deterioration of the housing market has likely led us into recession, and the stabilization and recovery of the housing market will likely lead us out. Accordingly, we expect that some of these initiatives and the many that are being discussed will lead to a bottom and recovery."
Mr. Miller continued, "Our first quarter results reflect the fact that our balance sheet has been and continues to be our top priority. With most of the significant work on asset impairment behind us, throughout our first quarter we have remained focused on the delivery of our backlog, curtailing land purchases where possible, restructuring our joint ventures where necessary, and right-sizing our operations in order to protect cash, preserve value and fortify our balance sheet."
"To that end, we are very pleased that we ended our first quarter with over $1 billion in cash and no outstanding balance under our credit facility. In addition, we have reduced the number of our joint venture partnerships by approximately one-third to 180 and our maximum joint venture recourse debt by approximately one-half to $917 million, from their peak levels in 2006."
Mr. Miller concluded, "As we look ahead to the remainder of 2008, we recognize that market conditions are likely to remain challenging in the near term. Accordingly, we will continue to work diligently on rebuilding margins and ultimately, profitability as well. With a longer-term perspective, we believe that government action and normal market clearing will work together to lead the housing market to stabilization and ultimately recovery."

Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 64% in the first quarter of 2008 to $953.1 million from $2.6 billion in 2007. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 60% decrease in the number of home deliveries and an 8% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2008. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 3,437 homes in the first quarter of 2008 from 8,566 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2008, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2007. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $278,000 in the first quarter of 2008 from $303,000 in the same period last year, due to reduced pricing and higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($48,000 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $45,500 per home delivered in the same period last year).
Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $162.9 million, or 17.1%, in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $409.2 million, or 15.6%, in 2007. Gross margin percentage on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments increased compared to last year in the Company's Homebuilding East and West segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to the Company's lower inventory basis and continued focus on reducing construction costs. Gross margins on home sales were $136.7 million, or 14.3%, in the first quarter of 2008, which included $26.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $360.9 million, or 13.8%, in the first quarter of 2007, which included $48.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of the Company's competitors and has been presented because the Company finds it useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $194.4 million, or 53%, in the first quarter of 2008, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount and variable selling expense. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 18.4% in the first quarter of 2008, from 14.1% in 2007, which was primarily due to lower revenues.
4-4-4
Loss on land sales totaled $26.5 million in the first quarter of 2008, which included $15.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $16.9 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 2,600 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the first quarter of 2007, loss on land sales totaled $26.5 million, which included $13.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $21.0 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 4,000 homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, which included $18.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2007, which included $6.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.
Management fees and other income (expense), net, totaled ($21.8) million in the first quarter of 2008, which included $29.6 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to management fees and other income (expense), net, of $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2007, net of $2.6 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
Minority interest expense, net was $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007.
Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income (expense), net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating loss for the Financial Services segment was $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared to operating earnings of $15.9 million last year. The decline in profitability was primarily due to lower transactions in the segment's title operations, compared to last year as a result of the overall weakness in the housing market.

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $12.1 million, or 26%, in the first quarter of 2008, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 3.3% in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 1.7% in the same period last year, primarily due to lower revenues.
