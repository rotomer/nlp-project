On June 8, 2008, LandSource Communities Development LLC ("LandSource") and a number of its subsidiaries commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
We own a 16% limited partnership interest in LandSource. We also have a management agreement with LandSource and options to purchase land and other assets from LandSource. The bankruptcy filing could result in a substantial reduction (or total elimination) of our interest in LandSource, loss by LandSource of some or all of the properties it owns, termination of our management agreement with LandSource and land purchase options we have been granted by LandSource and loss of amounts owed to us by LandSource, and could expose us to claims.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
