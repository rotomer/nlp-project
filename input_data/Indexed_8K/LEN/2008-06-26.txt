, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its second quarter ended May 31, 2008. Second quarter net loss in 2008 was $120.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to second quarter net loss of $244.2 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, in 2007.
Miami, June 26, 2008  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Consistent with our expectations, the housing market has continued its downward trend throughout our second quarter. Foreclosures have increased while higher unemployment and diminishing consumer confidence have defined overall economic weakness. As a result, the housing market has continued to experience growth in inventory levels, which has depressed the prices of homes and restricted the ability to sell those homes in markets across the country."

"With the U.S. housing inventory growing in excess of absorption and limited credit availability, the prospect of further deterioration in the homebuilding industry will likely become reality absent Federal government action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Federal government will acknowledge the need for further reform and will institute programs designed to stabilize and facilitate the recovery of the housing market."
"Notwithstanding the bleak operating environment, Lennar made significant progress during our second quarter. We reduced our unsold completed inventory by 70% in the second quarter of 2008 from the second quarter of 2007 and by 47% from the first quarter of 2008, and now have on average less than one completed unsold home per community. In addition, we continued to make significant progress towards our goal of right-sizing our business, as reflected by a 60% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to a year ago. Our divisions are currently on track to achieve a future S,G&A annualized run rate of 10% by the end of our fiscal year. Moreover, given our success with asset reduction, we have shifted our primary focus to the execution of an efficient homebuilding model through the repositioning of our product to meet today's consumer demand and by aggressively reducing our construction costs."
"We are very pleased to end our second quarter with approximately $880 million in cash and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. We have also reduced our maximum joint venture recourse debt by approximately $1 billion from its peak level in 2006, which reflects a decrease of over 50%."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We recognize that the remainder of 2008 will likely see further deterioration in overall market conditions; however, we are confident that we remain well positioned with a strong balance sheet and properly scaled operations to navigate the current market downturn as a leaner and more efficient homebuilder."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 62% in the second quarter of 2008 to $1.0 billion from $2.7 billion in 2007. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 58% decrease in the number of home deliveries and an 8% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2008. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 3,729 homes in the second quarter of 2008 from 8,940 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2008, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2007. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $274,000 in the second quarter of 2008 from $298,000 in the same period last year, due to reduced pricing and higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($48,700 per home delivered in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $43,700 per home delivered in the same period last year).

Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $162.0 million, or 15.9%, in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $364.8 million, or 13.6%, in 2007. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, improved compared to last year primarily due to the Company's lower inventory basis and continued focus on repositioning its product and reducing construction costs. The largest gross margin percentage improvement was experienced in the Company's Homebuilding East segment. Gross margins on home sales were $88.4 million, or 8.7%, in the second quarter of 2008, which included $73.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $193.2 million, or 7.2%, in the second quarter of 2007, which included $171.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of the Company's competitors and has been presented because the Company finds it useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $238.9 million, or 60%, in the second quarter of 2008, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount and variable selling expense.
