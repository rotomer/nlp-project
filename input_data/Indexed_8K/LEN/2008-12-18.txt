, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2008. Fourth quarter net loss in 2008 was $811.0 million, or $5.12 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion, or $7.92 per diluted share, in 2007. The net loss for the year ended November 30, 2008 was $1.1 billion, or $7.00 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $12.31 per diluted share, in 2007.
Miami, December 18, 2008  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "Broad-based external pressures continued to negatively impact the housing market during the fourth quarter as rising unemployment, falling home prices, increased foreclosures, tighter credit and volatile equity markets further eroded consumer confidence and depressed home sales. As we enter fiscal 2009, we are hopeful the new administration will approve a major stimulus package to stimulate housing demand in order to stabilize housing values, which will reduce foreclosures and stabilize the financial markets, leading to restored consumer confidence."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the fourth quarter, we were intensely focused on maximizing our homebuilding operating cash flows. As a result, we ended our fourth quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we reduced our land expenditures by almost 70% quarter-over-quarter, converted 127% of our backlog into deliveries despite difficult market conditions and continued to right-size our business as S,G&A expenses as a percentage of home sales improved 100 basis points year-over-year."
"Along with significantly enhancing our balance sheet liquidity, we reduced the number of our unconsolidated joint ventures to 116, a 20% decrease from the third quarter, and reduced our maximum unconsolidated joint venture recourse debt to $520 million, a 71% decrease from the peak in 2006."
Mr. Miller concluded, "In 2009, cash generation will continue to be our top priority. We will convert inventory to cash and reduce both our land purchases and homebuilding starts. In addition, we will reduce our cash outflows by continuing to right-size our overhead to improve our S,G&A percentage."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 40% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $1.2 billion from $2.0 billion in 2007. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 34% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 10% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2008. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 4,484 homes in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 6,810 homes last year. In the fourth quarter of 2008, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2007. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $262,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 from $291,000 in the same period last year, due to reduced pricing. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $51,400 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $58,800 per home delivered in the same period last year.

Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $200.8 million, or 17.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $240.4 million, or 12.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, improved compared to last year, primarily due to the Company's lower inventory basis and continued focus on repositioning its product and reducing construction costs. Gross margins on home sales were $137.4 million, or 11.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $63.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $15.6 million, or 0.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2007, which included $224.8 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of the Company's competitors and has been presented because the Company finds it useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $131.8 million, or 44%, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the consolidation of divisions, which resulted in reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expense and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008, from 15.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Losses on land sales totaled $72.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $16.7 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $62.9 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 2,700 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the fourth quarter of 2007, losses on land sales totaled $1.2 billion, which included $970.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $217.6 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 12,500 homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $2.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $194.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which included $191.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.
Management fees and other expense, net, totaled $78.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $56.3 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities and $19.4 million of write-offs of notes receivable, compared to management fees and other expense, net, of $83.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which included $85.8 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
Minority interest income (expense), net was ($4.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to minority interest income (expense), net of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Due to the Company's termination of its right to purchase certain LandSource assets, the Company recognized deferred profit of $101.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 (net of $31.8 million of write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs and other write-offs) related to the recapitalization of the Company's LandSource joint venture in 2007.
Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other expense, net and minority interest income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Change in Reportable Segments
The Company has disaggregated its Houston homebuilding division from its Homebuilding Central reportable segment and has presented Houston as a separate reportable segment due to the division achieving a quantitative threshold set forth in SFAS 131. All prior year segment information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. The changes in reportable segments have no effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Financial Services
Operating loss for the Financial Services segment was $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to an operating loss of $18.7 million in the same period last year. The reduction in the operating loss was primarily a result of increased profitability in the segment's mortgage operations and a reduced loss in the segment's title operations.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $4.5 million, or 12%, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008, from 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007, due to lower revenues.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
SFAS 109 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. As a result of the Company's operational results for the three months ended November 30, 2008, the Company has now incurred cumulative losses over the evaluation period it established in accordance with SFAS 109. Accordingly, based on the evaluation of available evidence including the Company's cumulative losses in the evaluation period, its current level of profits and losses and the current market conditions, the Company has recorded a non-cash valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of $730.8 million during the three months ended November 30, 2008. In future periods, the valuation allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the Company's deferred tax assets will be realized.

Revenues from home sales decreased 56% in the year ended November 30, 2008 to $4.2 billion from $9.5 billion in 2007.

New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 15,344 homes in the year ended November 30, 2008 from 31,582 homes last year.
