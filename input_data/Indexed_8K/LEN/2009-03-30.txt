Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "The housing market continued its downward trend throughout our first quarter. Despite historically low interest rates and some indicators pointing toward market stabilization, low consumer confidence, increased unemployment and growing foreclosure rates negatively impacted new home sales in most of our markets. While we are hopeful that the recent actions taken by the Federal government will help stimulate housing demand and restore consumer confidence, we continue to adjust our business to adapt to market conditions."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the first quarter, we continued to focus on returning to profitability by concentrating on the basics of our homebuilding operations. We remained focused on repositioning our product to meet today's consumer demand for more affordable product. We reduced our construction costs by re-bidding and re-tooling our product and eliminated S, G & A expenses by restructuring our operations and consolidating operating divisions in the wake of declining volume levels."
"We remain focused on maintaining strong liquidity as we ended our first quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and a responsible homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio, net of homebuilding cash, of 37.4%. We also reduced the number of our unconsolidated joint ventures to 95 from 116 at November 30, 2008 and reduced our maximum unconsolidated joint venture recourse debt to $474 million from $520 million at November 30, 2008."
Mr. Miller concluded, "As we continue to focus on homebuilding profitability and on cash generation, we are well positioned to weather the current challenges and to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."
 
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 45% in the first quarter of 2009 to $522.8 million from $953.1 million in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 38% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 12% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 2,136 homes in the first quarter of 2009 from 3,437 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008. The average sales price of homes

delivered decreased to $244,000 in the first quarter of 2009 from $278,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to reduced pricing. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $50,500 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $48,000 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2008.
Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $75.0 million, or 14.3%, in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $162.9 million, or 17.1%, in 2008. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, decreased compared to last year, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales. Gross margins on home sales were $34.2 million, or 6.5%, in the first quarter of 2009, which included $40.8 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $136.7 million, or 14.3%, in the first quarter of 2008, which included $26.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure. This financial measure is disclosed by certain of the Company's competitors. The Company finds it useful and important in evaluating its performance because it discloses the Company's gross margins with regard to new homes the Company actually delivers in the periods presented. The Company believes that disclosing this information is helpful to readers of its financial statements by enabling them to compare the gross margins of new homes the Company actually delivers during the periods presented with those of its competitors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $73.8 million, or 42%, in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reduction in associate headcount, variable selling expenses and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2009, from 18.4% in the first quarter of 2008, due to lower revenues.
Losses on land sales totaled $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2009, which included $0.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $10.2 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 1,100 homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the first quarter of 2008, losses on land sales totaled $26.5 million, which included $15.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $16.9 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to approximately 2,600 homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, which included $18.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.
4-4-4
Other income (expense), net, totaled ($47.8) million in the first quarter of 2009, which included $37.2 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to other income (expense), net, of ($21.8) million in the first quarter of 2008, which included $29.6 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
Minority interest income (expense), net was $1.7 million and ($0.2) million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008.
Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, other income (expense), net and minority interest income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment was $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. The improvement in the Financial Services segment was primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of the Company's focus on cost reductions in the segment's mortgage and title operations.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $6.8 million, or 20%, in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 4.7% in the first quarter of 2009, from 3.3% in the first quarter of 2008, due to lower revenues.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
SFAS 109 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. As a result of its net loss during the three months ended February 28, 2009, the Company generated deferred tax assets of $57.7 million and recorded a non-cash valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS 109 against the entire amount of deferred tax assets generated.
