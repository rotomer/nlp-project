For a description of the Distribution Agreements, see the disclosure under the caption "Plan of Distribution" contained in the Company's Prospectus Supplement dated April 20, 2009, which has been filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Distribution Agreements are incorporated by reference herein.
     The Shares will be offered pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-151924) (the "Registration Statement") which became effective on June 25, 2008.

Exhibit 5.1
April 20, 2009
Lennar Corporation 700 Northwest 107th Avenue Miami, FL 33172
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Lennar Corporation ("Lennar") in connection with (i) a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159124) (such registration statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Registration Statement"), filed by Lennar with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and (ii) the Prospectus Supplement, dated April 20, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), filed by Lennar with the Commission relating to the issuance and sale by Lennar of shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.10 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $275,000,000 and which shall not exceed 35,714,286 shares (the "Shares") in accordance with distribution agreements, dated as of April 20, 2009 (the "Distribution Agreements"), between Lennar and each of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as agents.
Based on the foregoing, and such other examination of law and fact as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that the Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered by Lennar pursuant to the Distribution Agreements will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to Lennar's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 20, 2009 and to the incorporation by reference of this opinion in the Registration Statement and to the reference to us under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving that consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Clifford Chance US LLP

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 383 Madison Avenue New York, New York 10179
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Lennar Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as agent and/or principal under any Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 1(a) below) ("JPMS"), with respect to the issuance and sale from time to time by the Company, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions described below (this "Agreement"), of shares (the "Shares") of Class A common stock, $0.10 par value per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), of the Company having an aggregate Gross Sales Price (as defined in Section 2(b) below) of up to $275,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount") on the terms set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement. The Shares are described in the Prospectus referred to below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate Gross Sales Price of Shares sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement (each as defined below) exceed the Maximum Amount.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-151924) for the registration of the Shares and other securities of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"); and such registration statement sets forth the material terms of the offering, sale and plan of distribution of the Shares and contains additional information concerning the Company and its business. As used herein, "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, as amended at the time of such registration statement's effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act, as such section applies to JPMS, including (1) all documents filed as a part thereof or incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein and (2) any information contained or incorporated by reference in a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, to the extent such information is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Securities Act, to be part of the registration statement at the effective time. "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus dated June 25, 2008, filed as part of the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such prospectus; "Prospectus Supplement" means the most recent prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, to be filed by the Company with the Commission
 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on or before the second business day after the date of its first use in connection with a public offering or sale of Shares pursuant hereto (or such earlier time as may be required under the Securities Act), in the form furnished by the Company to JPMS in connection with the offering of the Shares; "Prospectus" means the Prospectus Supplement (and any additional prospectus supplement prepared in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4(b) or 4(g) of this Agreement and filed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b)) together with the Basic Prospectus attached to or used with the Prospectus Supplement; and "Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses" has the meaning set forth in Section 3(b). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed to refer to and include the documents, if any, incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), including, unless the context otherwise requires, the documents, if any, filed as exhibits to such Incorporated Documents; , that the Company and JPMS agree that any representations or warranties contained in any such exhibits to the Incorporated Documents are not deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus. Any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall, unless stated otherwise, be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") on or after the initial effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
provided, however
     The Company has also entered into distribution agreements (the "Alternative Distribution Agreements"), dated of even date herewith, with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (each, an "Alternative Agent," and together with JPMS, the "Agents"). The aggregate Gross Sales Price of the Shares that may be sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, the Alternative Distribution Agreements and any Alternative Terms Agreement shall not exceed the Maximum Amount. This Agreement and the Alternative Distribution Agreements are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Distribution Agreements."
     The Company and JPMS agree as follows:
     1. .
Issuance and Sale
 
 
     2. .
Transaction Notices and Terms Agreements
     (i) the NYSE Business Day(s) on which the Shares subject to such Agency Transaction are intended to be sold (each, a "Purchase Date");
     (ii) the maximum number of Shares that the Company intends to sell (the "Specified Number of Shares") on, or over the course of, such Purchase Date(s); that the number of Shares sold on each such Purchase Date shall be no more than 25% of the average daily trading volume in the Class A Common Stock for the 30 business days preceding the date of delivery of the Transaction Notice (as communicated to the Company by JPMS) or as otherwise agreed between the Company and JPMS; and
provided
 
     (iii) the lowest price, if any, at which the Company is willing to sell Shares on each such Purchase Date or a formula pursuant to which such lowest price shall be determined (each, a "Floor Price").
     A Transaction Notice shall not set forth a Specified Number of Shares that has an aggregate Gross Sales Price, when added with the Gross Sales Price of the Shares previously purchased and to be purchased pursuant to pending Transaction Notices (if any) hereunder, any Terms Agreement, an Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement, results in a total Gross Sales Price that exceeds the Maximum Amount.
     Provided that JPMS confirms to the Company the number of Shares sold in accordance with Section 1(d) above, the Company shall have responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold, or for otherwise monitoring the availability of Shares for sale under the Registration Statement. In the event that more than one Transaction Notice with respect to any Purchase Date(s) is accepted by the Company, the latest executed Transaction Notice shall govern any sales of Shares for the relevant Purchase Date(s), except to the extent of any action occurring pursuant to a prior accepted Transaction Notice and prior to the acceptance of such latest Transaction Notice. The Company or JPMS may, upon notice to the other party hereto by telephone (confirmed promptly by e-mail or facsimile), suspend the offering of the Shares for any reason; that such suspension or termination shall not affect or impair the parties' respective obligations with respect to the Shares sold hereunder prior to the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms of any Agency Transaction contemplate that Shares shall be sold on more than one Purchase Date, then the Company and JPMS shall mutually agree to such additional terms and conditions as they deem reasonably necessary in respect of such multiple Purchase Dates, and such additional terms and conditions shall be set forth in the relevant Transaction Notice and be binding to the same extent as any other terms contained therein.
provided, however,
     References herein to this Agreement shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include all Transaction Notices.
 
 
     3. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, JPMS, on and as of (i) the date hereof, (ii) each date on which the Company and JPMS agree upon a Transaction Notice (a "Time of Acceptance") or the Company executes and delivers a Terms Agreement, (iii) each Time of Sale (as defined below), (iv) each Settlement Date and (v) each Bring-Down Delivery Date (as defined in Section 6(b)) (each such date listed in (i) through (v), a "Representation Date"), as follows:

     Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any subsidiary and delivered to JPMS or to counsel to JPMS pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to JPMS as to the matters covered thereby.
     4. . The Company hereby agrees with JPMS as follows:

     (iii) a "comfort" letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP, addressed to the Agents and dated the date of this Agreement, addressing such matters as the Agents may reasonably request;
     (iv) evidence that the Shares have been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject only to notice of issuance, on or before the date hereof;
     (v) a certificate signed by the Company's corporate secretary, annexing, among other documents, the resolutions duly adopted by the Company's board of directors authorizing the Company's execution of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance and sale of the Shares; and
     (vi) such other documents as JPMS shall reasonably request; and
     6. . The Company further covenants and agrees with JPMS as follows:
Additional Covenants of the Company
 
 
     All opinions, letters and other documents referred to in Sections 6(b) through (d) above shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to JPMS. JPMS will provide the Company with such notice (which may be oral, and in such case, will be confirmed via e-mail or facsimile as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter) as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances when requesting an opinion, letter or other document referred to in Sections 6(b) through (d) above.
     7. . JPMS's obligation to solicit purchases on an agency basis for the Shares or otherwise take any action pursuant to a Transaction Notice that has
Conditions of JPMS's Obligation
 
been accepted by the Company and to purchase the Shares pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

     (iv) From the date of this Agreement, no event or condition of a type described in Section 3(e) hereof shall have occurred or shall exist, which event or condition is not described in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto) or the Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto) and the effect of which in the reasonable judgment of JPMS makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the applicable Settlement Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, as the case may be, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     (v) The Shares to be issued pursuant to the Transaction Notice or pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as applicable, shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject only to notice of issuance.
     (vi) (A) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any federal, state or foreign governmental or regulatory authority that would, as of the relevant Settlement Date, prevent the issuance or sale of the Shares and (B) no injunction or order of any federal, state or foreign court shall have been issued that would, as of the relevant Settlement Date, prevent the issuance or sale of the Shares.
 
     (vii) (A) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, no proceeding for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act shall have been received by the Company; (B) the Prospectus and each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Securities Act (in the case of any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Securities Act); (C) all requests by the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the satisfaction of JPMS; and (D) no suspension of the qualification of the Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and no initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes, will have occurred and be in effect.
     (viii) No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall have been filed to which JPMS shall have reasonably objected in writing.
     (ix) Subsequent to the relevant Time of Acceptance or the relevant Time of Sale, as the case may be, (A) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act and (B) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, or has changed its outlook with respect to, its rating of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading).

Notices
     11. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that JPMS is acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Shares contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, JPMS is not advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and JPMS shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by JPMS of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of JPMS and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
No Fiduciary Relationship
 
     12. .
Governing Law; Construction
     13. . Each of JPMS and the Company, on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates, waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim, whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise, in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement.
Waiver of Jury Trial
     14. . The agreements set forth herein and in any Terms Agreement have been and are made solely for the benefit of JPMS and the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof, the controlling persons, directors and officers referred to in such section, and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, personal representatives and executors and administrators. No other person, partnership, association or corporation (including a purchaser, as such purchaser, from JPMS) shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement.
Parties in Interest
     15. . This Agreement and any Terms Agreement may be signed in counterparts (which may include counterparts delivered by any standard form of telecommunication), each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
     16. . This Agreement shall be binding upon JPMS and the Company and their respective successors and assigns and any successor or assign of any substantial portion of the Company's and JPMS's respective businesses and/or assets.
Successors and Assigns
     17. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and JPMS contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or JPMS pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Shares and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or JPMS.
Survival
     18. . For purposes of this Agreement, except where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
Certain Defined Terms
     19. . No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor any consent or approval to any departure therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto.
Amendments or Waivers
 
     20. . JPMS, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank. Because JPMS is a separately incorporated entity, it is solely responsible for its own contractual obligations and commitments, including obligations with respect to sales and purchases of securities. Securities sold, offered or recommended by JPMS are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank and are not otherwise an obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank.
Miscellaneous
     A lending affiliate of JPMS may have lending relationships with issuers of securities underwritten or privately placed by JPMS. To the extent required under the securities laws, prospectuses and other disclosure documents for securities underwritten or privately placed by JPMS will disclose the existence of any such lending relationships and whether the proceeds of the issue will be used to repay debts owed to affiliates of JPMS.
     JPMS and one or more of its affiliates may make markets in the Class A Common Stock or other securities of the Company, in connection with which they may buy and sell, as agent or principal, for long or short account, shares of the Class A Common Stock or other securities of the Company, at the same time that JPMS is acting as agent pursuant to this Agreement; that JPMS acknowledges and agrees that any such transactions are not being, and shall not be deemed to have been, undertaken at the request or direction of, or for the account of, the Company, and that the Company has and shall have no control over any decision by JPMS and its affiliates to enter into any such transactions.
provided
 
     If the foregoing correctly sets forth the understanding among the Company and JPMS, please so indicate in the space provided below for the purpose, whereupon this letter and your acceptance shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and JPMS.
Accepted and agreed to as of the date first above written:
 
Exhibit A

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 383 Madison Avenue New York, New York 10179
Dear Sirs:
     Lennar Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Distribution Agreement, dated April 20, 2009 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMS"), to issue and sell to JPMS the securities specified in the Schedule hereto (the "Purchased Securities") [, and solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments in a Principal Transaction, to grant to JPMS the option to purchase the additional securities specified in the Schedule hereto (the "Additional Securities")]. Unless otherwise defined below, capitalized terms defined in the Distribution Agreement shall have the same meanings when used herein.
     [Solely in connection with a Principal Transaction, JPMS shall have the right to purchase from the Company all or a portion of the Additional Securities as may be necessary to cover over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Purchased Securities, at the same purchase price per share to be paid by JPMS to the Company for the Purchased Securities. This option may be exercised by JPMS at any time (but not more than once) on or before the thirtieth day following the date hereof, by written notice to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of shares of Additional Securities as to which the option is being exercised, and the date and time when the Additional Securities are to be delivered (such date and time being herein referred to as the "Option Settlement Date"); , , that the Option Settlement Date shall not be earlier than the Settlement Date (as set forth in the Schedule hereto) nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised. Payment of the purchase price for the Additional Securities shall be made at the Option Settlement Date in the same manner and at the same office as the payment for the Purchased Securities.]
provided
however
     Each of the provisions of the Distribution Agreement not specifically related to the solicitation by JPMS, as agent of the Company, of offers to purchase securities is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and shall be deemed to be part of this Terms Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein. Each of the representations,
 
warranties and agreements set forth therein shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of this Terms Agreement [and] [,] the Settlement Date [and any Option Settlement Date].
     An amendment to the Registration Statement (as defined in the Distribution Agreement), or a supplement to the Prospectus, as the case may be, relating to the Purchased Securities [and the Additional Securities], in the form heretofore delivered to JPMS is now proposed to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Distribution Agreement which are incorporated herein by reference, the Company agrees to issue and sell to JPMS and the latter agrees to purchase from the Company, the Purchased Securities at the time and place and at the purchase price set forth in the Schedule hereto.
     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement to the contrary, the Company consents to JPMS trading in the Class A Common Stock for JPMS's own account and for the account of its clients at the same time as sales of the Shares occur pursuant to this Agreement.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, whereupon this Terms Agreement, including those provisions of the Distribution Agreement incorporated herein by reference, shall constitute a binding agreement between JPMS and the Company.

The Shares are described in the Prospectus referred to below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate Gross Sales Price of Shares sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement (each as defined below) exceed the Maximum Amount.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-151924) for the registration of the Shares and other securities of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"); and such registration statement sets forth the material terms of the offering, sale and plan of distribution of the Shares and contains additional information concerning the Company and its business. As used herein, "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, as amended at the time of such registration statement's effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act, as such section applies to Citi, including (1) all documents filed as a part thereof or incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein and (2) any information contained or incorporated by reference in a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, to the extent such information is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Securities Act, to be part of the registration statement at the effective time. "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus dated June 25, 2008, filed as part of the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such prospectus; "Prospectus Supplement" means the most recent prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, to be filed by the Company with the Commission
 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on or before the second business day after the date of its first use in connection with a public offering or sale of Shares pursuant hereto (or such earlier time as may be required under the Securities Act), in the form furnished by the Company to Citi in connection with the offering of the Shares; "Prospectus" means the Prospectus Supplement (and any additional prospectus supplement prepared in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4(b) or 4(g) of this Agreement and filed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b)) together with the Basic Prospectus attached to or used with the Prospectus Supplement; and "Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses" has the meaning set forth in Section 3(b).

     The Company has also entered into distribution agreements (the "Alternative Distribution Agreements"), dated of even date herewith, with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (each, an "Alternative Agent," and together with Citi, the "Agents"). The aggregate Gross Sales Price of the Shares that may be sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, the Alternative Distribution Agreements and any Alternative Terms Agreement shall not exceed the Maximum Amount. This Agreement and the Alternative Distribution Agreements are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Distribution Agreements."
     The Company and Citi agree as follows:
 
 
     (i) the NYSE Business Day(s) on which the Shares subject to such Agency Transaction are intended to be sold (each, a "Purchase Date");
     (ii) the maximum number of Shares that the Company intends to sell (the "Specified Number of Shares") on, or over the course of, such Purchase Date(s); that the number of Shares sold on each such Purchase Date shall be no more than 25% of the average daily trading volume in the Class A Common Stock for the 30 business days preceding the date of delivery of the Transaction Notice (as communicated to the Company by Citi) or as otherwise agreed between the Company and Citi; and
provided

The Company or Citi may, upon notice to the other party hereto by telephone (confirmed promptly by e-mail or facsimile), suspend the offering of the Shares for any reason; that such suspension or termination shall not affect or impair the parties' respective obligations with respect to the Shares sold hereunder prior to the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms of any Agency Transaction contemplate that Shares shall be sold on more than one Purchase Date, then the Company and Citi shall mutually agree to such additional terms and conditions as they deem reasonably necessary in respect of such multiple Purchase Dates, and such additional terms and conditions shall be set forth in the relevant Transaction Notice and be binding to the same extent as any other terms contained therein.
provided, however,
     References herein to this Agreement shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include all Transaction Notices.

     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Distribution Agreement which are incorporated herein by reference, the Company agrees to issue and sell to Citi and the latter agrees to purchase from the Company, the Purchased Securities at the time and place and at the purchase price set forth in the Schedule hereto.

shall be no more than 25% of the average daily trading volume in the Class A Common Stock for the 30 business days preceding the date of delivery of the Transaction Notice (as communicated to the Company by Merrill Lynch) or as otherwise agreed between the Company and Merrill Lynch; and
     (iii) the lowest price, if any, at which the Company is willing to sell Shares on each such Purchase Date or a formula pursuant to which such lowest price shall be determined (each, a "Floor Price").
     A Transaction Notice shall not set forth a Specified Number of Shares that has an aggregate Gross Sales Price, when added with the Gross Sales Price of the Shares previously purchased and to be purchased pursuant to pending Transaction Notices (if any) hereunder, any Terms Agreement, an Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement, results in a total Gross Sales Price that exceeds the Maximum Amount.
     Provided that Merrill Lynch confirms to the Company the number of Shares sold in accordance with Section 1(d) above, the Company shall have responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold, or for otherwise monitoring the availability of Shares for sale under the Registration Statement. In the event that more than one Transaction Notice with respect to any Purchase Date(s) is accepted by the Company, the latest executed Transaction Notice shall govern any sales of Shares for the relevant Purchase Date(s), except to the extent of any action occurring pursuant to a prior accepted Transaction Notice and prior to the acceptance of such latest Transaction Notice. The Company or Merrill Lynch may, upon notice to the other party hereto by telephone (confirmed promptly by e-mail or facsimile), suspend the offering of the Shares for any reason; that such suspension or termination shall not affect or impair the parties' respective obligations with respect to the Shares sold hereunder prior to the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms of any Agency Transaction contemplate that Shares shall be sold on more than one Purchase Date, then the Company and Merrill Lynch shall mutually agree to such additional terms and conditions as they deem reasonably necessary in respect of such multiple Purchase Dates, and such additional terms and conditions shall be set forth in the relevant Transaction Notice and be binding to the same extent as any other terms contained therein.
provided, however,
     References herein to this Agreement shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include all Transaction Notices.

     [Solely in connection with a Principal Transaction, Merrill Lynch shall have the right to purchase from the Company all or a portion of the Additional Securities as may be necessary to cover over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Purchased Securities, at the same purchase price per share to be paid by Merrill Lynch to the Company for the Purchased Securities.

Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of shares of Additional Securities as to which the option is being exercised, and the date and time when the Additional Securities are to be delivered (such date and time being herein referred to as the "Option Settlement Date"); , , that the Option Settlement Date shall not be earlier than the Settlement Date (as set forth in the Schedule hereto) nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised.

Exhibit 99.4
April 20, 2009
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. 60 Wall Street New York, New York 10005
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Lennar Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as agent and/or principal under any Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 1(a) below) ("Deutsche Bank"), with respect to the issuance and sale from time to time by the Company, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions described below (this "Agreement"), of shares (the "Shares") of Class A common stock, $0.10 par value per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), of the Company having an aggregate Gross Sales Price (as defined in Section 2(b) below) of up to $275,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount") on the terms set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement. The Shares are described in the Prospectus referred to below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate Gross Sales Price of Shares sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement (each as defined below) exceed the Maximum Amount.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-151924) for the registration of the Shares and other securities of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"); and such registration statement sets forth the material terms of the offering, sale and plan of distribution of the Shares and contains additional information concerning the Company and its business. As used herein, "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, as amended at the time of such registration statement's effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act, as such section applies to Deutsche Bank, including (1) all documents filed as a part thereof or incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein and (2) any information contained or incorporated by reference in a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, to the extent such information is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Securities Act, to be part of the registration statement at the effective time. "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus dated June 25, 2008, filed as part of the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such prospectus; "Prospectus Supplement" means the most recent prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, to be filed by the Company with the Commission
 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on or before the second business day after the date of its first use in connection with a public offering or sale of Shares pursuant hereto (or such earlier time as may be required under the Securities Act), in the form furnished by the Company to Deutsche Bank in connection with the offering of the Shares; "Prospectus" means the Prospectus Supplement (and any additional prospectus supplement prepared in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4(b) or 4(g) of this Agreement and filed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b)) together with the Basic Prospectus attached to or used with the Prospectus Supplement; and "Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses" has the meaning set forth in Section 3(b). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed to refer to and include the documents, if any, incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), including, unless the context otherwise requires, the documents, if any, filed as exhibits to such Incorporated Documents; , that the Company and Deutsche Bank agree that any representations or warranties contained in any such exhibits to the Incorporated Documents are not deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus. Any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall, unless stated otherwise, be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") on or after the initial effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
provided, however
     The Company has also entered into distribution agreements (the "Alternative Distribution Agreements"), dated of even date herewith, with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (each, an "Alternative Agent," and together with Deutsche Bank, the "Agents"). The aggregate Gross Sales Price of the Shares that may be sold pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, the Alternative Distribution Agreements and any Alternative Terms Agreement shall not exceed the Maximum Amount. This Agreement and the Alternative Distribution Agreements are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Distribution Agreements."
     The Company and Deutsche Bank agree as follows:
 
 
     (i) the NYSE Business Day(s) on which the Shares subject to such Agency Transaction are intended to be sold (each, a "Purchase Date");
     (ii) the maximum number of Shares that the Company intends to sell (the "Specified Number of Shares") on, or over the course of, such Purchase
 
Date(s); that the number of Shares sold on each such Purchase Date shall be no more than 25% of the average daily trading volume in the Class A Common Stock for the 30 business days preceding the date of delivery of the Transaction Notice (as communicated to the Company by Deutsche Bank) or as otherwise agreed between the Company and Deutsche Bank; and
provided
     (iii) the lowest price, if any, at which the Company is willing to sell Shares on each such Purchase Date or a formula pursuant to which such lowest price shall be determined (each, a "Floor Price").
     A Transaction Notice shall not set forth a Specified Number of Shares that has an aggregate Gross Sales Price, when added with the Gross Sales Price of the Shares previously purchased and to be purchased pursuant to pending Transaction Notices (if any) hereunder, any Terms Agreement, an Alternative Distribution Agreement and any Alternative Terms Agreement, results in a total Gross Sales Price that exceeds the Maximum Amount.
     Provided that Deutsche Bank confirms to the Company the number of Shares sold in accordance with Section 1(d) above, the Company shall have responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold, or for otherwise monitoring the availability of Shares for sale under the Registration Statement. In the event that more than one Transaction Notice with respect to any Purchase Date(s) is accepted by the Company, the latest executed Transaction Notice shall govern any sales of Shares for the relevant Purchase Date(s), except to the extent of any action occurring pursuant to a prior accepted Transaction Notice and prior to the acceptance of such latest Transaction Notice. The Company or Deutsche Bank may, upon notice to the other party hereto by telephone (confirmed promptly by e-mail or facsimile), suspend the offering of the Shares for any reason; that such suspension or termination shall not affect or impair the parties' respective obligations with respect to the Shares sold hereunder prior to the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms of any Agency Transaction contemplate that Shares shall be sold on more than one Purchase Date, then the Company and Deutsche Bank shall mutually agree to such additional terms and conditions as they deem reasonably necessary in respect of such multiple Purchase Dates, and such additional terms and conditions shall be set forth in the relevant Transaction Notice and be binding to the same extent as any other terms contained therein.
provided, however,
     References herein to this Agreement shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include all Transaction Notices.
 
 
(ii) The terms set forth in a Terms Agreement shall not be binding on the Company or Deutsche Bank unless and until the Company and Deutsche Bank have each executed such Terms Agreement accepting all of the terms of such Terms Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Terms Agreement, the terms of such Terms Agreement shall control.
 
     3. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, Deutsche Bank, on and as of (i) the date hereof, (ii) each date on which the Company and Deutsche Bank agree upon a Transaction Notice (a "Time of Acceptance") or the Company executes and delivers a Terms Agreement, (iii) each Time of Sale (as defined below), (iv) each Settlement Date and (v) each Bring-Down Delivery Date (as defined in Section 6(b)) (each such date listed in (i) through (v), a "Representation Date"), as follows:
Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the Company
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any subsidiary and delivered to Deutsche Bank or to counsel to Deutsche Bank pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to Deutsche Bank as to the matters covered thereby.
