Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "During the second quarter, the housing market experienced an uptick in sales of new homes, compared to the first quarter, as more confident homebuyers took advantage of increased affordability. Declining home prices, historically low interest rates and government stimulus programs, such as the $8,000 federal tax credit and the $10,000 California state tax credit, created unique purchasing opportunities and made it more compelling for homebuyers to enter the market. While we are sensing pent-up demand in the market, rising unemployment, increased foreclosures and tighter credit standards continue to present challenges for the industry to generate sales at a more robust pace and at stabilized pricing. This combined with a recent spike in mortgage rates has made it difficult to predict when the market will ultimately turn the corner."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the second quarter, we strategically focused on further enhancing our liquidity position as we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and a responsible homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio, net of homebuilding cash, of 32.9%. We generated liquidity by reducing our completed, unsold inventory by 53% to 626 homes from 1,321 homes at February 28, 2009. We also issued $400 million of senior notes, retired $281 million of senior notes and generated proceeds of $126 million from the issuance of common stock under an equity draw-down program."
"We continue to focus on returning to profitability. We have made significant progress on right-sizing our business and have aggressively reduced our overhead structure. This was evident by a 510 basis point improvement in S,G&A expenses as a percentage of home sales, compared to the first quarter of 2009. In addition, we have made great strides in lowering our construction costs and repositioning our product offering to target first-time and value-focused homebuyers. More efficient, smaller plans have been very well received by our customers and continue to represent an increased percentage of our deliveries."
Mr. Miller concluded, "As we continue our intense focus on rebuilding homebuilding profitability and on cash generation, we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet to navigate the current market and to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 23% in the second quarter of 2009 to $788.6 million from $1,018.9 million in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 16% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and an 8% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 3,138 homes in the second quarter of 2009 from 3,729 homes last year. In the second quarter of 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $251,000 in the second quarter of 2009 from $274,000 in the same period last year, primarily due to reduced pricing. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $52,600 per home delivered in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $48,700 per home delivered in the same period last year.

Gross margins on home sales were $76.1 million, or 9.6%, in the second quarter of 2009, which included $34.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $88.4 million, or 8.7%, in the second quarter of 2008, which included $73.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments.

Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales as the Company focused on reducing its completed, unsold inventory. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure (please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measure section within this release).
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $44.4 million, or 28%, in the second quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expenses and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.3% in the second quarter of 2009, from 15.4% in 2008.
Gross profits on land sales totaled $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2009, net of $5.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $1.8 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the second quarter of 2008, losses on land sales totaled $5.4 million, which included $2.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $6.6 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $59.9 million in the second quarter of 2009, which included $50.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $18.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, which included $8.0 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is defined by the Company as sales of homes revenue less costs of homes sold excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments recorded during the period. Management finds this to be an important and useful measure in evaluating the Company's performance because it discloses the profit the Company generates on homes it actually delivered during the period, as the Company's SFAS 144 valuation adjustments relate to inventory that it did not deliver during the period. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments also is important to management, because it assists management in making strategic decisions regarding the Company's construction pace, product mix and product pricing based upon the profitability the Company generated on homes it actually delivered during previous periods. The Company believes investors also find gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to be important and useful because it discloses a profitability measure on homes the Company actually delivered in a period that can be compared to the profitability on homes the Company delivered in a prior period without regard to the variability of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments recorded from period to period. In addition, to the extent that the Company's
7-7-7
 
competitors provide similar information, disclosure of the Company's gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare the Company's ability to generate profits with regard to the homes it delivers in a period to its competitors' ability to generate profits with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period.
Although management finds gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. This is because it excludes charges the Company recorded, in accordance with SFAS 144, relating to inventory that was impaired during the period. In addition, because gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded. Management compensates for the limitations of using gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's operations. In order to analyze the Company's overall performance and actual profitability relative to its homebuilding operations, the Company also compares its gross margins on home sales during the period, inclusive of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, with the same measure during prior comparable periods. Due to the limitations discussed above, gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments should not be viewed in isolation as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures of gross margins.
