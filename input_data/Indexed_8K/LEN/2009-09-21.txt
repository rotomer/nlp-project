Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "During the third quarter, the overall housing market continued its road back to recovery as more confident homebuyers took advantage of increased affordability. While high unemployment and foreclosures will continue to present challenges, consumer sentiment has significantly improved as homebuyers have recognized that the residential housing market is stabilizing."
Mr. Miller continued, "We continued to strategically reduce the number of completed, unsold homes and reposition our product to target first-time and value-focused homebuyers. The execution of this strategy has led to an improved selling environment for the Company. While our new orders in the third quarter were down by 8% from the prior year, this is the smallest percentage year over year decline since November 2006. More importantly, our new orders increased sequentially each month during the quarter and we ended the quarter with our highest backlog since August 2008. In order to capitalize on the improvement in our sales pace, we increased our home starts during the quarter, which will lead to higher deliveries in the fourth quarter. We are also encouraged by the continued improvement in our cancellation rate. Additionally, our third quarter results reflect both a sequential improvement in pre-impairment gross margins of 160 basis points, driven by lower construction costs and declining sales incentives, and a $56 million decrease in S,G&A expenses year-over-year as a result of right-sizing our business."
"During the quarter, we generated proceeds of $99 million from the issuance of common stock under an equity draw-down program and ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and a homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio, net of homebuilding cash, of 35.6%. Our ample liquidity enabled us to re-invest in the LandSource joint venture, and our 15% interest should create significant, long-term shareholder value."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Assuming the economy continues to stabilize, we believe our improved sales environment, increasing pre-impairment gross margins and ability to leverage S,G&A should enable us to return to profitability in fiscal 2010."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 36% in the third quarter of 2009 to $635.3 million from $995.7 million in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 28% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 12% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in the third quarter of 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 2,660 homes in the third quarter of 2009 from 3,694 homes last year. In the third quarter of 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $239,000 in the third quarter of 2009 from $270,000 in the same period last year.

Despite a decrease in deliveries during the third quarter of 2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008, interest expense increased primarily due to the interest related to the $400 million of 12.25% senior notes due 2017 issued during the second quarter of 2009 and a reduction in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization as a result of a decrease in inventories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $55.5 million, or 36%, in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expenses and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 15.9% in the third quarter of 2009 and 15.7% in 2008.
Losses on land sales totaled $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, which included $0.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $8.7 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase.

LandSource
In July 2009, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the plan of reorganization for LandSource. As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, LandSource was reorganized into a new company called Newhall Land Development, LLC, ("Newhall"). The reorganized company emerged from Chapter 11 with more than $90 million in cash and free of debt. In addition, as part of the reorganization plan, the Company invested approximately $140 million in exchange for a 15% equity interest in the reorganized Newhall, ownership in several communities that were formerly owned by LandSource and the settlement and release of any claims that might have been asserted against the Company.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
SFAS 109 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. As a result of its net loss during the nine months ended August 31, 2009, the Company generated deferred tax assets of $162.4 million and recorded a non-cash valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS 109 against the entire amount of deferred tax assets generated.
Equity Draw-down Program
As of August 31, 2009, the Company had issued 21.0 million shares of its Class A common stock under the equity draw-down program for gross proceeds of $225.5 million. The Company is authorized to sell shares for up to $275 million under the equity draw-down program.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is defined by the Company as sales of homes revenue less costs of homes sold excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments recorded during the period. Management finds this to be an important and useful measure in evaluating the Company's performance because it discloses the profit the Company generates on homes it actually delivered during the period, as the Company's SFAS 144 valuation adjustments relate to inventory that it did not deliver during the period. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments also is important to management, because it assists management in making strategic decisions regarding the Company's construction pace, product mix and product pricing based upon the profitability the Company generated on homes it actually delivered during previous periods. The Company believes investors also find gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to be important and useful because it discloses a profitability measure on homes the Company actually delivered in a period that can be compared to the profitability on homes the Company delivered in a prior period without regard to the variability of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments recorded from period to period. In addition, to the extent that the Company's competitors provide similar information, disclosure of the Company's gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare the Company's ability to generate profits with regard to the homes it delivers in a period to its competitors' ability to generate profits with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period.
Although management finds gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. This is because it excludes charges the Company recorded, in accordance with SFAS 144, relating to inventory that was impaired during the period. In addition, because gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded. Management compensates for the limitations of using gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's operations. In order to analyze the Company's overall performance and actual
8-8-8
 
profitability relative to its homebuilding operations, the Company also compares its gross margins on home sales during the period, inclusive of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, with the same measure during prior comparable periods. Due to the limitations discussed above, gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments should not be viewed in isolation as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures of gross margins.
