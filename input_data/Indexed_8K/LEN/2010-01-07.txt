The net loss for the year ended November 30, 2009 was $417.1 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1,109.1 million, or $7.00 per diluted share, in 2008.
Miami, January 7, 2010  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "During the fourth quarter, the overall housing market continued to move towards stabilization as more confident homebuyers took advantage of increased affordability and the $8,000 federal tax credit. While we continue to adapt our business in light of the current economic landscape and its challenges, we are optimistic that homebuyers have recognized that the residential housing market is improving and will continue to take advantage of the extended housing stimulus."
Mr. Miller continued, "We continued to focus on the basics of our homebuilding operations, as we strategically position our company to return to profitability in 2010. We experienced the first year-over-year increase in new orders since our first quarter of 2006. Additionally, our fourth quarter results reflected a sequential improvement of 190 basis points in pre-impairment operating margin. This improvement was primarily driven by reduced sales incentives, lower construction costs and the successful rollout of our new value-engineered products."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and a responsible homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio, net of homebuilding cash, of 36.9%. Additionally, as a result of tax legislation that was enacted in our fourth quarter, we will receive a tax refund of approximately $320 million in early 2010. Our improved balance sheet enables us to continue to capitalize on distressed land-buying opportunities, which will improve our operating results in 2010 and beyond."
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $830.2 million from $1,183.1 million in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 22% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 9% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in the fourth quarter of 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 3,488 homes in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 4,484 homes last year. In the fourth quarter of 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $238,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $262,000 in the same period last year. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $36,300 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $51,400 per home delivered in the same period last year, and declined sequentially from $42,200 per home delivered in the third quarter of 2009.

Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments were $147.7 million, or 17.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $200.8 million, or 17.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, improved compared to last year, due primarily to reduced sales incentives as a percentage of revenues from home sales decreasing to 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, from 16.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margins on home sales were $92.2 million, or 11.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $55.5 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $137.4 million, or 11.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $63.4 million of valuation adjustments.

Homebuilding interest expense was $47.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 ($21.9 million was included in cost of homes sold, $4.1 million in cost of land sold and $21.9 million in interest expense), compared to $32.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 ($25.8 million was included in cost of homes sold, $1.1 million in cost of land sold and $5.5 million in interest expense). Despite a decrease in deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, interest expense increased primarily due to the interest related to the $400 million 12.25% senior notes due 2017 issued during the second quarter of 2009, as well as a reduction in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization as a result of a decrease in inventories from prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $32.2 million, or 19%, in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expenses and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, from 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to lower revenues and non recurring lease termination charges and legal expenses.
Losses on land sales totaled $161.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $102.4 million of valuation adjustments (of which $71.6 million related to actual land sales completed during the quarter) and $63.6 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites under option that the Company does not intend to purchase. In the fourth quarter of 2008, losses on land sales totaled $72.5 million, which included $16.7 million of valuation adjustments and $62.9 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites that were under option.
Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $20.9 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included $2.4 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.

Minority interest income (expense), net was $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $13.6 million of minority interest income as a result of a $27.2 million valuation adjustment to inventories of 50%-owned consolidated joint ventures, compared to minority interest income (expense), net of ($4.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, other expense, net and minority interest income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment was $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to an operating loss of $5.4 million in the same period last year. The increase in profitability in the Financial Services segment was primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of successful cost reduction initiatives implemented throughout the downturn.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 8%, in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009, from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower revenues and non recurring lease termination charges.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. As a result of its net operating loss during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company generated deferred tax assets of $106.5 million and recorded a non-cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company recorded a reversal of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $351.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a change in tax legislation, which allowed the Company to carry back its fiscal year 2009 tax loss to recover previously paid income taxes.
Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 33% in the year ended November 30, 2009 to $2.8 billion from $4.2 billion in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 26% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 10% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 11,422 homes in the year ended November 30, 2009 from 15,344 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of the Company's homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008.

Equity Draw-down Program
As of November 30, 2009, the Company had issued 21.0 million shares of its Class A common stock under an equity draw-down program for gross proceeds of $225.5 million. The Company is authorized to sell shares for up to $275 million under the equity draw-down program.
LandSource/Newhall
In July 2009, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the plan of reorganization for LandSource. As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, LandSource was reorganized into a new company called Newhall Land Development, LLC, ("Newhall"). The reorganized company emerged from Chapter 11 with more than $90 million in cash and free of debt. In addition, as part of the reorganization plan, the Company invested approximately $140 million in exchange for a 15% equity interest in the reorganized Newhall, ownership in several communities that were formerly owned by LandSource and the settlement and release of any claims that might have been asserted against the Company.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is defined by the Company as sales of homes revenue less costs of homes sold excluding valuation adjustments recorded during the period. Management finds this to be an important and useful measure in evaluating the Company's performance because it discloses the profit the Company generates on homes it actually delivered during the period, as the Company's valuation adjustments relate to inventory that it did not deliver during the period. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments also is important to management, because it assists management in making strategic decisions regarding the Company's construction pace, product mix and product pricing based upon the profitability the Company generated on homes it actually delivered during previous periods. The Company believes investors also find gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be important and useful because it discloses a profitability measure on homes the Company actually delivered in a period that can be compared to the profitability on homes the Company delivered in a prior period without regard to the variability of valuation adjustments recorded from period to period. In addition, to the extent that the Company's competitors provide similar information, disclosure of the Company's gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare the Company's ability to generate profits with regard to the homes it delivers in a period to its competitors' ability to generate profits with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period.
Although management finds gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. This is because it excludes charges the Company recorded, in accordance with GAAP, relating to inventory that was impaired during the period. In addition, because gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded.
8-8-8
 
Management compensates for the limitations of using gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's operations. In order to analyze the Company's overall performance and actual profitability relative to its homebuilding operations, the Company also compares its gross margins on home sales during the period, inclusive of valuation adjustments, with the same measure during prior comparable periods. Due to the limitations discussed above, gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments should not be viewed in isolation as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures of gross margins.
