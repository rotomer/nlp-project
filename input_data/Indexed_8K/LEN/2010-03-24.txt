, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its first quarter ended February 28, 2010. First quarter net loss in 2010 was $6.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to first quarter net loss of $155.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2009.
Miami, March 24, 2010  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We continue to see that the overall housing market is moving towards stabilization, as more confident homebuyers recognize the increased affordability of homeownership. In the first quarter, this was evidenced by our improved traffic levels, higher backlog, lower cancellation rates and reduced sales incentives."
Mr. Miller continued, "As we strategically position our company to return to profitability in 2010, our core business continues to improve. Our focus on reducing construction costs combined with lower sales incentives led to a 1,270 basis point improvement in gross margin on homes sales to 19.2%. Additionally, our right-sizing of the business resulted in a 360 basis point improvement in S,G&A expenses as a percentage of home sales to 15.8%, compared to last year. This operational focus allowed us to generate a 3.4% operating margin, which is our highest operating margin in four years."
"As the results from our core business have improved and our balance sheet liquidity has strengthened, we are well positioned to invest in new opportunities as noted by our first quarter investments. Our new reportable segment, Rialto Investments, partnered with the FDIC to own portfolios of distressed real estate loans and will manage, work through and add value to these portfolios. Rialto Investments also invested in a fund formed under the Federal government's PPIP, which is focused on acquiring securities backed by real estate loans. In addition to the investments made by our new reportable segment, our homebuilding operations acquired access to well-located homesites through strategic land deals."
"These investments were partially enabled by the NOL carryback legislation signed into law on November 6, 2009. They have enabled us to add jobs and will continue to do so, achieving the desired effect on job creation and the economy which was intended by the NOL carryback legislation included in the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009."
Mr. Miller concluded, "We are on track with our goal to achieve profitability in fiscal 2010. While it is difficult to predict the potential negative impact from the elimination of the federal homebuyer tax credit, we are optimistic that consumer confidence and current affordability will offset this impact over time. We believe that our core business will continue to improve as we deliver homes from our recent strategic land acquisitions and volume levels increase as the recovery of the housing market continues. We are also optimistic that our recent strategic investments entered into by our Rialto Investments segment will create significant long-term value for our shareholders."

Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 2% in the first quarter of 2010 to $513.3 million from $522.8 million in 2009. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 7% decrease in the number of home deliveries excluding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by a 6% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in the first quarter of 2010. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 1,988 homes in the first quarter of 2010 from 2,136 homes last year. In the first quarter of 2010, new home deliveries were lower compared to the first quarter of 2009 in the Company's Homebuilding East and Homebuilding Houston segments, partially offset by an increase in deliveries in the Company's Homebuilding West segment and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $258,000 in the first quarter of 2010 from $244,000 in the same period last year primarily due to an increase in deliveries in the Company's Homebuilding West segment, specifically in California. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of home sales revenue improved to 12.5% in the first quarter of 2010, from 17.1% in the first quarter of 2009.
Gross margins on home sales were $98.4 million, or 19.2%, in the first quarter of 2010, compared to gross margins on home sales of $34.2 million, or 6.5%, in the first quarter of 2009, which included $40.8 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year, primarily due to a reduction in valuation adjustments and reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $20.3 million, or 20%, in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction in fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 15.8% in the first quarter of 2010, from 19.4% in the first quarter of 2009.
Gross profits on land sales totaled $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to losses on land sales of $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2009, which included $0.2 million of valuation adjustments and $10.2 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to homesites that were under option.

Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Other income (expense), net, totaled $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to other income (expense), net, of ($35.8) million in the first quarter of 2009, which included $37.2 million of valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities.
Homebuilding interest expense was $33.2 million in the first quarter of 2010 ($14.3 million was included in cost of homes sold, $0.2 million in cost of land sold and $18.7 million in other interest expense), compared to $17.0 million in the first quarter of 2009 ($4.8 million was included in cost of homes sold, $0.2 million in cost of land sold and $12.0 million in other interest expense). Interest expense increased primarily due to the interest related to the $400 million 12.25% senior notes due 2017 issued during the second quarter of 2009, as well as a reduction in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization as a result of a decrease in inventories from prior year.
Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were ($1.0) million and ($1.7) million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2010 and 2009.
Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, other income (expense), net and net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments.
Lennar Financial Services
Operating loss for the Lennar Financial Services segment was $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to operating earnings of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2009. The current quarter results were slightly lower due to decreased volume in the segment's mortgage and title operations.
Rialto Investments
Lennar's Rialto Investments segment, a new reportable segment, provides advisory services, due-diligence, workout strategies, ongoing asset management services and acquires and monetizes distressed loans and securities portfolios. In February 2010, the Company acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies ("LLCs"), in partnership with the FDIC, for approximately $243 million (net of transactions costs and a $22 million working capital reserve). The FDIC is retaining a 60% interest and is providing $627 million of non-recourse financing at 0% interest. These LLCs have been consolidated on the Company's balance sheet and hold two portfolios of real estate loans with a combined unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion. The transactions include approximately
5-5-5
 
5,500 distressed residential and commercial real estate loans from 22 failed bank receiverships. A subsidiary of the Company, Rialto Capital Advisors, will conduct the day-to-day management and workout of the portfolios.
During the first quarter of 2010, the Company also invested $41 million in a fund formed under the Federal government's PPIP, which is focused on acquiring securities backed by real estate loans.
The Company has grouped these investments, along with an investment in a service and infrastructure provider to the residential home loan market (the "Servicer"), in its Rialto Investments segment.
Operating loss for the Rialto Investments segment was $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to an operating loss of $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, revenues in this segment were $0.3 million, which primarily consisted of fees earned for PPIP advisory services. Revenue recognition related to the LLCs will commence in the second quarter of 2010, as most of the portfolio of real estate loans acquired in partnership with the FDIC had not been transferred from the FDIC's existing servicers prior to the end of the Company's first quarter. During the first quarter of 2010, expenses in this segment were $1.4 million, which consisted of general and administrative expenses primarily related to due-diligence costs and other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the portfolio of real estate loans in partnership with the FDIC. This segment also had net $0.1 million of equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities generated by the PPIP and the Servicer.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $4.8 million, or 18%, in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses decreased to 3.9% in the first quarter of 2010, from 4.6% in the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to reduced professional and personnel costs.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. During the three months ended February 28, 2010, the Company generated deferred tax assets of $2.8 million and recorded a non-cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of deferred tax assets generated.
Termination of the Credit Facility
In February 2010, the Company terminated its $1.1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and it was only being used to issue letters of credit. The Company determined it would be more cost effective to enter into cash-collateralized letter of credit agreements and has entered into such agreements with two banks with a
6-6-6
 
capacity totaling $225 million, of which the Company used $162.7 million as of February 28, 2010. The Company expects to save over $8 million annually as a result of terminating the Credit Facility and entering into more cost effective cash-collateralized letter of credit agreements.
