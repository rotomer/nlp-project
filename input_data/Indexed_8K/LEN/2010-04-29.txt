The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase and accompanying Letter of Transmittal that is being distributed to the holders of the notes.
Miami, April 26, 2010  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
The tender offer is structured in a "waterfall" style, with each of the three issues assigned a priority, and Lennar purchasing all the notes of the highest priority issue, then, to the extent the principal amount of the notes of the highest priority issue that are validly tendered and not withdrawn is less than $200 million, purchasing notes of the second priority issue, and to the extent the total principal amount of the notes of the highest priority issue and the second priority issue that are validly tendered and not withdrawn is less than $200 million, purchasing notes of the third priority issue. If, because of the maximum purchase amount, Lennar will be purchasing only part of the notes of an issue that are tendered, the purchase of notes of that issue will be prorated among the tendering noteholders. Lennar may, in its sole discretion, increase the maximum principal amount of notes it will purchase to more than $200 million.
The tender offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 24, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the tender offer. Payments of the purchase price for the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration time and accepted for purchase will be made promptly after the expiration time. Notes that are validly tendered pursuant to the terms of the tender offer may be withdrawn at any time before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, May 6, 2010 but may not be withdrawn after such time. Holders who validly tender and do not withdraw their notes prior to the early tender time, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, May 6, 2010, will be entitled to receive the full tender offer consideration (which includes an early tender payment). Holders who tender after the early tender date will not be entitled to receive the early tender payment. The full tender consideration that will be paid per $1,000 principal amount of notes of each issue (including the applicable early tender payment) and the priorities among the three issues will be as follows:

You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.
