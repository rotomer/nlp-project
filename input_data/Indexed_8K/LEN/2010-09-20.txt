Miami, September 20, 2010  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "During our third quarter, as expected, our sales pace declined as a result of the expiration of the Federal homebuyer tax credit at the end of April. Although high unemployment and foreclosures have continued to present challenges for the national housing market, our communities have been less impacted than the broader market."

Mr. Miller continued, "In the context of today's market conditions, we have remained focused on improving our core business and are very pleased to report net earnings of $30 million for our third quarter. Our intense focus on fundamentals led to a strong third quarter homebuilding operating margin of 7.2%. In addition, we continued to work with our supply chain to lower construction costs, improve cycle times, and leverage our overhead structure."
"Our Rialto Investments segment continued to add healthy profits to our bottom line as evidenced by its contribution of $7.7 million of operating earnings. Our strategic investments in the FDIC loan portfolios and in the PPIP fund are performing extremely well and are producing strong earnings for our company. Our disciplined approach to underwriting and investing in distressed opportunities holds us in good stead for future earnings growth."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Although challenges still remain in the housing market, we are optimistic that our core businesses are on the right track to achieving sustainable profitability as the housing market recovers."
