Miami, January 11, 2011  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are very pleased to report net earnings of $32 million for our fourth quarter, which despite the challenging housing market, makes it our third consecutive profitable quarter. Our intense focus on construction costs, product re-engineering, and S,G&A reduction all contributed to improved gross and operating margins year over year and a full year of profitability in fiscal 2010."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the fourth quarter, we continued to contract for new, high-margin communities to bolster our profitability in 2011. These strategic land purchases utilize extremely conservative underwriting standards and should generate out-sized returns."
"Our Rialto Investments segment continued to add healthy profits to our bottom line, generating $12.4 million of operating earnings in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition, at a significant discount, of approximately $740 million of distressed real estate assets from three large financial institutions. These acquisitions should create significant long-term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we also completed the first closing of our Rialto real estate investment fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). Through the fund, we will continue to invest in distressed opportunities that will contribute to our future earnings."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Although high unemployment, tight lending standards and low consumer confidence continue to present challenges for the housing industry, we are confident that 2011 will be another profitable year. Our homebuilding segment is on the right track to achieving sustainable profitability and our Rialto Investments segment will enhance our earnings as the housing market stabilizes and ultimately recovers."

Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $725.8 million from $830.2 million in 2009. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 12% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 3,060 homes in the fourth quarter of 2010 from 3,488 homes last year. The average sales price of homes delivered in both the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 was $238,000. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $33,700 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2010, or 12.4% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $36,300 per home delivered in the same period last year, or 13.2% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were $128.7 million, or 17.7%, in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included $22.3 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $92.2 million, or 11.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $55.5 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year primarily due to a reduction in valuation adjustments and reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $32.7 million, or 24%, in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in legal, personnel and occupancy expenses. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010, from 16.2% in 2009.
Gross profits on land sales totaled $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue related to a profit participation agreement. Gross profits on land sales were net of $3.1 million in write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs. Losses on land sales totaled $161.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $102.4 million of valuation adjustments (of which $71.6 million related to actual land sales completed during the fourth quarter of 2009) and $63.6 million in write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs.
