Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 12, 2011, Lennar's Board of Directors promoted Rick Beckwitt to President from Executive Vice President. Stuart Miller will no longer hold the title of President, but will have the title of Chief Executive Officer. The reason for this Form 8-K/A is to clarify that both Mr. Beckwitt's promotion to President and Mr. Miller's ceasing to be the President are subject to, and will become effective upon, approval by the Company's stockholders of proposed amendments to the Company's bylaws.
