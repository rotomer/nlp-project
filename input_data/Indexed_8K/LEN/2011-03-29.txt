Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report EPS of $0.14 for our first fiscal quarter of 2011, making this our fourth consecutive quarter of profitability.

Mr. Miller continued, "During the quarter, we remained focused on the core fundamentals of our business, generating profitable results in each of our business segments. Our homebuilding segment continued to produce strong gross margins, benefiting from our intense focus on controlling construction costs and opening new high margin communities. Although S,G&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from home sales, they continued to decline in absolute dollars. Our Rialto segment continued to produce healthy profits, generating $11.0 million of operating earnings in the first quarter."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Our strong balance sheet and significant liquidity puts us in an excellent position to purchase new strategic high margin land deals for our homebuilding business and distressed opportunities for our Rialto business. While it is unclear whether the spring selling season will gain momentum or continue its sluggish recovery, we are confident that our company is well positioned for a profitable year in 2011."
Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2011 to $457.9 million from $513.3 million in 2010. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered and 4% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 1,903 homes in the first quarter of 2011 from 1,988 homes last year. There was a decrease in home deliveries in Homebuilding Other and all of the Company's Homebuilding segments except for the Company's Homebuilding East segment. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $240,000 in the first quarter of 2011, primarily in the Company's Homebuilding West segment, from $258,000 in the same period last year. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $33,100 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2011, or 12.1% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $37,100 per home delivered in the same period last year, or 12.5% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were $91.7 million, or 20.0%, in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $98.4 million, or 19.2%, in the first quarter of 2010. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year, primarily due to reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales. Gross profits on land sales totaled $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2010.
