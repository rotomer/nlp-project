, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, today reported results for its second quarter ended May 31, 2011. Second quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2011 were $13.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to second quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar of $39.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in 2010.
Miami, June 23, 2011  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report EPS of $0.07 for our second fiscal quarter of 2011. Despite operating in a challenging housing market that saw very little evidence of a spring selling season, we were still able to achieve strong results, making this our fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. Our new orders during the quarter were flat with last year notwithstanding the elevated level of sales in March and April of the prior year due to the Federal homebuyer tax credit. For the month of May, new orders were up over 30%, while new orders declined approximately 11% in the prior two months. Given that the housing stimulus tax credit was eliminated in May 2010, we should experience favorable year-over-year comparisons going forward."
Mr. Miller continued, "During the quarter, we continued to focus on the basics of our core homebuilding business. We benefitted greatly from our strategic capital investments in new high margin communities, which helped produce one of the highest gross margins in the industry. Our homebuilding operations were also driven by the reinvigoration of our Everything's Included marketing platform and by our continued focus on reducing construction costs and controlling overhead."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Our strong balance sheet and liquidity will allow us to continue to purchase new strategic high margin land deals for our homebuilding business and distressed opportunities for our Rialto business. Given current market conditions, we remain confident that our company is well positioned for a profitable year in 2011."
Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales decreased 6% in the second quarter of 2011 to $649.8 million from $694.8 million in 2010. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 9% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by a 2% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 2,652 homes in the second quarter of 2011 from 2,902 homes last year. There was a decrease in home deliveries in Homebuilding Other and all of the Company's Homebuilding segments except for the Company's Homebuilding East segment.

Lennar Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment was $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared to operating earnings of $13.7 million in the same period last year.
