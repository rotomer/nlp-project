Miami, January 11, 2012  Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to report EPS of $0.16 for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. Despite operating in a challenging real estate market, we achieved profitability in all of our business segments."
"During the quarter, we continued to manage our homebuilding business carefully with tight controls over our costs and a focus on improving our gross margins. We benefited greatly from our strategic capital investments in new higher margin communities, which helped us produce a 21.6% gross margin, excluding valuation adjustments, in the fourth quarter."
Mr. Miller continued, "As we come to the end of 2011 and head into 2012, we have seen the market start to stabilize, driven by a combination of low home prices and low interest rates, making the decision to purchase a new home more attractive, compared to the heated rental market. These factors are reflected in our new orders and sales backlog, which increased 20% and 35%, respectively, from the prior year quarter."
"On the Rialto side of our business, our first real estate fund successfully raised $700 million and is now contributing management fees and investment income to our bottom line results. We continue to see significant opportunities to invest in distressed assets for our Rialto business."
Mr. Miller concluded, "Our balance sheet strength will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities as they present themselves, and we believe that our Homebuilding and Rialto segments are well positioned to lead the way to a third consecutive profitable year in 2012."

Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $816.5 million from $725.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 10% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities and a 2% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 3,359 homes in the fourth quarter of 2011 from 3,060 homes last year. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $243,000 in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $238,000 in the same period last year. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $33,900 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2011, or 12.2% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $33,700 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2010, or 12.4% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were $158.4 million, or 19.4%, in the fourth quarter of 2011, which included $17.9 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $128.7 million, or 17.7%, in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included $22.3 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year primarily due to a reduction in valuation adjustments.
Gross profits on land sales totaled $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, net of $0.4 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs, compared to gross profits on land sales of $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included a $14.1 million reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement, partially offset by $3.1 million in write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs.

This was offset by a pre-tax gain of $62.3 million included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, related to that unconsolidated entity's net asset distribution. The transaction resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $4.7 million. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Lennar Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment was $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to operating earnings of $11.7 million in the same period last year. The decrease in profitability was due primarily to decreased volume in the segment's mortgage operations.

("AB") fund formed under the Federal government's Public-Private Investment Program ("PPIP"), partially offset by interest income earned by the AB PPIP fund and equity in earnings related to the Rialto Investments Real Estate Fund. This compares to equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of $9.0 million in the same period last year, which included $4.7 million of unrealized gains related to the Company's share of the mark-to-market adjustments of AB PPIP investments. In the fourth quarter of 2011, expenses in this segment were $38.4 million, which consisted primarily of costs related to its portfolio operations, due diligence expenses related to both completed and abandoned transactions, and other general and administrative expenses, compared to expenses of $20.8 million in the same period last year.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2010 was primarily related to net earnings attributable to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC, partially offset by net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the Company's homebuilding operations.
Change in Reportable Segments
The Company has disaggregated its Southeast Florida homebuilding division from its Homebuilding East reportable segment and has presented Homebuilding Southeast Florida as a separate reportable segment due to the division currently achieving one of the quantitative thresholds set forth in Accounting Standard Codification Topic 280, , ("ASC 280"). In addition, the Company reclassified the homebuilding activities in the states of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina from Homebuilding Other to the Homebuilding East reportable segment because these states currently meet the reportable segment aggregation criteria in ASC 280. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the quarterly and fiscal year 2011 presentation, and have no effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for such periods.
