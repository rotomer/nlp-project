Administrative Agent
Credit Agreement
WHEREAS, the Borrower and each of the Guarantors are members of the same consolidated group of companies and are engaged in operations which require financing on a basis in which credit can be made available from time to time to the Borrower, and the Guarantors will derive direct and indirect economic benefit from the Loans, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement;
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Lenders to make Loans, Swingline Loans and issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement that the Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty; and
WHEREAS, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the beneficiaries of each indemnification obligation undertaken by any Loan Party under any Loan Document are herein referred to as the "Guarantied Parties";
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and to induce the Lenders to make Loans, Swingline Loans and issue Letters of Credit, the Guarantors hereby agree as follows:
The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full and prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of (a) the Obligations, whether now or hereafter existing and whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, (b) any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses and reasonable counsel fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) incurred by any of the Guarantied Parties in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty and (c) all present and future amounts that would become due but for the operation of any provision of bankruptcy or insolvency laws, and all present and future accrued and unpaid interest, including, without limitation, all post-petition interest if the Borrower or any Guarantor voluntarily or involuntarily becomes subject to any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency law (a "") (the items set forth in clauses (a), (b) and (c) immediately above being herein referred to as the "

Upon failure of the Borrower to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when due after the expiration of any applicable notice and/or cure period in each case provided for in the Loan Documents (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), the Guarantors hereby further jointly and severally agree to promptly pay the same after the Guarantors' receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of the Borrower's failure to pay the same, without any other demand or notice whatsoever, including without limitation, any notice having been given to any Guarantor of either the acceptance by the Guarantied Parties of this Guaranty or the creation or incurrence of any of the Obligations.

(c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on any collateral for, or any release of any other Loan Party or amendment or waiver of any term of any other guaranty of, or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other guaranty of, all or any of the Guarantied Obligations;
(d) the absence of any attempt to collect any of the Guarantied Obligations from the Borrower or from any other Loan Party or any other action to enforce the same or the election of any remedy by any of the Guarantied Parties;
(e) any waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence by any of the Guarantied Parties with respect to any provision of any other Loan Document;
(f) the election by any of the Guarantied Parties in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
(g) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by the Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, under any Debtor Relief Law; or
(h) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Borrower or any Guarantor other than payment or performance of the Obligations.
SECTION 3. Waiver.
(a) Each Guarantor hereby (i) waives (A) promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any and all other notices, including, without limitation, notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration, with respect to any of the Obligations or this Guaranty, (B) any requirement that any of the Guarantied Parties protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral, (C) the filing of any claim with a court in the event of receivership or bankruptcy of the Borrower or any other Person, (D) except as otherwise provided herein, protest or notice with respect to nonpayment of all or any of the Guarantied Obligations, (E) the benefit of any statute of limitations (other than any statute of limitations that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Borrower is entitled to rely on with respect to its obligations under the Loan Documents), (F) all demands whatsoever (and any requirement that demand be made on the Borrower or any other Person as a condition precedent to such Guarantor's obligations hereunder), (G) all rights by which any Guarantor might be entitled to require suit on an accrued right of action in respect of any of the Guarantied Obligations or require suit against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or Person, (H) any defense based upon an election of remedies by any Guarantied Party, or (I) notice of any events or circumstances set forth in clauses (a) through (h) of Section 2 hereof; and (ii) covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise agreed by the parties, this Guaranty will not be discharged except (A) by complete payment of the Guarantied Obligations and any other obligations of such Guarantor contained herein or (B) as to any Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor as permitted under Section 6.7 of the Credit Agreement.
(b) If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, any of the Guarantied Parties shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including, without limitation, its right to enter a deficiency judgment against the Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable law pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Guarantor hereby consents to such action by such Guarantied Party and waives any claim based upon such action. Any election of remedies which results in the denial or impairment of the right of such Guarantied Party to seek a deficiency judgment against the Borrower shall not impair the obligation of such Guarantor to pay the full amount of the Guarantied Obligations or any other obligation of such Guarantor contained herein.
(c) In the event any of the Guarantied Parties shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law, under any of the Loan Documents, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, such Guarantied Party may bid all or less than the amount of the Guarantied Obligations and the amount of such bid, if successful, need not be paid by such Guarantied Party but shall be credited against the Guarantied Obligations.
(d) Each Guarantor agrees that notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting the generality of the foregoing if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Guarantied Parties are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of the Guarantied Obligations, to collect interest on the Guarantied Obligations, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, or the Administrative Agent is prevented from taking any action to realize on any collateral, such Guarantor agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Guarantied Parties, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Guarantied Parties.
(e) Each Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrower and of each other Loan Party, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that the Guarantied Parties shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to any of the Guarantied Parties regarding such condition or any such circumstance. In the event that any of the Guarantied Parties in its sole discretion undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any Guarantor, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (ii) to disclose any information which, pursuant to accepted or reasonable banking or commercial finance practices, such Guarantied Party wishes to maintain as confidential, or (iii) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to such Guarantor.
(f) Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Guarantied Parties shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Guarantor or otherwise in connection with obtaining payment of any or all of the Guarantied Obligations from any Person or source.
No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by any Guarantor herefrom shall in any event be effective
SECTION 4. Amendments, Etc.
unless the same shall be in writing, approved by the Required Lenders (or by all the Lenders where the approval of each Lender is required under the Credit Agreement) and signed by the Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be effectuated in the manner provided for in Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement, provided that if a notice or communication hereunder is sent to a Guarantor, said notice shall be addressed to such Guarantor, in care of the Borrower.
SECTION 5. Addresses for Notices.
SECTION 6. No Waiver; Remedies.
(a) No failure on the part of any Guarantied Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by applicable law, any of the other Loan Documents.
(b) No waiver by the Guarantied Parties of any Default shall operate as a waiver of any other Default or the same Default on a future occasion, and no action by any of the Guarantied Parties permitted hereunder shall in way affect or impair any of the rights of the Guarantied Parties or the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, under any of the other Loan Documents, except as specifically set forth in any such waiver. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any principal and/or interest or other amount constituting any of the Guarantied Obligations shall be conclusive and binding on each Guarantor irrespective of whether such Guarantor was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made provided that the Borrower was so a party.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, each of the Guarantied Parties is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Guarantied Party to or for the credit or the account of each Guarantor against any and all of the Guarantied Obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty, irrespective of whether or not such Guarantied Party shall have made any demand under this Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured; provided, however, such Guarantied Party shall promptly notify such Guarantor and the Borrower after such set-off and the application made by such Guarantied Party. The rights of each Guarantied Party under this Section 7 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Guarantied Party may have.
SECTION 7. Right of Set-off.
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all of the Obligations, return or cancellation of all outstanding Letters of Credit and termination of the Commitments (the "") (ii) be binding upon each Guarantor, its permitted successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Guarantied Parties and their

respective successors, permitted transferees, and permitted assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), each of the Guarantied Parties may assign or otherwise transfer any Note held by it or the Guarantied Obligations owed to it to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Guarantied Party herein or otherwise with respect to such of the Notes and the Guarantied Obligations so transferred or assigned, subject, however, to compliance with the provisions of Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement in respect of assignments. No Guarantor may assign any of its obligations under this Guaranty without first obtaining the written consent of the Lenders as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the continuation provisions set forth above shall not apply to any Guarantor that is released from the Guaranty in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 6.7 of the Credit Agreement.
To the extent that any Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay a portion of the Guarantied Obligations exceeding the greater of (a) the amount of the economic benefit actually received by such Guarantor from the Loans and the Letters of Credit and (b) the amount such Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations (excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Borrower) in the same proportion as such Guarantor's net worth at the date enforcement is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors at the date enforcement is sought hereunder, then such Guarantor shall be reimbursed by such other Guarantors for the amount of such excess, pro rata, based on the respective net worths of such other Guarantors at the date enforcement hereunder is sought. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantied Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing its guaranty herein or effecting the rights and remedies of the Guarantied Parties hereunder. This Section 9 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 9 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay to the Guarantied Parties the Guarantied Obligations as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof.
SECTION 9. Reimbursement.
This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against any Loan Party for liquidation or reorganization, should any Loan Party become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of any Loan Party's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligees of the Obligations or such part thereof, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Guarantied Obligations shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
SECTION 10. Reinstatement.
