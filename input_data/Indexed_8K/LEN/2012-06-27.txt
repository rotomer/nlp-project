FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Lennar Reports Second Quarter EPS of
$2.06
(more)
2-2-2
Miami, June 27, 2012 -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
,
one of
the nations largest homebuilders, today reported results for its second quarter ended
May 31, 2012
. Second quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in
2012
were
$452.7 million
, or
$2.06
per diluted share, compared to second quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar of
$13.8 million
, or
$0.07
per diluted share, in 2011.
Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, We are pleased to announce EPS of $2.06 in the second quarter, consisting of $0.21 per share related to our improving fundamental business and $1.85 per share related to the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. These results mark our ninth consecutive quarter of profitability.
Evidence from the field suggests that the 'for sale' housing market has, in fact, bottomed and that we have commenced a slow and steady recovery process. And while the housing downturn was broad-based and national, the recovery process continues to be very localized. Although highly conservative mortgage lending practices and challenging appraisals remain a constant headwind, we are experiencing net positive price and volume trends in most of our markets.
Mr. Miller continued, As the overall housing market has continued to improve over the last several quarters, our well located communities and product execution has allowed us to outperform the market. During the quarter, deliveries increased 20%, new orders increased 40%, backlog increased 61% and our operating margin increased over 100% to 9.2%, our highest margin percentage since Q2 2006. This operating leverage was driven by our ability to increase sales per community, raise prices and lower incentives, and control our overhead costs.
During the quarter, we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets amounting to
$403 million
. This conclusion was based on an extremely detailed evaluation by our management team and reviewed by our independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche. The evaluation consisted of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative, including such factors as nine consecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued profitability, as well as the improved housing market.
Mr. Miller concluded, Looking ahead, our strong balance sheet and significant liquidity, which was enhanced this quarter by our new $525 million unsecured revolving credit facility, continue to position us to capitalize on future strategic opportunities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2012 COMPARED TO
THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2011
Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased
23%
in the second quarter of 2012 to
$796.4 million
from
$649.8 million
in 2011. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 20% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 2% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to
3,192
homes in the second quarter of 2012 from 2,652 homes last year. There was an increase in home deliveries in all the Company's Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $250,000 in the second quarter of 2012 from $245,000 in the same period last year. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were
$29,800
per home delivered in the second quarter of 2012, or
10.7%
as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to
$33,900
per home delivered in the same period last year, or
12.1%
as a percentage of home sales revenue, and $34,200 per home delivered in the first quarter of 2012, or 12.2% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were
$179.0 million
, or
22.5%
, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to
$125.7 million
, or
19.4%
, in the second quarter of 2011. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year, primarily due to a greater percentage of deliveries from the Company's new higher margin communities, a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenue from home sales, an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and lower valuation adjustments. Gross profits on land sales totaled
$2.7 million
in the second quarter of 2012, compared to
$2.9 million
in the second quarter of 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were
$105.4 million
in the second quarter of 2012, compared to
$96.9 million
in the second quarter of 2011. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to
13.2%
in the second quarter of 2012, from
14.9%
in the second quarter of 2011, due to improved operating leverage.
Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was (
$9.4
) million in the second quarter of 2012, which included
$5.4 million
of valuation adjustments related to asset sales at Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities, compared to Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) of
$2.4 million
in the second quarter of 2011.
Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled
$12.8 million
in the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to a $15.0 million gain on the sale of an operating property, compared to Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, of
$9.5 million
in the second quarter of 2011, of which $5.1 million related to the favorable resolution of a joint venture.
4-4-4
Homebuilding interest expense was
$44.8 million
in the second quarter of 2012 (
$20.4 million
was included in cost of homes sold,
$0.6 million
in cost of land sold and
$23.8 million
in other interest expense), compared to
$41.5 million
in the second quarter of 2011 (
$18.5 million
was included in cost of homes sold,
$0.5 million
in cost of land sold and
$22.5 million
in other interest expense). Interest expense increased due to an increase in the Company's outstanding debt compared to the same period last year.
Lennar Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were
$18.0 million
in the second quarter of 2012, compared to
$2.5 million
in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in profitability was primarily due to increased volume and margins in the segment's mortgage operations and increased volume in the segment's title operations.
Rialto Investments
In the second quarter of 2012, operating earnings for the Rialto Investments segment were $4.3 million, or
$7.5 million
(which included $3.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings of $9.8 million, or
$22.7 million
(which included $12.9 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2012, revenues in this segment were
$33.5 million
, which consisted primarily of accretable interest income associated with the segments portfolio of real estate loans and fees for managing and servicing assets, compared to revenues of
$42.6 million
in the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2012, Rialto Investments other income (expense), net, was (
$1.4
) million, which consisted primarily of expenses related to owning and maintaining real estate owned ("REO") and impairments on REO, partially offset by gains from sales of REO and rental income. In the second quarter of 2011, Rialto Investments other income (expense), net was
$15.3 million
, which consisted primarily of gains from acquisition of REO through foreclosure and a $4.7 million gain on the sale of investment securities.
The segment also had equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of
$5.6 million
during the second quarter of 2012, which primarily included $2.5 million of interest income earned by the AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) fund formed under the Federal governments Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) and $3.0 million of equity in earnings related to the Company's share of earnings from the Rialto Investments Real Estate Fund (the Fund). This compares to equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of (
$3.0
) million in the second quarter of 2011, which included ($4.8) million of net losses primarily related to unrealized losses for the Company's share of the mark-to-market adjustments of the investment portfolio underlying the AB PPIP fund, partially offset by $2.6 million of interest income earned by the AB PPIP fund. In the second quarter of 2012, expenses in this segment were
$30.2 million
, which consisted primarily of costs related to its portfolio operations, due diligence expenses related to both completed and abandoned transactions, and other general and administrative expenses, compared to expenses of
$32.3 million
in the same period last year.
5-5-5
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were
$29.2 million
, or
3.1%
as a percentage of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to
$20.6 million
, or
2.7%
as a percentage of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses as a result of an increase in share-based and variable compensation expense.
Noncontrolling Interests
Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were
$1.7 million
and
$11.1 million
, respectively, in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the second quarter of 2012 and 2011 were primarily related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC, partially offset by a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Company's homebuilding operations.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
During the second quarter of 2012, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets would be utilized. This conclusion was based on a detailed evaluation of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative, including such factors as nine consecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued profitability and signs of recovery in the housing markets the Company operates in. Accordingly, the Company reversed
$403.0 million
of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. After the reversal, the Company had a valuation allowance of
$177.3 million
against its deferred tax assets as of May 31, 2012, most of which is expected to reverse between the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013 once additional sufficient positive evidence is present indicating that it is more likely than not that such assets would be realized.
Revolving Credit Facility
In May 2012, the Company entered into a 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with certain financial institutions that expires in May 2015. The maximum aggregate commitment under the Credit Facility is $525 million, of which $410 million is committed and $115 million is available through an accordion feature, subject to additional commitments.

5,664
homes in the
six months ended May 31, 2012

of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities.

, primarily due to a $15.0 million gain on the sale of an operating property, compared to Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, of
$39.5 million
in the
six months ended May 31, 2011
, which included $29.5 million related to the receipt of a litigation settlement, $5.1 million related to the favorable resolution of a joint venture and the recognition of
$10.0 million
of deferred management fees related to management services previously performed for one of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities. These amounts were partially offset by

.
