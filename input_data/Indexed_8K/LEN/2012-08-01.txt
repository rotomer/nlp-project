On July 31, 2012, the Company paid for $204.7 million principal amount of its 5.95% Senior Notes due 2013 ("5.95% Senior Notes"), which were validly tendered by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 30, 2012, in response to the Company's offer to purchase any and all of the 5.95% Senior Notes for 103% of their principal amount with regard to the 5.95% Senior Notes that were tendered by or before that time, and for 102% of their principal amount with regard to the 5.95% Senior Notes that are tendered after that time but before the offer expires.
The purchase price for the 5.95% Senior Notes that were tendered by or before 5:00 p.m. on July 30, 2012 includes an early tendered payment of $10 per $1,000 principal amount that will not be paid for the 5.95% Senior Notes that are tendered after that time. The Company's obligation to purchase tendered 5.95% Senior Notes had been conditioned upon completion of a sale of at least $300 million principal amount of a new issue of Senior Notes due 2017. That condition was satisfied by a sale of $350 million principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2017 on July 20, 2012.
A total of $63.0 million principal amount of 5.95% Senior Notes are still outstanding. The Company will accept and purchase all the remaining 5.95% Senior Notes that are validly tendered after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 30, 2012 and before the offer expires, which will occur at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on August 14, 2012, unless the Company extends the offer. It will pay for those 5.95% Senior Notes shortly after the offer expires. Tenders of 5.95% Senior Notes after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 30, 2012 may not be withdrawn.

Some of the statements in this press release are "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual events or transaction terms to differ materially from the events and transaction terms anticipated in forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws.
