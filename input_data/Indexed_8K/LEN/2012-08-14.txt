Some of the statements in this press release are "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual events or transaction terms to differ materially from the events and transaction terms anticipated in forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws.
