(more)
2-2-2
Miami, September 24, 2012 -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B)
,
one of
the nations largest homebuilders, today reported results for its third quarter ended
August 31, 2012
. Third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in
2012
were
$87.1 million
, or
$0.40
per diluted share, compared to third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar of
$20.7 million
, or
$0.11
per diluted share, in 2011.
Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, The housing market has stabilized and the recovery is well underway. Low mortgage rates, affordable home prices, increased buyer confidence and an extremely favorable rent-to-own comparison are driving growth in each of our markets. Additionally, reduced foreclosures and declining distressed home inventory are further contributing to the improvement in the housing market.
Our third quarter reflects solid profitability in all of our business segments. In homebuilding, we continue to see strong sales trends translating into increased deliveries, stronger gross margins and improved operating leverage. While materials and labor costs are moving higher, sales price increases and incentive reductions should continue to offset the impact of increasing costs. In addition, we will continue to benefit from our opportunistic land acquisitions.
Mr. Miller continued, Our financial services group has continued to derive earnings from our expanding homebuilding platform and by participating in the robust refinancing market. We are now starting to see great operating leverage in this business as well.
Rialto has continued to contribute directly to the profitability of the company while providing our homebuilding segment with new opportunities to acquire attractive land parcels. Additionally, Rialto has benefitted from the unwinding of our PPIP program which has driven profitability and has recycled cash back to the company.
Mr. Miller concluded, Overall, our third quarter reflects excellent overall results and strengthens the financial position of our company, as we grow volume and drive profitability in a recovering market.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2012 COMPARED TO
THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2011
Lennar Homebuilding
Revenues from home sales increased
33%
in the third quarter of 2012 to
$932.8 million
from
$700.6 million
in 2011. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 28% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to
3,617
homes in the third quarter of 2012 from
2,832
homes last year. There was an increase in home deliveries in all the Company's Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $258,000 in the third quarter of 2012 from $247,000 in the same period last year. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were
$26,100
per home delivered in the third quarter of 2012, or
9.2%
as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to
$33,600
per home delivered in the same period last year, or
12.0%
as a percentage of home sales revenue, and $
29,800
per home delivered in the second quarter of 2012, or
10.7%
as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were
$216.2 million
, or
23.2%
, in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
$147.6 million
, or
21.1%
, in the third quarter of 2011, which included a 120 basis point benefit related to changes in the Company's cost-to-complete estimates for homebuilding communities in the close-out phase. This benefit primarily impacted the Company's Homebuilding West segment and was offset by valuation adjustments that impacted the gross margin percentage by 130 basis points in the third quarter of 2011. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year, primarily due to a greater percentage of deliveries from the Company's new higher margin communities, a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenue from home sales, an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and lower valuation adjustments. Gross profits on land sales totaled
$1.3 million
in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
$1.5 million
in the third quarter of 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were
$112.2 million
in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
$100.3 million
in the third quarter of 2011. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to
12.0%
in the third quarter of 2012, from
14.3%
in the third quarter of 2011, due to improved operating leverage.
Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was (
$6.0
) million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily related to the Company's share of operating losses of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, compared to Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) of
($4.6) million
in the third quarter of 2011.
4-4-4
Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled
($5.4) million
in the third quarter of 2012, which included a pre-tax loss of
$6.5 million
related to the repurchase of
$204.7 million
aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due 2013 through a tender offer, compared to Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, of
$6.9 million
in the third quarter of 2011, net of $2.1 million of valuation adjustments to the Company's investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.
Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was
$45.0 million
in the third quarter of 2012 (
$21.9 million
was included in cost of homes sold,
$0.4 million
in cost of land sold and
$22.7 million
in other interest expense), compared to
$42.4 million
in the third quarter of 2011 (
$17.8 million
was included in cost of homes sold,
$0.5 million
in cost of land sold and
$24.1 million
in other interest expense). Interest expense increased due to an increase in the Company's outstanding debt compared to the same period last year.
Lennar Financial Services
Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were
$25.3 million
in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
$8.0 million
in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in profitability was primarily due to increased volume and margins in the segment's mortgage operations and increased volume in the segment's title operations, as a result of an increase in refinance transactions and homebuilding deliveries.
Rialto Investments
In the third quarter of 2012, operating earnings (loss) for the Rialto Investments segment were $7.7 million (which is comprised of a
$5.7 million
operating loss and an add back of $13.4 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings (loss) of $5.7 million (which included
$11.7 million
of operating earnings offset by $6.1 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2012, revenues in this segment were
$37.2 million
, which consisted primarily of accretable interest income associated with the segments portfolio of real estate loans and fees for managing and servicing assets, including $8.1 million in fees earned from Rialto's role as sub-advisor to the AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) fund formed under the Federal governments Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), compared to revenues of
$42.1 million
in the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2012, Rialto Investments other income (expense), net, was (
$10.1
) million, which consisted primarily of expenses related to owning and maintaining real estate owned ("REO") and impairments on REO, partially offset by gains from sales of REO and rental income. In the third quarter of 2011, Rialto Investments other income (expense), net, was
$9.7 million
, which consisted primarily of gains from acquisition of REO through foreclosure, as well as gains from sales of REO, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining REO.
The segment also had equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of
$13.6 million
during the third quarter of 2012, which included $8.1 million of net gains primarily related to realized gains from the sale of investments in the portfolio underlying the AB PPIP fund, $1.2 million of interest income earned by the AB PPIP fund and $6.2 million of equity in earnings related to the Company's share of earnings from the Rialto Real Estate Fund (the Fund). This compared to equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of (
$6.5
) million in the third quarter of 2011, which included $10.2 million of net losses primarily related to
5-5-5
unrealized losses for the Company's share of the mark-to-market adjustments of the investment portfolio underlying the AB PPIP fund, partially offset by $2.8 million of interest income earned by the AB PPIP fund. In the third quarter of 2012, expenses in this segment were
$46.4 million
, which consisted primarily of costs related to its portfolio operations, loan impairments of $20.3 million primarily associated with the segment's FDIC loan portfolio (before noncontrolling interests) and other general and administrative expenses, compared to expenses of
$33.6 million
in the same period last year.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate general and administrative expenses were
$32.3 million
, or
2.9%
as a percentage of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2012, compared to
$22.8 million
, or
2.8%
as a percentage of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses as a result of an increase in share-based and variable compensation expense.
Noncontrolling Interests
Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were
($15.7) million
and
$2.8 million
, respectively, in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the third quarter of 2012 was primarily related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the third quarter of 2011 were related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC, partially offset by a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Company's homebuilding operations.
Income Taxes
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of its state deferred tax assets would be utilized. This conclusion was based on additional positive evidence including actual and forecasted earnings. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2012, the Company reversed $35.4 million of its valuation allowance against its state deferred tax assets and $8.6 million of its valuation allowance that was previously maintained to be utilized in remaining interim periods of 2012. The total reversal for the third quarter of 2012 was
$44.0 million
. This reversal was offset by a tax provision of
$31.2 million
primarily related to third quarter 2012 pre-tax earnings. Therefore, the Company had a
$12.8 million
net benefit for income taxes for the third quarter of 2012.
Debt Transactions
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued
$400 million
of
4.75%
senior notes due 2017 in a private offering under SEC Rule 144A. The Company used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase
$204.7 million
aggregate principal amount of its 5.95% senior notes due 2013 through a tender offer and the remainder of the proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
