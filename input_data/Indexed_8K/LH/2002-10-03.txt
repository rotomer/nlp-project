UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 October 3, 2002 - ------------------ (Date of earliest event reported) LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS - ------------------------------------------ (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) DELAWARE 1-11353 13-3757370 -------------- ----------- -------------- (State or other (Commission (IRS Employer jurisdiction of File Number) Identification incorporation) Number) 358 SOUTH MAIN STREET, BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA 27215 - ------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) 336-229-1127 - ------------ (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. Laboratory Corporation of America-Registered Trademark- Holdings (LabCorp-Registered Trademark-) (NYSE: LH) today announced, based on a preliminary projection of third quarter results, that it expects revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, to be in the range of $650 to $655 million, an increase of approximately 16 percent compared to third quarter 2001. This forecast represents an increase of approximately 14.5 percent on a per day basis, which is 2 percent lower than LabCorp had previously anticipated. The Thomson Financial First Call consensus revenue estimate for the third quarter of 2002 is $664.2 million. LabCorp said that the less than anticipated quarterly revenue growth is directly related to a continued slowdown in volume growth in the routine, or core, testing business in certain key regions of the country. LabCorp noted, based upon its preliminary review, that testing volume growth in its strategically important genomics business continued to be strong. The Company also emphasized that it remains committed to its strategic plan focusing on genomic testing, and continues to be optimistic about its prospects for overall growth and profitability. As a result of the revised revenue estimates, the Company expects that third quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) will now be approximately 10 percent lower than the First Call consensus estimate of $0.49. Although LabCorp has implemented a series of programs to increase revenue growth in the regions affected, it believes this trend will most likely continue throughout the fourth quarter and, accordingly, will provide updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002 during its quarterly earnings call scheduled for October 31, 2002 at 9 a.m. (Eastern Time). The Company also indicated that the integration of Dynacare Inc. is progressing on schedule with synergy savings developing as anticipated, and that cash collections in the quarter remained strong. During the quarter, the Company repaid $30 million of its $150 million bridge loan and fully repaid the $50 million revolver loan used to finance its July acquisition of Dynacare. LabCorp will report third quarter results after markets close on October 30, 2002. A live broadcast of LabCorp's quarterly conference call on October 31, 2002 will be available online at www.labcorp.com or at www.streetevents.com beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, with an online rebroadcast continuing through December 1, 2002.
