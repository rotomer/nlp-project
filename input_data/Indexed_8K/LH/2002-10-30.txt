Third Quarter Results: Revenues in the third quarter were $655.2 million, an increase of 16.8 percent compared to the same period in 2001, and reflect the acquisition of Dynacare Inc. on July 25, 2002. Testing volume, measured by accessions, increased 13.2 percent compared to the prior year, or 4.3 percent on a pro forma basis, assuming that Dynacare had been part of LabCorp since January 1, 2001. Price per accession increased 3.6 percent compared to third quarter 2001. Net income for the quarter increased to $67.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to 2001 third quarter net income of $51.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, before special items in both periods and adjusted for the required change in goodwill accounting (SFAS 142) and the special items. The special items relate to a $17.5 million pre-tax restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter of 2002 in connection with the integration of Dynacare, which contributed to an earnings loss of $0.07 per share, and an extraordinary item and one-time charge in the third quarter of 2001 relating to early extinguishment of debt.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $145.9 million for the third quarter, or 22.3 percent of net sales, compared to $125.3 million, or 22.3 percent of net sales, for the same period in 2001, adjusted for the special items. Bad debt expense improved to 8.4 percent of sales and days sales outstanding were 56 days. During the quarter, the company repaid $80 million of the $200 million in debt borrowed on July 25 in connection with the acquisition of Dynacare. Operating cash flow was $121.1 million and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $98.4 million. "Our results continue to demonstrate high quality of earnings, with solid revenue growth, substantial EBITDA margins and strong cash generation," said Thomas P. Mac Mahon, chairman and chief executive officer. "Since the end of July, we have made excellent progress in integrating Dynacare. The integration process is ahead of schedule, with significant growth opportunities expected in selected U.S. markets." "Additionally, LabCorp continues to concentrate on further expanding its offering of genomic tests, with volume growth in this segment exceeding 20 percent, " noted Mr. Mac Mahon. "Over the past several years, we have demonstrated that LabCorp's genomic strategy to build upon it's capabilities in this arena is fundamentally sound. This strategy remains our cornerstone for long-term revenue growth, and we expect to offer many more important genomic tests in coming years. Recently, we announced an exclusive agreement with Celera Diagnostics to collaborate on new tests for Alzheimer's disease and breast and prostate cancer. This promising strategic alliance is the latest in a series of partnerships, including exclusive relationships with Myriad Genetics and EXACT Sciences, which continue to solidly position LabCorp's genomics testing business for future profitable growth." Nine Month Results: For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002, revenues were $1,857.6 million, an increase of 13.5 percent compared to the same period in 2001, and reflect the acquisition of Dynacare on July 25, 2002. Testing volume, measured by accessions, increased 9.5 percent compared to the prior year, or 6.5 percent on a pro forma basis, assuming that Dynacare had been part of LabCorp since January 1, 2001. Price per accession increased 4.0 percent compared to the 2001 period.
Net income was $211.9 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to $146.8 million in 2001, or $1.18 per diluted share, before the special items in both periods and adjusted for the required change in goodwill accounting. EBITDA was $439.9 million, or 23.7 percent of sales, compared to $363.8 million, or 22.2 percent of sales, adjusted for special items in both years. Operating cash flow was $326.4 million.
