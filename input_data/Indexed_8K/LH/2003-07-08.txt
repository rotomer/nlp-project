ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. Burlington, NC, July 7, 2003 - Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp-Registered Trademark-) (NYSE: LH) today announced that it has entered into a marketing and distribution relationship with Atherotech, a leading cardiodiagnostic company and specialty reference laboratory, to offer its proprietary Vertical Auto Profile (VAP-Trade mark-) Cholesterol Test. The multi-year agreement includes a provision for the transfer of patented testing technology to LabCorp, after which, if certain conditions are met, LabCorp would become the first clinical laboratory licensed to perform the cardiovascular disease risk assessment assay within its own national laboratory system. This innovative partnership will ensure broader patient access for Atherotech's VAP Test technology through LabCorp's extensive sales and distribution network, while adding an important test to LabCorp's already broad menu of esoteric assays for cardiovascular disease. According to the American Heart Association, coronary heart disease kills more Americans than any other illness, and reducing risk factors is extremely important. Atherotech's VAP Test is an expanded cholesterol test designed to improve the identification of people at risk for heart disease. It provides direct, detailed measurements of cholesterol subclasses that play important roles in the development of heart disease. "We are pleased to offer the VAP Cholesterol Test as part of our broadly available menu of service offerings for cardiovascular disease," said Myla Lai-Goldman, MD, executive vice president, medical director and chief scientific officer for LabCorp. "Many of our physician customers have been asking for this valuable test to help improve patient care. This initial strategic partnership with Atherotech is significant because it will increase patient access to important cardiovascular technology. We also continue to explore additional opportunities to further expand our relationship with Atherotech." "Cardiovascular disease is a major public health problem affecting nearly 60 million Americans, and the need for increased access to effective cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools is clear," said Atherotech President and Chief Executive Officer Roseanne Varner. "This new marketing and distribution relationship with LabCorp allows us to reach significantly more physicians who need technologies like our VAP Test to develop appropriate cardiovascular therapies for their patients." About Atherotech Atherotech, based in Birmingham, Ala., is dedicated to improving the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases that kill nearly 1 million people each year. The company's VAP Cholesterol Test, the new standard of care for cholesterol risk assessment, meets updated National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, which call for improved patient diagnosis and more aggressive treatment of heart disease. The test is reimbursed by a growing number of insurers and managed care organizations. For more information, visit the company's Web site at www.thevaptest.com.
