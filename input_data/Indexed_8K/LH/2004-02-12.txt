During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a net pre-tax restructuring credit of $1.8 million, representing the net of restructuring charges and adjustments. 2) EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and nonrecurring charges, and includes the Company's proportional share of the underlying EBITDA of the income from equity investments. The Company uses EBITDA extensively as an internal management performance measure and believes it is a useful, and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to earnings before taxes and other profitability measurements under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered as an alternative to earnings before income taxes (or any other performance measure under GAAP) as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles earnings before income taxes, representing the most comparable measure under GAAP, to EBITDA for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2003 2002 ------------------ ------------------ Earnings before income taxes $ 131.5 $ 90.6 $ 540.4 $ 432.3 Add (subtract): Interest expense 10.0 5.5 40.9 19.2 Investment income (0.3) (0.8) (5.1) (3.7) Other (income) expense, net 0.6 0.2 1.2 0.6 Depreciation 23.4 20.6 91.6 73.0 Amortization 10.1 7.4 37.6 23.8 Restructuring and other special items (1.8) -- 1.5 17.5 Equity investments' depreciation and amortization 0.9 0.4 3.4 1.1 ------ ------ ------ ------ EBITDA $ 174.4 $ 123.9 $ 711.5 $ 563.8 ====== ====== ====== ====== 3) The following table reconciles net earnings to net earnings before restructuring and other special items Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2003 2002 ------------------ ------------------ Net earnings $ 77.6 $ 53.0 $ 321.0 $ 254.6 ------ ------ ------ ------ Restructuring and other special items (1.8) -- 1.5 17.5 Provision for income taxes 0.7 -- (0.6) (7.3) ------ ------ ------ ------ (1.1) -- 0.9 10.2 ------ ------ ------ ------ Net earnings before restructuring and other special items $ 76.5 $ 53.0 $ 321.9 $ 264.8 ====== ====== ====== ======
