Laboratory Corporation of America-Registered Trademark-Holdings 358 South Main Street Burlington, NC 27215 Telephone: (336) 584-5171 For Immediate Release Contact: Pamela Sherry - (336) 436-4855 Shareholder Direct: (800) LAB-0401 Company Information: www.LabCorp.com LABCORP-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- ANNOUNCES U.S. LAUNCH OF EXCLUSIVE LIVER FIBROSIS ASSAY HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- Noninvasive Blood Test Provides Alternative to Liver Biopsy for Assessing Status of Hepatitis C Patients Burlington, NC, March 17, 2004 - Laboratory Corporation of America-Registered Trademark- Holdings (LabCorp-Registered Trademark-) (NYSE: LH) today announced the availability of HCV FIBROSURE-"TM", a noninvasive blood test for assessing liver status in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Developed by leading hepatologists at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital and BioPredictive in France, HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- is only available in the United States through LabCorp. HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- provides an easily accessible alternative to liver biopsy, which physicians use to assess liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in HCV patients. While liver biopsy has long been considered the gold standard to monitor the status of HCV and determine therapy options, it is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of serious complications. HCV FIBROSURE -"TM"- uses a combination of six serum biochemical markers plus age and gender in a patented algorithm to determine the degree of liver fibrosis and the level of ongoing necroinflammatory activity. The test, which has been clinically available in Europe for the past two years, has been shown in several studies to enable quantitative, reproducible assessment of fibrogenic and necrotic activity in the liver of HCV patients. "The launch of this important new test once again validates LabCorp's strategy of creating a world-class national laboratory with the best and broadest array of diagnostic testing services," said Myla P. Lai-Goldman, M.D., executive vice president, chief scientific officer and medical director at LabCorp. "Our focus on bringing forth innovative new technologies and tests, coupled with our scientific expertise and national scope, helps us broadly deliver vital new tools like BioPredictive's liver fibrosis assay to U.S. physicians managing HCV patients." BioPredictive is currently researching clinical use of this test for other disease populations, including hepatitis B, HIV-HCV, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic steato hepatitis (NASH). "We anticipate that HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- will prove to be just the first in a family of innovative, noninvasive diagnostic testing products aimed at hepatitis and non-hepatitis-related conditions," said Dr. Thierry Poynard, a world-renowned hepatologist, head of Hepato-Gastrotroenterology department in Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, and researcher and founder of BioPredictive. "We look forward to continuing our relationship with LabCorp and building upon their expertise in the world of hepatitis testing for future products." HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- is recommended for use to assess liver status following a diagnosis of HCV, as a baseline determination of liver status before initiating HCV therapy, as post-treatment assessment of liver status six months after therapy completion, and for noninvasive assessment of liver status in patients at risk of complications from a liver biopsy. The blood sample for HCV FIBROSURE-"TM"- can be collected in minutes and results can be returned to the physician within days. The test uses six biochemical markers that are routine and considered standard of care in the United States. About BioPredictive Founded at Paris University in 2002, BioPredictive is focused on the study, design and development of medically important biological tests. At the center of the company's scientific efforts is the desire to improve disease management by replacing invasive strategies with noninvasive alternatives. BioPredictive has developed two noninvasive tests for chronic liver disease - FibroTest and ActiTest. FibroTest is a biochemical marker of liver fibrosis and ActiTest is a biochemical marker of inflammation and necrosis of the liver. BioPredictive licenses the FibroTest and ActiTest technology from Assistance Public-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP). The company performs more than 2,000 tests per month, and services 150 private and 12 public hospital laboratories in France, Switzerland, Portugal, Morocco and Mexico.
