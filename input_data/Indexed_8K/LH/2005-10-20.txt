Financial Guidance for 2005 (cont'd.)
20
We expect the fourth quarter to be impacted by the continued
effects of third quarter hurricanes. We estimate the following
negative impacts:
Revenue - approximately $7.5 million
Volume - approximately 1%
EPS - approximately $0.02
As a reminder, there is one less revenue day in the fourth
quarter of 2005 versus the fourth quarter of 2004
Guidance does not include:
Any potential restructuring charges at LabCorp associated
with the continued integration of US LABS and Esoterix into
LabCorp, or
Future share repurchases beyond the third quarter.  
 
Preliminary Financial Guidance for 2006
Revenue growth of approximately 6.5% to 7.5% percent.
Diluted earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%, compared to LabCorp's 2005 guidance.
