To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the terms Representatives and Underwriters as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters. The terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (both, as defined herein).
 
Section 1. .
Representations and Warranties of the Company
 
The Company hereby represents, warrants and covenants to each Underwriter as follows:
 
(a) . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-130141), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Securities. Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it was declared effective by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), including any information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations
Registration Statement
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), is called the "Registration Statement." Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the final Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus relating to the Securities that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time"). Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
(b) The Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act upon its filing with the Commission. The Company has complied to the Commission's satisfaction with all requests of the Commission for additional or supplemental information. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, are contemplated or threatened by the Commission.
Compliance with Registration Requirements.
 
Each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus when filed complied or will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules thereunder and, if filed by electronic transmission pursuant to EDGAR (except as may be permitted by Regulation S-T under the Securities Act), was or will be identical to the copy thereof delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities. Each of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time it became effective and the Registration Statement at the date hereof, complied and will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date, at the time of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and, at the Closing Date (as defined herein), did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties set forth in the two immediately preceding sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Representatives consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof. There is no contract or other document required to be described in the Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement that has not been described or filed as required.
 
The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable. Any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable.
 
(c) .

As of 11:40 am (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Initial Sale Time"), the Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.

(a) During the period beginning on the Initial Sale Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), prior to amending or supplementing the

(d) If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, as the case may be, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representatives it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the

The Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Securities for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration

Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the Prospectus and any preliminary prospectus in (A) the last sentence on the cover page relating to the expected delivery of the Securities to investors, (B) the third and fourth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" (C) the two last sentences relating to Rule 2710 under the caption "Underwriting  Conflicts/Affiliates" and (D) the statements under the caption "Underwriting  Stabilization." The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
 
party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
 
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements.
 
Section 9If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds
. Contribution.
 
from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 10If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on
. Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters.
 
such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 6, Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
Section 11Prior to the Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by any exchange upon which it is listed for trading or included or designated for quotation, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof or (b) any Underwriter to the Company.
. Termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 12 The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an
. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.
 
advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
 
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
 
Section 13The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter or the Company, the officers or employees of the Company, or any person controlling the Company, as the case may be or (B) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder and (ii) will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation, promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal amount set forth on Schedule I hereto on December 15, 2015.
 
Interest Payment Dates: June 15 and December 15, commencing June 15, 2006.
 
Record Dates: June 1 and December 1.
 
Additional provisions of this Security are set forth on the other side of this Security.
 
Dated: December 14, 2005
 
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized series of debt securities of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), designated as the 5.625% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Securities") issued under an Indenture dated as of December 5, 2005 ("Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
 
The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall be entitled, without notice to or consent of the Securityholders, to issue additional debt securities under the Indenture on the same terms and conditions as the Securities (except for the interest accrual date and first interest payment date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities. The Securities and any additional debt securities will be treated as a single series of debt securities for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to create liens on assets and engage in Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The Indenture also contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company's Subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness or issuing preferred stock. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
 
 
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2006. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from December 14, 2005. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company will pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities plus 1% per annum, and it will pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.
 
 
The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the June 1 or December 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
 
 
Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated wholly owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
 
 
In accordance with Section 2.01(b) of the Indenture, the Securities are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or (2) the Make-Whole Amount for the Securities being redeemed.
 
For purposes of calculating the "Adjusted Treasury Rate" for the 5.625 % Senior Notes due 2015, the make-whole spread shall be 20 basis points; and Banc of America Securities LLC shall be one of the three Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Company as long as Banc of America Securities LLC remains a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer.
 
 
Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of, which shall include accrued interest on, all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption.
 
 
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all Securities as provided in Section 5 above, the Company will make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part (in multiples of $1,000 principal amount) of such Holder's Securities at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement thereof, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and stating:
 
(1) if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice;
 
(2) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 7 and that all Securities tendered will be accepted for payment;
 
(3) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date");
 
(4) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
 
(5) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Securities accepted for payment pursuant
 
to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date;
 
(6) that Holders electing to have any Securities purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Securities, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" attached to the Securities completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; and
 
(7) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if they deliver to the Paying Agent, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Securities delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Securities purchased.
 
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and any other federal and state securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change in Control Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 7, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 7 and all other provisions of the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company by virtue of such conflict.
 
(b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
(1) accept for payment all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
 
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and
 
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being purchased by the Company.
 
The Paying Agent shall promptly deliver to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Securities, and the
 
Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered, if any; that each new Security will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or a multiple thereof.
provided
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, the Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 7 and all other provisions of the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn under its Change of Control Offer.
 
(d) For purposes of the foregoing:
 
"Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.
 
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Securities are rated below Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies).
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
(1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our properties or assets and those of the Subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company;
 
(2) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
 
(3) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the Company, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or
 
(4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction effected to create a holding company for the Company will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction the Company becomes a wholly owned Subsidiary of such holding company and (2) the holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following such transaction are the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction.
 
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who:
 
(1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the first date that any of the Securities issued; or
 
(2) was nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination or election.
 
"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's) and BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P) (or, in each case, if such Rating Agency ceases to rate the Securities for reasons outside of the control of the Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any Rating Agency selected by the Company as a replacement Rating Agency).
 
"Moody's" means Moody's Investor Services Inc.
 
"Rating Agency" means:
 
(1) each of Moody's and S&P; and
 
(2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities or fails to make a rating of the Securities publicly available for reasons outside of our control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc.
 
"Voting Stock" as applied to stock of any Person, means shares, interests, participations or other equivalents in the equity interest (however designated) in such person having ordinary voting power for the election of a majority of the
 
directors (or the equivalent) of such person, other than shares, interests, participations or other equivalents having such power only by reason of the occurrence of a contingency.
 
 
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or 15 days before an interest payment date.
 
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
 
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
 
 
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
 
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture with respect to the Securities and the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision of the Indenture with respect to the Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities.
 
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company and the Trustee shall be entitled to amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or to comply with Article V of the Indenture, or to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to add additional covenants or to surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company or to add additional events of defaults or to add guarantees or to add to, delete from or revise the terms of a series of debt securities to be issued under the Indenture prior to the issuance thereof or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder in any material respect or to provide for the issuance of a new series of debt securities under the Indenture or to evidence the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
 
Under the Indenture, Events of Default for the Securities include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; (ii) default in payment of principal on the Securities, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations of other Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least $50.0 million; (v) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary to pay at maturity at least $50.0 million of other Indebtedness; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company.
 
Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Securities. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.
 
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
 
An incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company
 
under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
 
This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an Authenticating Agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
 
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
 
 
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
