FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) (NYSE: LH) today announced that it has licensed a drug response interpretation service from Seryx, LLC called Signature Genetics.
Burlington, NC, January 23, 2006 
Increasingly, physicians are using pharmacogenetic tests such as cytochrome P450 (CYP450) to determine if an individual carries genetic variants, or polymorphisms, impacting the safety or effectiveness of many commonly prescribed drugs. Some CYP450 polymorphisms cause patients to metabolize drugs too quickly, thereby reducing the drug's effectiveness at standard doses, while other variants slow the rate of drug metabolism, creating potentially toxic drug levels. Even with results from the various pharmacogenetic tests for CYP450, however, many physicians still resort to "trial and error" for prescribing and dosing drugs because the genetic information is complex and difficult to interpret.
The Signature Genetics interpretation and reporting service is intended to help take the "trial and error" out of selecting the most appropriate drug and establishing the most effective dosage for a given individual. Clinical and CYP450 genetic test information is evaluated by a vast "Signature Knowledge Base" and a comprehensive, actionable and personalized report is produced. The report details which medications should work most effectively and at what dose, which treatments might cause adverse reactions and/or react with other concurrent treatments, and which types of lifestyle and nutritional changes would have the greatest impact on improving patient health.
"LabCorp continually seeks to provide the latest testing technology and services to advance patient care," said Myla P. Lai-Goldman, M.D., Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer and Medical Director of LabCorp. "Combining genetic and clinical information and Seryx's robust technology to translate that information into a personalized action plan, is a high-value proposition for LabCorp physicians and their patients."
