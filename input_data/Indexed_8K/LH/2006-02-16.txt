2006 Financial Guidance
Before the required change in accounting for stock based compensation, guidance for 2006 is as follows and assumes completion of the $500 million share repurchase authorization announced on December 7, 2005:
Revenue growth of approximately 6.5% to 7.5% compared to 2005.
EBITDA margins of 26.0 to 26.5% of revenues.
Diluted EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.25.
Operating cash flow of between $600 and $620 million.
Capital expenditures of between $100 and $115 million.
Net interest expense of approximately $47 million.
Bad debt rate of approximately 5.3% of sales.
We estimate that the implementation of the required change in accounting for stock based compensation will have an EBITDA impact of approximately $25 million and a diluted EPS impact of approximately $0.11.
