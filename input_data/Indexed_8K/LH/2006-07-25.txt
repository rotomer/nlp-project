2006 Financial Guidance
Excluding the impact of the required change in accounting for stock based compensation, any share repurchase activity after June 30, 2006, and any accounting impact related to the previously announced retirement of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, guidance for 2006 is as follows:
Revenue growth of approximately 6.5% to 7.2% compared to 2005.
EBITDA margins of 26.5 to 27.0% of revenues.
Diluted EPS in the range of $3.28 to $3.33.
Operating cash flow of between $610 and $630 million.
Capital expenditures of between $95 and $110 million.
Net interest expense of between $43 and $45 million.
Bad debt rate of approximately 4.8% of sales for the remainder of the year.
We estimate that the implementation of the required change in accounting for stock based compensation will have an EBITDA impact of approximately $22 million to $23 million and a diluted EPS impact of approximately $0.10.
