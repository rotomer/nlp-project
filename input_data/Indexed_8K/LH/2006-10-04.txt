Burlington, NC, October 3, 2006 
Under the terms of the Agreement, LabCorp will become UnitedHealthcare's exclusive national laboratory offering a comprehensive suite of services, and will also work with other regional and local laboratory providers to selectively develop, implement and manage for UnitedHealthcare a series of laboratory networks in selected regions across the United States. As part of this network development and oversight process, LabCorp will assume responsibility for managing the Oxford Health Plans laboratory network located in the greater New York metropolitan region effective January 1, 2007. Also effective January 1, 2007, LabCorp will become the exclusive national capitated UnitedHealthcare laboratory provider for the HMO benefit plans of PacifiCare of Colorado, Neighborhood Health Partnership in Florida, and Mid Atlantic Medical Services, L.L.C. (MAMSI) in Maryland and Virginia, and will remain the exclusive provider for HMO benefit plans for PacifiCare of Arizona. Over a period of several years, LabCorp will continue to perform more of UnitedHealthcare's testing. During the first three years of the ten-year agreement, LabCorp has committed to reimburse UnitedHealthcare up to $200 million for transition costs related to developing an expanded network in the Oxford, MAMSI and Neighborhood Health Partnership markets, as well as in California and Colorado.
"We are very pleased to have been selected by UnitedHealthcare for this ten-year agreement and are excited by the opportunity to work with them as their only national laboratory partner," said David P. King, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of LabCorp. "Our new partnership with UnitedHealthcare is a further demonstration of our commitment to be the anatomic and clinical laboratory of choice for the country's leading health care companies. Effective prevention and treatment of disease are anchored in quality and customer efficient, evidence-based medicine, and members' access to superior laboratory diagnostics. UnitedHealthcare's customers and network physicians will continue to have access to a full range of the highest quality anatomic pathology and clinical laboratory services across the United States. LabCorp not only has the size and scale to offer these services across the United States, but also has the vision and industry-leading esoteric capabilities to provide clinical diagnostic testing tools for the future. In addition, LabCorp's standardized laboratory and billing systems will greatly enhance UnitedHealthcare's ability to provide relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care providers, consumers, employers, and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. These services will be available through LabCorp and its affiliated specialty laboratories, including DIANON , Esoterix, Endocrine Sciences, the National Genetics Institute, US LABS, Colorado Coagulation, the Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology, and ViroMed."
