A Holder of a Security may convert such Security into cash and shares of Common Stock in accordance  with  paragraph 9  of theSecurities,  subject to the  provisions of this  Article 10.  Subject to the method of  settlement  as set forth herein,  the number ofshares of Common Stock  issuable upon  conversion of a Security per $1,000 of Principal  Amount at Maturity  thereof (the  "ConversionRate") shall be that set forth in paragraph 9 in the Securities,  subject to adjustment as herein set forth.  The Company shall satisfyin cash its obligation with respect to the Accreted  Principal Amount of the Securities to be converted,  with the remaining amount, ifany, to be satisfied  in shares of Common  Stock,  in each case as set forth below.  The  settlement  amount for each $1,000  PrincipalAmount at Maturity of the Securities shall be computed as follows:(i)      a cash amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate Accreted Principal Amount of the Securities to be converted on the         Conversion Date and (ii) the Conversion Value of the Securities to be converted; and(ii)     if the Conversion Value exceeds the aggregate Accreted Principal Amount of the Securities to be converted, a number of         shares of Common Stock equal to the greater of (i) zero and (ii) the sum of, for each trading day of the Cash Settlement         Averaging Period, the quotient of (A) 10% of the difference between (1) the product of the Conversion Rate then in effect         and the Sale Price of the Common Stock for such day and (2) the Accreted Principal Amount of the Securities on the         Conversion Date, divided by (B) the Sale Price of the Common Stock for such day.         A Holder may  convert a portion of the  Principal  Amount at  Maturity  of a Security  if the portion is $1,000 or an integralmultiple of $1,000.  Provisions of this  Indenture  that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portionof a Security.         In the event that the Ex-Dividend Time (or in the case of a subdivision,  combination or reclassification,  the effective datewith respect thereto) with respect to a dividend, subdivision,  combination or reclassification to which Section 10.06(1),  (2), (3) or(5) applies occurs during the Cash Settlement  Averaging Period,  Sale Price shall be calculated for such period in a manner determinedby the Board of Directors to reflect the impact of such dividend,  subdivision,  combination or  reclassification  on the Sale Price ofthe Common Stock during such period.         If one or more  conditions  to the  conversion  of the  Securities  as set forth in  paragraph 9 of the  Securities  have beensatisfied,  the Company shall promptly notify the Holders and use its reasonable  best efforts to post this  information on its websiteor otherwise publicly disclose this information.Section 10.02       Conversion Procedure.         To convert a Security,  a Holder must satisfy the requirements in paragraph 9 of the Securities.  The date on which the Holdersatisfies all those  requirements  is the conversion date (the  "Conversion  Date").  The Conversion  Agent shall notify the Company ofthe  Conversion  Date within one Business Day of the Conversion  Date. The Company shall deliver to the Holder,  through the ConversionAgent,  on the third  trading day  following  the final trading day of the relevant  Cash  Settlement  Averaging  Period,  cash and, ifapplicable,  a  certificate  for the  number of full  shares of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon the  conversion  and cash in lieu of anyfractional  share  determined  pursuant  to  Section 10.03.  The  Person in whose  name the  certificate  representing  such  shares isregistered  shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion  Date;  provided,  however,  that no surrender of aSecurity on any date when the stock  transfer  books of the Company  shall be closed  shall be effective  to  constitute  the person orpersons  entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such  conversion  as the record holder or holders of such shares of CommonStock on such date,  but such  surrender  shall be effective  to  constitute  the person or persons  entitled to receive such shares ofCommon  Stock as the record  holder or holders  thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next  succeeding  day on whichsuch stock  transfer books are open;  such  conversion  shall be at the Conversion  Rate in effect on the date that such Security shallhave been  surrendered  for  conversion,  as if the stock  transfer  books of the Company had not been  closed.  Upon  conversion  of aSecurity, such person shall no longer be a Holder of such Security.         No payment or  adjustment  will be made for accrued  interest or  dividends  on, or other  distributions  with respect to, anyCommon Stock except as provided in this  Article 10.  On conversion of a Security,  (i) that portion of Accrued Original Issue Discountattributable to the period from  September 11,  2006 to, but excluding,  the Conversion Date, (ii) original issue discount,  as imputedfor United  States  federal  income tax purposes  pursuant to  Section 1.1275-4(b)  of the Treasury  Regulations  and (iii)  (except asprovided  below) that portion of accrued  Contingent  Cash Interest  attributable  to the period from the last Contingent Cash InterestPayment Date (or  September 11,  2006, if such date has not occurred)  ("Contingent  Cash Interest  Payment Date") to but excluding theConversion Date with respect to the converted  Security shall not be cancelled,  extinguished or forfeited,  but rather shall be deemedto be paid in full to the Holder  thereof  through  delivery of the Common Stock  (together  with the cash payment,  if any, in lieu offractional  shares) in exchange for the Security being converted  pursuant to the provisions  hereof; and the fair market value of suchshares of Common Stock  (together  with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional  shares) shall be treated as delivered pro rata, tothe extent  thereof,  first in exchange for (i) Accrued  Original Issue Discount to, but excluding the Conversion  Date,  (ii) originalissue discount,  as imputed for United States federal income tax purposes pursuant to  Section 1.1275-4(b)  of the Treasury Regulationsand (iii) accrued  Contingent Cash Interest to, but excluding,  the Conversion  Date, and the balance,  if any, of such cash and/or thefair  market  value of such  Common  Stock  (together  with any such cash  payment in lieu of  fractional  shares)  shall be treated asdelivered in exchange for the Issue Price of the Security  being  converted  pursuant to the  provisions  hereof.  Notwithstanding  theforegoing,  accrued but unpaid  Contingent Cash Interest will be payable upon conversion of Securities made  concurrently with or afteracceleration of Securities following an Event of Default.         If the Holder  converts  more than one  Security  at the same time,  the cash and  number of shares of Common  Stock,  if any,issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities converted.         A Security  surrendered  for  conversion  by a Holder  during the period from the close of business on any Common Stock RecordDate to the opening of business on the next  Contingent  Cash Interest  Payment Date must be  accompanied by payment of an amount equalto the Contingent  Cash Interest that the Holder is to receive on the Securities  surrendered  for  conversion,  unless the Company hasprovided such Holder with a notice of redemption with respect to such  Securities  pursuant to  Section 3.03  herein,  in which case nosuch payment shall be made.         If the last day on which a  Security  may be  converted  is a Legal  Holiday,  the  Security  may be  surrendered  on the nextsucceeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.         Upon  surrender of a Security that is converted in part,  the Company shall execute,  and the Trustee shall  authenticate  anddeliver to the Holder, a new Security in an authorized  denomination  equal in Principal Amount at Maturity to the unconverted  portionof the Security surrendered.Section 10.03       Fractional Shares.         The Company  will not issue a  fractional  share of Common  Stock upon  conversion  of a Security.  Instead,  the Company willdeliver  cash for the  current  market  value of the  fractional  share.  The  current  market  value of a  fractional  share  shall bedetermined,  to the nearest  1/1,000th of a share,  by multiplying the Sale Price of the Common Stock, on the last trading day prior tothe Conversion Date, of a full share by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent.Section 10.04       Taxes on Conversion.         If a Holder  converts a Security,  the Company  shall pay any  documentary,  stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on theissue of shares of Common  Stock,  if any,  upon the  conversion.  However,  the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because theHolder  requests  the  shares to be issued in a name other than the  Holder's  name.  The  Conversion  Agent may refuse to deliver  thecertificates  representing  the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion  Agent receives asum  sufficient  to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's  name.  Nothingherein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.Section 10.05       Company to Provide Stock.         The Company  shall,  prior to issuance of any  Securities  under this  Article 10,  and from time to time as may be necessary,reserve out of its authorized but unissued  Common Stock a sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of theSecurities.         All shares of Common Stock  delivered  upon  conversion of the  Securities  shall be newly issued  shares or treasury  shares,shall be duly and validly  issued and fully paid and  nonassessable  and shall be free from  preemptive  rights and free of any lien oradverse claim.         The Company will endeavor  promptly to comply with all federal and state  securities laws regulating the offer and delivery ofshares of Common  Stock upon  conversion  of  Securities,  if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock oneach national  securities exchange or in the  over-the-counter  market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed orquoted.Section 10.06       Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock.         If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company:(1)      pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its Common Stock;(2)      subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares;(3)      combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares;(4)      pays a dividend or makes a  distribution  on its Common  Stock in shares of its  Capital  Stock  (other  than Common  Stock or         rights, warrants or options for its Capital Stock); or(5)      issues by  reclassification  of its Common Stock any shares of its Capital  Stock (other than rights,  warrants or options for         its Capital Stock),then the conversion  privilege and the Conversion Rate in effect  immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holderof a Security  thereafter  converted  may receive the number of shares of Capital  Stock of the  Company  which such Holder  would haveowned immediately following such action if such Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to such action.         The  adjustment  shall  become  effective  immediately  after the record  date in the case of a dividend or  distribution  andimmediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.         If after an  adjustment a Holder of a Security upon  conversion of such Security may receive  shares of two or more classes ofCapital Stock of the Company,  the  Conversion  Rate shall  thereafter be subject to adjustment  upon the occurrence of an action takenwith respect to any such class of Capital  Stock as is  contemplated  by this  Article 10  with respect to the Common  Stock,  on termscomparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Article 10.Section 10.07       Adjustment for Rights Issue.         If after the Issue Date of the  Securities,  the Company  distributes  any  rights,  warrants or options to all holders of itsCommon Stock entitling them, for a period  expiring within 60 days after the record date for such  distribution,  to purchase shares ofCommon Stock at a price per share less than the Sale Price of the Common Stock as of the Time of  Determination,  the  Conversion  Rateshall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:                                    R'  =  R  x        (O + N)                                                   _______________                                                    O + (N x P)/M         where:         R' =  the adjusted Conversion Rate.         R  =  the current Conversion Rate.         O  =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07                is being applied.         N  =  the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered pursuant to the distribution.         P  =  the offering price per share of the additional shares.         M = the  Average  Sale  Price,  minus,  in the  case of  (i) a  distribution  to  which  Section 10.06(4)  applies  or  (ii) a                 distribution to which  Section 10.08  applies,  for which, in each case,  (x) the record date shall occur on or before                 the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07  applies and (y) the  Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on                 or after the date of the Time of Determination  for the  distribution to which this  Section 10.07  applies,  the fair                 market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies) of the:(1)      Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.06(4) distribution; and(2)      assets of the  Company  or Debt  securities  or any  rights,  warrants  or  options  to  purchase  securities  of the  Company         distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.08 distribution.         The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.07.

"Time of Determination"  means the time and date of the earlier of (i) the  determination of stockholders  entitled to receiverights,  warrants or options or a distribution,  in each case, to which Section 10.07 or 10.08 applies and (ii) the time ("Ex-DividendTime") immediately prior to the commencement of "ex-dividend"  trading for such rights,  warrants or options or distribution on the NewYork Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.         The adjustment  shall become effective  immediately  after the record date for the  determination of shareholders  entitled toreceive the rights,  warrants or options to which this  Section 10.07  applies.  If all of the shares of Common  Stock  subject to suchrights,  warrants  or options  have not been issued  when such  rights,  warrants or options  expire,  then the  Conversion  Rate shallpromptly be  readjusted  to the  Conversion  Rate which would then be in effect had the  adjustment  upon the  issuance of such rights,warrants or options  been made on the basis of the actual  number of shares of Common  Stock  issued upon the  exercise of such rights,warrants or options.         No adjustment  shall be made under this  Section 10.07  if the  application of the formula stated above in this  Section 10.07would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R.Section 10.08       Adjustment for Other Distributions.(a)      If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assetsexcluding distributions of Capital Stock or equity interests referred to in Section 10.08(b), or evidences of indebtedness of theCompany or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding(x) distributions of Capital Stock referred to in Section 10.06 and distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to inSection 10.07 and (y) cash dividends or other cash distributions that are paid out of consolidated current net earnings or earningsretained in the business as shown on the books of the Company, unless such cash dividends or other cash distributions areExtraordinary Cash Dividends (as defined below)) (except for the above restrictions, "Regular Cash Dividends") the Conversion Rateshall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of Section 10.08(c), in accordance with the formula:                           R'  =  R  x  M                                 __________                                   M - Fwhere:         R' =  the adjusted Conversion Rate.         R  =  the current Conversion Rate.         M = the Average  Sale Price,  minus,  in the case of a  distribution  to which  Section 10.06(4)  applies,  for which  (i) the                 record date shall occur on or before the record date for the distribution to which this  Section 10.08(a)  applies and                 (ii) the  Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on or after the date of the Time of Determination for the distribution to which                 this  Section 10.08(a)  applies,  the fair  market  value  (on the  record  date for the  distribution  to which  this                 Section 10.08(a)  applies) of any Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in                 such Section 10.06(4) distribution.

The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.08(a).         The adjustment  shall become effective  immediately  after the record date for the  determination of shareholders  entitled toreceive the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies.         No  adjustment  shall  be  made  under  this  Section 10.08(a)  if the  application  of  the  formula  stated  above  in  thisSection 10.08(a) would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R.         For purposes of this  Section 10.08(a),  the term  "Extraordinary  Cash Dividend" shall mean any cash dividend with respect tothe Common Stock the amount of which,  together with the aggregate  amount of cash dividends on the Common Stock to be aggregated  withsuch cash dividend in  accordance  with the  provisions of this  paragraph,  equals or exceeds the  threshold  percentage  set forth initem (i) below.  For purposes of item (i)  below,  the  "Measurement  Period" with respect to a cash dividend on the Common Stock shallmean the 365  consecutive  day period  ending on the date prior to the  Ex-Dividend  Time with respect to such cash  dividend,  and the"Relevant  Cash  Dividends"  with respect to a cash dividend on the Common Stock shall mean the cash dividends on the Common Stock withEx-Dividend Times occurring in the Measurement Period.(i)      If, upon the date prior to the Ex-Dividend  Time with respect to a cash dividend on the Common Stock,  the aggregate amount of         such cash dividend  together with the amounts of all Relevant  Cash  Dividends  equals or exceeds on a per share basis the sum         of (a) 5% of the Sale Price of the Common  Stock on the last trading day  preceding  the date of  declaration  by the Board of         Directors of the cash dividend or  distribution  with respect to which this provision is being applied,  and (b) the  quotient         of the amount of any Contingent  Cash Interest paid on a Security  during the  Ex-Dividend  Measurement  Period and divided by         the Conversion Rate in effect on the relevant  Contingent  Interest  Payment Date,  then such cash dividend  together with all         Relevant Cash  Dividends,  shall be deemed to be an  Extraordinary  Cash Dividend and for purposes of applying the formula set         forth  above in this  Section 10.08(a),  the value of "F" shall be equal to  (y) the  aggregate  amount of such cash  dividend         together with the amount of all Relevant Cash  Dividends,  minus (z) the  aggregate  amount of all Relevant Cash Dividends for         which a prior adjustment in the Conversion Rate was previously made under this Section 10.08(a).

R  = the current Conversion Rate.         M = the average of the  Post-Distribution  Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 trading days  commencing on and including thefifth trading day after the date on which  "ex-dividend  trading"  commences for such dividend or distribution on the principal  UnitedStates exchange or market which such securities are then listed or quoted (the "Ex-Dividend Date").         F = the  fair  market  value of the  securities  distributed  in  respect  of each  share  of  Common  Stock  for  which  thisSection 10.08(b)  is being applied shall mean the number of securities  distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock multipliedby the average of the  Post-Distribution  Prices of those  securities  distributed  for the 10 trading days commencing on and includingthe fifth trading day after the Ex-Dividend Date.(c)      "Post-Distribution Price" of Capital Stock or any similar equity interest on any date means the closing per unit sale price(or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average ofthe average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "when issued" basis without due bills (orsimilar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such CapitalStock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock or equity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United Statesnational or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System orby the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated; provided that if on any date such units have not traded on a "when issued" basis, thePost-Distribution Price shall be the closing per unit sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bidand ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date fortrading of such units on a "regular way" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions forthe principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock orequity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by theNational Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated.   In theabsence of such quotation, the Company shall be entitled to determine the Post-Distribution Price on the basis of such quotations,which reflect the post-distribution value of the Capital Stock or equity interests, as it considers appropriate.Section 10.09       When Adjustment May Be Deferred.         No adjustment in the Conversion  Rate need be made unless the adjustment  would require an increase or decrease of at least 1%in the  Conversion  Rate.  Any  adjustments  that are not made  shall be carried  forward  and taken  into  account  in any  subsequentadjustment.         All calculations  under this Article 10 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest  1/1,000th of a share, as the casemay be (with one-half of a cent and 5/10,000ths of a share being rounded upward).Section 10.10       When No Adjustment Required.

Subject  to the provisions of this paragraph 9, a Holder may convert into cash andshares of Common  Stock,  if any, a Security or portion of a Security  which has been  called for  redemption  pursuant to  paragraph 6hereof,  even if the Securities  are not otherwise  convertible  at such time,  but such  Securities may be surrendered  for conversionprior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date.

If the  Security is called for  redemption,  the Holder may convert it at any time prior tothe close of business on the second  Business Day  immediately  preceding the Redemption  Date. A Security in respect of which a Holderhas  delivered  a Purchase  Notice  exercising  the option of such  Holder to require the  Company to  purchase  such  Security  may beconverted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.         The initial  Conversion Rate is 13.4108 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount at Maturity,  subject to adjustmentupon occurrence of certain events  described in the Indenture.  The Company will deliver cash in lieu of any fractional share of CommonStock.         A Security  surrendered  for  conversion  by a Holder  during the period from the close of business on any Common Stock RecordDate to the opening of business on the next  Contingent  Cash Interest  Payment Date must be  accompanied by payment of an amount equalto the  Contingent  Cash Interest,  if any, that the Holder is to receive on the  Securities  surrendered  for  conversion,  unless theCompany  has  provided  such  Holder with a notice of  redemption  with  respect to such  Securities  pursuant  to Section  3.03 of theIndenture, in which case no such payment shall be made.         To convert a Security  represented by a Global Security,  a Holder must convert by book-entry transfer to the Conversion Agentthrough the facilities of DTC.         To convert a Security in  definitive  form,  a Holder must (1)  complete and  manually  sign the  conversion  notice below (orcomplete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion  Agent,  (2) surrender the Security tothe Conversion Agent, (3) furnish  appropriate  endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company orthe Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required.         A Holder may convert a portion of a Security  if the  Principal  Amount at  Maturity of such  portion is $1,000 or an integralmultiple of $1,000.  No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture.         The Conversion Rate will be adjusted for dividends or  distributions  on Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other CapitalStock;  subdivisions,  combinations  or certain  reclassifications  of Common  Stock;  distributions  to all holders of Common Stock ofcertain  rights  to  purchase  Common  Stock  for a  period  expiring  within  60 days at less  than  the  Sale  Price  at the  Time ofDetermination;  and distributions to such holders of assets or Debt securities of the Company or certain rights to purchase  securitiesof the Company  (excluding  certain cash  dividends or  distributions).  However,  no adjustment  need be made if  Securityholders  mayparticipate in the transaction or in certain other cases.  The Company from time to time may voluntarily increase the Conversion Rate.         If the Company is a party to a consolidation,  merger or binding share exchange or a transfer of all or  substantially  all ofits assets, or upon certain  distributions  described in the Indenture,  the right to convert a Security into cash and shares of CommonStock,  if any, may be changed into a right to convert it into the kind and amount of  securities,  cash or other assets of the Companyor  another  person  which the  Holder  would  have  received  if the Holder had  converted  its  Securities  immediately  prior to thetransaction  into a number  of  shares of Common  Stock  equal to the then  applicable  Conversion  Rate,  subject  to the  adjustmentsdiscussed under Section 10.14(b) of the Indenture.         The Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for any Accrued Original Issue Discount or any accrued  Contingent Cash Interest,  ifany.10.      Conversion Arrangement on Call for Redemption.         Any Securities called for redemption,  unless  surrendered for conversion before the close of business on the Redemption Date,may be deemed to be purchased  from the Holders of such  Securities  at an amount not less than the  Redemption  Price,  by one or moreinvestment  banks or other  purchasers  who may agree with the Company to purchase such  Securities  from the Holders,  to convert theminto cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, and to make payment for such Securities to the Trustee in trust for such Holders.11.
