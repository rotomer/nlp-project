FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) (NYSE: LH), one of the world's leading clinical laboratories, today announced that it will no longer be a contracted laboratory provider for Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET), effective July 1, 2007.
Burlington, NC, March 1, 2007
"We are disappointed with Aetna's decision, but we are confident in our strategy for profitable growth," stated David P. King, Chief Executive Officer of LabCorp. "Aetna has been a valued partner of ours for many years, and our recent expansion in their core Northeast markets means that we will be able to continue serving Aetna physicians and patients. We regret that we will do so as an out-of-network provider."
LabCorp estimates that its 2007 earnings per share will be reduced by $0.04 to $0.12 primarily as a result of this contract termination.
"We remain focused on our strategic plan, a key component of which is expanding our managed care relationships and providing physicians and their patients with the nation's most efficient, highest quality, and most advanced laboratory diagnostics," said King.
