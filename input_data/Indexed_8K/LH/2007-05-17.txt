Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. In January 2007, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued a Practice Bulletin recommending that, regardless of age, all pregnant women should be offered screening for Down syndrome. ACOG's new recommendation states that, ideally, patients should be offered testing that combines first- and second-trimester screening. LabCorp is the first full-service, national clinical laboratory in the U.S. to license Intema's Integrated and Sequential Down syndrome technology for screening analyses. When Integrated screening and Sequential screening test results include a fetal ultrasound nuchal translucency measurement, the highest Down syndrome detection rates are achieved and fewer false-positives are experienced than with current first- or second-trimester screening. "LabCorp is pleased to add the Integrated and Sequential Down syndrome screening tests to our comprehensive menu of prenatal testing services," said LabCorp's Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer and Medical Director, Myla P. Lai-Goldman, M.D. "These additional screening tools will allow physicians to offer patients a broader range of tests for screening with higher detection rates and low false-positive rates. This can help reduce the number of invasive tests needed and potentially reduce the number of procedure-related pregnancy losses."
