MGMT methylation has been shown to be a common event in many cancers and predictive of response to some cancer therapies. For example, MGMT methylation status has been shown to be a promising potential predictor of response to alkylating agent-based chemotherapies used to treat patients with malignant brain tumors, and therefore is of interest to oncologists who treat such patients. LabCorp plans to determine MGMT methylation status using Methylation-Specific PCR technology licensed from OncoMethylome Sciences.
Because of the potential for broader applications of this oncology marker, the evaluation of MGMT methylation is being integrated into numerous international clinical trials for patients with brain cancer and other cancers. The trials are conducted by organizations such as the U.S.-based Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).
"This test is aligned with our focus on companion diagnostics and we are excited by the potential of the MGMT methylation test to help oncologists provide better patient care and guide therapy decisions. Laboratory tests for gene methylation are an important and differentiating addition to our menu of oncology services and allow us to offer a more complete package of services to oncologists and their patients," commented Dr. Myla-Lai-Goldman, Executive Vice President, Medical Director and Chief Scientific Officer for LabCorp.
"Licensing of our MGMT methylation technology to a major clinical laboratory, such as LabCorp, marks a significant milestone for OncoMethylome's companion diagnostics program and the advancement of personalized medicine", commented Herman Spolders, Chief Executive Officer of OncoMethylome. "We will continue to work with major pharmaceutical companies, oncology

organizations and other stakeholders to identify and validate other methylation-based cancer biomarkers that can aid physicians in optimizing patient treatment and outcome."
Methylation is a natural control mechanism that regulates gene expression. Abnormal methylation of certain genes can silence their expression and those changes may be associated with cancer development and response to cancer therapy. Genes whose methylation is linked to cancer are often called methylation biomarkers. Methylation biomarkers intended for use in companion diagnostics are associated with response to cancer drug therapy. OncoMethylome owns proprietary technology that is highly sensitive and capable of detecting methylation biomarkers, and is also very suitable for testing these markers in a high-throughput manner on clinical samples.
