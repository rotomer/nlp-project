ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
On July 14, 2008, Laboratory Corporation of AmericaHoldings (LabCorp) (NYSE: LH) announced it is now offering ColoSure, among the most sensitive, in-guideline non-invasive colorectal cancer screening methods available. ColoSure is in guidelines for assessing the presence of any stage of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average risk patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo a more invasive exam (such as colonoscopy, computed tomographic colonography, double contrast barium enema, and flexible sigmoidoscopy). The assay is performed on a complete bowel movement with a simple collection process, making it a convenient and useful screening option. LabCorp's method examines DNA in exfoliated colon cells for cancer-associated aberrant methylation of the vimentin gene. ColoSure is a single marker laboratory developed, stool based DNA test with a sensitivity range of 72-77% and a specificity range of 83-94% in average risk individuals. The ColoSure assay can be used as a part of a comprehensive, ongoing colorectal cancer-screening program. Current guidelines emphasize routine screening beginning at age 50.

"LabCorp is pleased to offer ColoSure to enhance the potential of detecting and treating colorectal cancer in its early or localized stage, when the likelihood of survival is greatest," said Myla P. Lai-Goldman, M.D., Executive Vice President, and Chief Medical Officer of LabCorp. "ColoSure is a significant addition to LabCorp's family of advanced molecular tests, to aid in the detection, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy selection, and surveillance of colorectal cancer."
 
It has been estimated that for the year 2008, 148,810 men and women will be newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer. It has been further estimated that 49,960 will die from the disease in 2008. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer among women and men. If colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated at the localized stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90%; unfortunately, only 39% of all cases are found at the localized stage. Most colorectal cancers are detected at the regional or distant stage when the 5-year survival rates are 68% and 10% respectively.
