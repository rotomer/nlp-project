Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(In millions)
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and includes the Company's proportional share of the underlying EBITDA of the income from joint venture partnerships.  The Company uses EBITDA extensively as an internal management performance measure and believes it is a useful, and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to earnings before taxes and other profitability measurements under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered as an alternative to earnings before income taxes (or any other performance measure under GAAP) as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.  The following table reconciles earnings before income taxes, representing the most comparable measure under GAAP, to EBITDA for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007:
