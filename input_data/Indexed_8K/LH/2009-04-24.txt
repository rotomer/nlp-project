EXHIBIT A
Laboratory Corporation of America
 
William B. Haas
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings
430 South Spring Street
Burlington, NC 27215
 
Dear Mr. Haas:
 
This letter is intended to memoralize your agreement, as the Executive Vice President of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings ("the Company"), to certain duties of confidentiality, non-competition, and similar matters during your employment, and following your termination of employment, with the Company and any of its affiliates (collectively, "LabCorp"). If you sign and return this letter on or before June 11, 2004, you will satisfy the requirement of Section 2 of the Senior Executive Transition Policy for being an "Eligible Senior Executive" as defined in that Policy.
 
Defined Terms.
For purposes of this letter, "Laboratory Testing" refers to the collection for testing and/or testing of specimens from human beings for the purposes of diagnosis, treatment, or care of disease or illness; monitoring or providing data for the analysis of a regimen of treatment, a therapy, or a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure; and/or detection or analysis of the presence or absence of factors, chemicals or compounds. "Clinical Trial" refers to assembling, validating, or analyzing data relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug or medical device.
 
Receipt of Confidential Information.
You acknowledge that in the course of your employment with LabCorp, you have developed and will develop an extensive knowledge of LabCorp's business, including but not limited to business strategies, cost information, marketing information, product and service information, new products and services under development, and plans for the expansion of product and service lines (including, without limitation, plans for the acquisition or licensing of intellectual property relating to Laboratory Testing). In addition, you acknowledge that in your employment you have access to information regarding LabCorp's business plans, sales methods, and customers on a corporate-wide basis in every market in which LabCorp conducts business. The knowledge and information referred to above will be referred to as "Confidential Information."
 
Competition.
You and the company agree that LabCorp will suffer significant and irreparable injury, for which damages at law would not be a measurable or adequate remedy, if you become employed by any corporation or entity that competes with LabCorp or if you provide services to any such corporation or entity in any other capacity that would permit you to take advantage of the Confidential Information acquired by you during the course of your employment with LabCorp (including by breaching any of the numbered covenants contained in this paragraph). Accordingly, you agree that during your employment by LabCorp and for a period of (2) years following your termination of employment, you will not, directly or indirectly:
 
 
 
 
 
You agree that the foregoing restrictions are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company; are reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time, geographic scope, customer scope, and scope of activity to be restrained; and are not unduly harsh and oppressive so as to deprive you of a livelihood or to unduly restrict your opportunity to earn a living after termination of your employment with the Company.
 
Confidentiality.
During the term of your employment with LabCorp and thereafter, except as require by or pursuant to law, you shall not, without the written consent of the Board or a person authorized thereby, disclose to any person, other than an employee of LabCorp or a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by you of your duties as a Senior Executive of LabCorp, any Confidential Information or Business Information obtained by you while in the employ of LabCorp. The term "Business Information" means any information pertaining to LabCorp's conduct of its Laboratory Testing and/or Clinical Trial business that is not readily and easily available to the public or to those in LabCorp's industry, including, without limitation, LabCorp's prices, pricing methods, costs, profits, profit margins, suppliers, procedures, processes, research and development projects, data, goals, activities, business strategies, marketing techniques, the identities or addresses of LabCorp's employees, the functions of LabCorp's employees, and any customer-related information.
 
Property.
During the term of this Agreement, you shall not make, copy, maintain, distribute, divulge the contents of, or remove from LabCorp's offices or premises any documents, records, or similar materials containing Confidential Information or Business Information unless necessary or appropriate in accordance with your duties and responsibilities as [President OR Executive Vice President]. Upon termination of your employment with LabCorp, you shall leave with or immediately return to LabCorp all originals and copies of the foregoing LabCorp property then in your possession, whether prepared by you or by others.
 
Duty of Loyalty/Nondisparagement.
During the terms of your employment and for a period of five years following your termination of employment, you will not (except as required by or pursuant to law) communicate to anyone, whether by word or deed, whether directly or through any intermediary, and whether expressly or by suggestion or innuendo, any statement, whether characterized as one of fact or of opinion, that is intended to cause or that reasonably would be expected to cause any person to whom it is communicated to have (1) a lowered opinion of the company or any affiliate, including a lowered opinion of any products manufactured, sold, or used by, or any services offered or rendered by the Company or any affiliate; and/or (2) a lowered opinion of the creditworthiness or business prospects of the company or any affiliate.
 
Interpretation and Enforcement.
You and the Company agree that this letter will be interpreted and construed under the laws of North Carolina (exclusive of any laws relating to choice of law in the event of conflicts of law and of any principle causing ambiguities to be construed against the drafter), and that the covenants contained in the Competition portion of this letter will be construed and interpreted so as to permit their enforcement to the maximum extent permitted there under (including, to the extent necessary, by treating each provision of this letter as severable and separately enforceable, and/or by reforming any such separate provisions to the minimum extent necessary to permit enforcement of such covenants to the fullest extent permitted). You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of North Carolina over any action or proceeding relating to the validity and/or construction of this letter, and agree that you will not bring or remove any such action or proceeding other than in or to a court established by the State of North Carolina.
 
If this Agreement is acceptable to you, please sign and date this letter where indicated below.
 
 
 
Accepted:
 
William B. Haas
Executive Vice President
