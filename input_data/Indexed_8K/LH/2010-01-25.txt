"K-RAS testing should be routinely conducted in all colorectal cancer patients immediately after diagnosis to ensure the best treatment strategies for the individual Patient"
 Dr. Eric Van Cutsem, presenter at the June 2008 American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting
FDA recommends genetic screening prior to treatment with Abacavir
ROCKVILLE, Md -- July 24, 2008 -- The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an alert regarding serious, and sometimes fatal, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) caused by abacavir (Ziagen) therapy in patients with a particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B* 5701.
Genetic tests for HLA-B*5701 are already available, and all patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele before starting or restarting treatment with abacavir or abacavir-containing medications.
"FDA has approved the expanded use of Selzentry to include adult patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus who are starting treatment for the first time."
