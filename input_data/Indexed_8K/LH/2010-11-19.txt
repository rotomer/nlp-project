on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 and as at September 30, 2010 carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with the standards

(iii)
 
they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions Summary  Summary

.  (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statemen t or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company wi ll not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to
 
17
 
 
any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Notes and, under the heading Underwriting, (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Notes, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnificat ion obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

(d)           In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively Losses) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the me aning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of
Default by an Underwriter

Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Comp any, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register (as hereinafter defined), not less than 10 days prior to such special record date.

(2)           The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

(b)           Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.05, only to the Depositary for such series, another nominee of the Depositary for such series, or to a successor Depositary for such series selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(c)           If at any time the Depositary for a series of the Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized d enominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any

In such event the Company will execute and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be regist ered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.

(b)           at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished;
 
provided, however, that, in either case, no such list need be furnished for any series for which the Trustee shall be the Security Registrar.
 
SECTION 2.13

(a)           The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Securities contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 2.12 and as to the names and addresses of holders of Securities received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar (if acting in such capacity).

CUSIP NUMBERS.
 
The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
 
SECTION 2.15
 
OUTSTANDING SECURITIES.
 
Securities of a series outstanding at any time are all Securities of such series authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.15 as not outstanding. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.04, a Security of a series does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
 
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a protected person (as such term is defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code).

On or after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities to be redeemed.
 
SECTION 3.07
 
SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where Securities of a series may be presented or surrendered for any and all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency i n the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, State of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give to the Trustee prompt written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any change of location thereof.

SECTION 6.01
 
EVENTS OF DEFAULT.
 
An Event of Default occurs with respect to a series of Securities if:
 
28
 
 
(1)           the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any of the Securities of that series when the same becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
 
(2)           the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any of the Securities of that series when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon declaration or otherwise;
 
(3)           the Company fails to comply with Section 5.01;
 
(4)           the Company fails to comply with any of its agreements in the Securities of that series or this Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above) and such failure continues for 90 days after the notice specified below;
 
(5)           any default or event of default under any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary to the seller of a business or asset incurred in connection with the purchase thereof) which default or event of default results in at least $50.0 million of aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being declared due and payable prior to maturity (the cross acceleration provision);
 
(6)           failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay at maturity or otherwise when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace period) at least $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness at any one time;
 
(7)           the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
 
(A)           commences a voluntary case;
 
(B)           consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;
 
(C)           consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property;
 
(D)           makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or
 
(E)           takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or
 
29
 
 
(8)           a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
 
(A)           is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case;
 
(B)           appoints a Custodian of the Company or for any substantial part of its property; or
 
(C)           orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company;
 
or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order, decree or relief remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days.
 
The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. No Event of Default with respect to a single series of Securities issued hereunder (and under or pursuant to any supplemental indenture, Officers Certificate or Board Resolution) specific to such series shall constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of Securities unless otherwise provided in this Indenture or any supplemental indenture, Officers Certificate or Board Resolution with respect to any other series of Securities.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Default under Section 6.01(4) shall not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in Section 6.01(4) after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a Notice of Default.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, promptly after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers Certificate of any Event of Default under clauses (3), (5), (6), (7) and (8) and, within 60 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
SECTION 6.02
 
ACCELERATION.
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of
 
30
 
 
such series by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) occurs, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of such series shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of accelera tion. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
 
SECTION 6.03
 
OTHER REMEDIES.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of Securities, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of such series or this Indenture.
 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
 
SECTION 6.04
 
WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.
 
The Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of such series by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
 
SECTION 6.05
 
CONTROL BY MAJORITY.
 
The Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of such series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that
 
31
 
 
the Trustee reasonably determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or, in the Trustees reasonable opinion, would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
 
SECTION 6.06
 
LIMITATION ON SUITS.
 
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder of Securities of a particular series may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of such series unless:
 
(1)           the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing;
 
(2)           the Holders of at least 25% in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of such series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
 
(3)           such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
 
(4)           the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
(5)           the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.
 
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
 
SECTION 6.07
 
RIGHTS OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENT.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
 
32
 
 
SECTION 6.08
 
COLLECTION SUIT BY TRUSTEE.
 
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as Trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.
 
SECTION 6.09

(g)           Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01 and to the provisions of the TIA.

(g)           In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

SECTION 7.04
 
TRUSTEES DISCLAIMER.
 
The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Companys use of the proceeds from the Securities or any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent (other than itself as Paying Agent), and it shall not be responsible for any statement in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustees certificate of authentication.
 
SECTION 7.05
 
NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.
 
If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 60 days after it occurs or promptly upon the Trustees attaining knowledge of such Default or Event of Default, whichever comes first. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, or interest on, any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.
 
SECTION 7.06
 
REPORTS BY TRUSTEE TO HOLDERS.
 
As promptly as practicable after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, and in any event prior to July 15 in each year,
 
37
 
 
if required by TIA Section 313, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports required by TIA Section 313(c).
 
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed by the Company with the Commission and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof.
 
SECTION 7.07
 
COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY.
 
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation for its services. The Trustees compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a Trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, costs of preparing and reviewing reports, certificates and other documents, costs of preparation and mailing of notices to Holders and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Trustee in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustees agents, counsel, accountants and experts.

Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustees own willful misconduct, negligence o r bad faith.
 
To secure the Companys payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. The Trustees right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.07 shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the Company.
 
38
 
 
The Companys payment obligations pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
 
SECTION 7.08
 
REPLACEMENT OF TRUSTEE.
 
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Article.  The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of a series may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee as to such series. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
 
(1)           the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
 
(2)           the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
 
(3)           a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
(4)           the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall (upon payment of its charges) promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07.
 
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in outstanding principal amount of the Securities of a series at the expense of the
 
39
 
 
Company may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Companys obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
 
SECTION 7.09
 
SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE BY MERGER.
 
If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation or banking association without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
 
If at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Securities of a series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee, and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and if at that time any of the Securities of a series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of a series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
 
SECTION 7.10
 
ELIGIBILITY; DISQUALIFICATION.
 
The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Section 310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA Section 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA Section 310(b)(1) are met.
 
40
 
 
SECTION 7.11
 
PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.
 
The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated.
 
 
 
SECTION 8.01
 
EVIDENCE OF ACTION BY SECURITYHOLDERS.
 
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing. If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by a n Officers Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of outstanding Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the rec ord date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
 
41
 
 
SECTION 8.02
 
PROOF OF EXECUTION BY SECURITYHOLDERS.
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
 
(a)           The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
 
(b)           The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
 
(c)           The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
 
SECTION 8.03
 
WHO MAY BE DEEMED OWNERS.
 
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 8.04
 
CERTAIN SECURITIES OWNED BY COMPANY DISREGARDED.
 
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by any Person directly or indirectly Controlling or Controlled by or under common Control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the
 
42
 
 
pledgees right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not a Person directly or indirectly Controlling or Controlled by or under direct or indirect common Control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities of a series outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination.
 
SECTION 8.05
 
ACTIONS BINDING ON FUTURE SECURITYHOLDERS.
 
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registra tion of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.
 
 
 
SECTION 9.01

(5)           to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder in any material respect;
 
(6)           to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of the Securities of any series as provided in Section 2.01, to establish the form of any certifications required to be furnished pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or any series of Securities, or to add to the rights of the holders of any series of Securities; or
 
(7)           to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.08.
 
The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture that affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

45
 
 
holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders of any series affected thereby under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by its Board Resolutions authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders required to consent thereto as aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture.

conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by, and conforms to, the terms of this Article and that it is proper for the Trustee under the provisions of this Article to join in the execution thereof; provided, however, that such Opinion of Counsel and Officers Certificate need not be provided in connection with the execution of a supplemental indenture that establishes the terms of a series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.
 
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall transmit at the expense of the Company by mail, first class postage prepaid, a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
 
SECTION 9.06
 
PAYMENT FOR CONSENT.
 
Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Securities of a series or this Indenture with respect to the Securities of a series unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders of a series of Securities that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
 
 
 
SECTION 10.01
 
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE.
 
This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect with respect to a series of Securities (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of such series of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series, when:
 
(1)           either (A) all Securities of that series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) any Securities that shall have been destroyed, lost or stolen and that shall have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.07 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money or noncallable Governmental Obligations have theretofore been deposited in
 
47
 
trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.05) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will by their terms become due and payable within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption, and the Company shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose (x) moneys in an amount, or (y) noncallable Governmental Obligations the scheduled principal of and interest on which in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (z) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the case of (y) or (z), in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, at maturity or upon redemption, all Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal (and premium, if any) and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be;
 
(2)           the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder with respect to such series by the Company; and
 
(3)           the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all the conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to a series of Securities, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 7.07 and, if money and or securities shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (iii) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
 
SECTION 10.02
 
DEFEASANCE.
 
(a)           Subject to Sections 10.02(b) and 10.03, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all of its obligations under a particular series of Securities and under this Indenture with respect to that series of Securities (Legal Defeasance Option) or (2) with respect to a particular series of Securities, its obligations under Sections 4.06, 4.07 and 4.08 (Covenant Defeasance Option); provided, however, no deposit under this Article X shall be effective to terminate the obligations of the Company under a series of Securities or this Indenture with respect to that series of Securities prior to 91 days following any such deposit.
 
48
 
 
The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance Option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
 
If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance Option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its Covenant Defeasance Option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4) due to a violation of Sections 4.06, 4.07 and 4.08.
 
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
 
(b)           The Companys obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 7.07 and 7.08 and this Article X shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Companys obligations in Sections 7.07 and 10.05 shall survive.

(2)           the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited Governmental Obligations plus any deposited money without reinvestment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities of that series to Stated Maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
 
(3)           91 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 91-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) occurs which is continuing at the end of the periods;

(5)           the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or
 
49
 
 
is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940;
 
(6)           in the case of the Legal Defeasance Option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred;
 
(7)           in the case of the Covenant Defeasance Option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders shall not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and shall be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;
 
(8)           the Securityholders shall have a perfected security interest under applicable law in the cash or Governmental Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 10.03(1) above;
 
(9)           the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, to the effect that, after the passage of 91 days following the deposit, the trust funds shall not be subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar law affecting creditors rights generally;
 
(10)           such defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest with respect to any securities of the Company; and
 
(11)           the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities and this Indenture as contemplated by this Article X have been complied with.
 
Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article III.

ANNEX A
 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this Supplemental Indenture), dated as of [                    ] among [                    ] (the Subsidiary Guarantor), a [                    ] corporation and a subsidiary of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation (or its permitted successor) (the Company), the Company, [other Subsidiary Guarantors] and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee under the Indenture (the Trustee).
 
 
WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee an indenture (the Indenture), dated as of [                    ], [                    ], providing for the issuance of a series of its senior debt securities designated as the [                ] (the Securities);
 
WHEREAS, in its discretion, the Company may have the Subsidiary Guarantor to execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which the Subsidiary Guarantor will Guarantee payment of the Securities; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01(4) of the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantor[, the other Subsidiary Guarantors] and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities as follows:
 
SECTION 1. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
SECTION 2. Guaranties. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees[, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors], to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Securities (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the Obligations).
 
57
 
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from the Subsidiary Guarantor and that the Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Supplemental Indenture notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. The Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Obligations. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (d) the release of any securi ty held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 7 of this Supplemental Indenture, any change in the ownership of the Subsidiary Guarantor.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Obligations.
 
Except as expressly set forth in Section 10.02 of the Indenture and Sections 3 and 7 of this Supplemental Indenture, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture, th e Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
 
58
 
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against the Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Obligation, the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the T rustee.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI of the Indenture for the purposes of the Subsidiary Guarantors guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article VI of the Indenture, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 2.
 
SECTION 3. Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Supplemental Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by the Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Supplemental Indenture, as it relates to the Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
 
SECTION 4. Successors and Assigns. This Supplemental Indenture shall be binding upon the Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the
 
59
 
 
Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Supplemental Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
SECTION 5. No Waiver. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Supplemental Indenture shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Supplemental Indenture at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
 
SECTION 6. Modification. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Supplemental Indenture, nor the consent to any departure by the Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle the Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
 
SECTION 7. Release. Upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), the Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request and expense of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
 
Upon the merger or consolidation of the Subsidiary Guarantor with or into, or the dissolution and liquidation of the Subsidiary Guarantor into, a Subsidiary Guarantor or another Person that Guarantees the Securities, the Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request and expense of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
 
SECTION 8. Governing Law. This Supplemental Indenture shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York but without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.
 
60
 
 
SECTION 9. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or of the Subsidiary Guarantor under its guaranty, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder shall waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
SECTION 10. Multiple Originals. The parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement. One signed copy is enough to prove this Supplemental Indenture.
 
SECTION 11. Headings. The headings of the Sections of this Supplemental Indenture have been inserted for convenience of reference only, are not intended to be considered a part hereof and shall not modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions hereof.
 
SECTION 12. Contribution. The Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed Obligations to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
61
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed as of the date first written above.

The Company will cause notice of the special mandatory redemption to be mailed, with a copy to the Trustee, within five business days after the occurrence of the event triggering redemption to each holder at its registered address. If funds sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price of all Notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date are deposited with the Trustee on or before such Special Mandatory Redemption Date, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Notes will cease to bear interest.
