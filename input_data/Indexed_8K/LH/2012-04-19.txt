9 Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures - Footnotes Note: GENZYME GENETICS and its logo are trademarks of Genzyme Corporation and used by Esoterix Genetic Laboratories, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of LabCorp, under license. Esoterix Genetic Laboratories and LabCorp are operated independently from Genzyme Corporation. 1) During the first quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a net credit of $3.6 million in restructuring and other special charges. The Company reversed previously established reserves of $3.8 million in unused severance and $2.4 million in unused facility-related costs. This net credit also includes charges of $1.7 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $0.9 million in facility- related costs primarily related to ongoing integration activities for Orchid and Genzyme Genetics. The after tax impact of the net credit increased net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, by $2.2 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.02 ($2.2 million divided by 99.1 million shares). 2) During the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $27.9 million. The charges included $4.0 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $9.8 million in facility-related costs associated with the integration of Genzyme Genetics. The charges also included a $14.8 million write-off of an investment made in a prior year. The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, by $16.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.16 ($16.9 million divided by 103.2 million shares). 3) The Company continues to grow the business through acquisitions and uses Adjusted EPS Excluding Amortization as a measure of operational performance, growth and shareholder returns. The Company believes adjusting EPS for amortization provides investors with better insight into the operating performance of the business. For the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, intangible amortization was $21.4 million and $21.9 million, respectively ($13.1 million and $13.2 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.13 ($13.1 million divided by 99.1 million shares) and $0.13 ($13.2 million divided by 103.2 million shares), respectively.
