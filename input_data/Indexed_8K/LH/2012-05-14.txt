FDA approves Zelboraf and companion diagnostic test for late-stage skin cancer This has been an important year for patients with late-stage melanoma. Zelboraf is the second new cancer drug approved that demonstrates an improvement in overall survival, Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Oncology Drug Products in the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. FDA approves Xalkori with companion diagnostic for a type of late-stage lung cancer The approval of Xalkori with a specific test allows the selection of patients who are more likely to respond to the drug. Targeted therapies such as Xalkori are important options for treating patients with this disease and may ultimately result in fewer side effects. Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Oncology Drug Products in the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. FDA clears HE4 test in ROMA for ovarian malignancy risk "Using ROMA with HE4 and CA 125 significantly improves our ability to identify women who are at high or low likelihood of ovarian cancer when they present with an ovarian cyst or mass," Richard Moore, MD, associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University and director of the Center for Biomarkers and Emerging Technologies in the Program for Women's Oncology at Women and Infants' Hospital (Providence, Rhode Island).

Esoterix Genetic Laboratories and LabCorp are operated independently from Genzyme Corporation. 1) During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded net restructuring and other special charges of $10.6 million, consisting of $6.3 million in severance related liabilities and $1.7 million in net facility-related costs primarily associated with integration of the Orchid Cellmark and Genzyme Genetics acquisitions as well as internal cost reduction initiatives. The charges also included a $2.6 million write-off of an uncollectible receivable from a past installment sale of one of the Companys lab operations. The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2011, by $6.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.06 ($6.5 million divided by 101.0 million shares). During the first nine months of 2011, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $105.9 million ($66.3 million after tax). The restructuring charges included $18.8 million in net severance and other personnel costs along with $36.7 million in net facility-related costs primarily associated with the ongoing integration of the Clearstone, Genzyme Genetics and Westcliff acquisitions. The special charges also included $34.5 million ($49.5 million, net of previously recorded reserves of $15.0 million) relating to the settlement of the Hunter Labs litigation in California, along with $1.1 million for legal costs associated with the planned acquisition of Orchid Cellmark incurred during the second quarter of 2011, both of which were recorded in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charges also included a $14.8 million write-off of an investment made in a prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the after tax impact of these combined charges of $116.5 million decreased net earnings by $73.3 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.72 ($73.3 million divided by 101.8 million shares). 2) Following the closing of its acquisition of Orchid Cellmark Inc. (Orchid) in mid-December, the Company recorded a net $2.8 million loss on its divestiture of certain assets of Orchids U.S. government paternity business, under the terms of the agreement reached with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. This non- deductible loss on disposal was recorded in Other Income and Expense in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations and decreased net earnings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, by $2.8 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.03 ($2.8 million divided by 101.0 million shares and $2.8 million divided by 101.8 million shares, respectively). 3) During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $13.6 million, consisting of $14.8 million in professional fees and expenses associated with acquisitions, which are recorded in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations; offset by a net restructuring credit of $1.2 million, resulting from the reversal of unused severance and facility closure liabilities. The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2010, by $8.3 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.08 ($8.3 million divided by 104.5 million shares). During the first nine months of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $31.1 million ($19.1 million after tax), consisting of $10.9 million in professional fees and expenses associated with acquisitions; $7.0 million bridge financing fees (recorded as interest expense) associated with the signing of an asset purchase agreement for Genzyme Genetics; and $13.2 million severance related liabilities associated with workforce reduction initiatives For the year ended December 31, 2010, the after tax impact of these combined charges of $44.7 million decreased net earnings by $27.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.26 ($27.4 million divided by 105.4 million shares). 4) The Company continues to grow its business through acquisitions and uses Adjusted EPS Excluding Amortization as a measure of operational performance, growth and shareholder returns. The Company believes adjusting EPS for amortization will provide investors with better insight into the operating performance of the business. For the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, intangible amortization was $21.2 million and $19.6 million, respectively ($12.9 million and $12.0 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.13 ($12.9 million divided by 101.0 million shares) and $0.12 ($12.0 million divided by 104.5 million shares), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, intangible amortization was $85.8 million and $72.7 million respectively ($52.4 million and $44.5 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.51 ($52.4 million divided by 101.8 million shares) and $0.43 ($44.5 million divided by 105.4 million shares), respectively.

This net credit also includes charges of $1.7 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $0.9 million in facility- related costs primarily related to ongoing integration activities for Orchid and Genzyme Genetics. The after tax impact of the net credit increased net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, by $2.2 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.02 ($2.2 million divided by 99.1 million shares). 2) During the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $27.9 million.
