9 Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures - Footnotes Note: GENZYME GENETICS and its logo are trademarks of Genzyme Corporation and used by Esoterix Genetic Laboratories, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of LabCorp, under license. Esoterix Genetic Laboratories and LabCorp are operated independently from Genzyme Corporation. 1) During the second quarter of 2012, the Company recorded $3.4 million in restructuring and other special charges. The restructuring charges include $4.5 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $0.4 million in facility-related costs primarily associated with the ongoing integration of the Clearstone Central Laboratories acquisition and costs associated with the previously announced termination of an executive vice president. These charges were partially offset by the reversal of previously established restructuring reserves of $1.5 million. The Company recorded $0.9 million in acquisition fees and expenses relating to its planned acquisition of MEDTOX Scientific, Inc, which was recorded in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Companys Statement of Operations. As part of the Clearstone integration, the Company also recorded a $6.9 million loss on the disposal of one of its European subsidiaries. In addition, in conjunction with the liquidation of one of its joint ventures, the Company recorded a one-time increase of $2.9 million in equity method income. The after tax impact of these net charges decreased net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 by $7.8 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.08 ($7.8 million divided by 98.0 million shares). During the first quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a net credit of $3.6 million in restructuring and other special charges. The Company reversed previously established reserves of $3.8 million in unused severance and $2.4 million in unused facility-related costs. This net credit also includes charges of $1.7 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $0.9 million in facility-related costs primarily related to ongoing integration activities for Orchid and Genzyme Genetics. The after tax impact of the combined net charges decreased net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2012, by $5.6 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.06 ($5.6 million divided by 98.6 million shares). 2) During the second quarter of 2011, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $53.9 million. The restructuring charges include $7.5 million in net severance and other personnel costs along with $10.8 million in net facility-related costs primarily associated with the ongoing integration of the Genzyme Genetics and Westcliff acquisitions. The special charges also include $34.5 million ($49.5 million, net of previously recorded reserves of $15.0 million) relating to the settlement of the Hunter Labs litigation in California, along with $1.1 million for legal costs associated with the planned acquisition of Orchid Cellmark incurred during the quarter, both of which were recorded in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Companys Statement of Operations. The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, by $32.6 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.32 ($32.6 million divided by 102.8 million shares). During the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded restructuring and other special charges of $27.9 million. The charges included $4.0 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $9.8 million in facility-related costs associated with the integration of Genzyme Genetics. The charges also included a $14.8 million write-off of an investment made in a prior year. The after tax impact of these combined charges decreased net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2011, by $49.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.48 ($49.4 million divided by 102.6 million shares). 3) The Company continues to grow the business through acquisitions and uses Adjusted EPS Excluding Amortization as a measure of operational performance, growth and shareholder returns. The Company believes adjusting EPS for amortization provides investors with better insight into the operating performance of the business. For the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, intangible amortization was $20.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively ($12.5 million and $13.1 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.13 ($12.5 million divided by 98.0 million shares) and $0.12 ($13.0 million divided by 102.8 million shares), respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, intangible amortization was $42.0 million and $43.4 million, respectively ($25.7 million and $26.5 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.26 ($25.7 million divided by 98.6 million shares) and $0.26 ($26.5 million divided by 102.6 million shares), respectively.
