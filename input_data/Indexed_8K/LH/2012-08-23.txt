Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 19, 2010, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (the "Company") entered into an Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture"). On August 23, 2012, the Company entered into supplemental indentures to the Indenture under which the Company issued $1 billion in debt securities, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.20% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes," and collectively with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"). The 2017 Notes were issued pursuant to the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 23, 2012, under the Indenture (the "2017 Notes Supplemental Indenture") and the 2022 Notes were issued pursuant to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 23, 2012, under the Indenture (the "2022 Notes Supplemental Indenture, and collectively with the 2017 Notes Supplemental Indenture, the "Supplemental Indentures").
The Notes were issued in a public offering pursuant to the Company's effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178428) and the base prospectus included in that registration statement as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated August 20, 2012, as filed August 22, 2012 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the base prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, the "Prospectus"). The terms of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures, and the Notes are described in the section of the Prospectus entitled Debt Securities, as supplemented by the section entitled Description of the Notes, and those sections of the Prospectus are incorporated in this Form 8-K by reference.
The Company expects that the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be approximately $991.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated expenses of the offering. Net proceeds will be used to repay approximately $625 million of the outstanding borrowings under the Company's existing credit facility dated December 21, 2011, and for general corporate purposes.
A copy of the Indenture is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Report. A copy of each of the Supplemental Indentures, including the forms of the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes as thereto, are filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2 and Exhibit 4.3, respectively.

The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(b) To prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Notes and the offering thereof, in the form approved by you and attached as Schedule IV hereto and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
(c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus
 
as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(e) In the ordinary course of filing its periodic reports, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.

(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the
 
Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and as at June 30, 2012 carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and the Audit, Compensation, Quality and Compliance and Nominating and Governance committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to December 31, 2011, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
(1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;
(2) with respect to the period subsequent to June 30, 2012, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or common stock of the Company or decreases in the shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the June 30, 2012 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from July 1, 2012 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding quarter; in net sales, operating income, earnings before income taxes or in total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the
 
significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary  Summary Consolidated Financial Data" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
 
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, on the Closing Date.
7. . If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Notes.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Notes and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Notes, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
provided
however
 
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an
provided
however
 
Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and

As Representatives of the several Underwriters
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This firm has acted as counsel to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance of $[            ] aggregate principal amount of the Company's [    ]% Senior Notes due [                    ], 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $[            ] aggregate principal amount of the Company's [    ]% Senior Notes due [                    ], 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August [    ], 2012 (the "Indenture") among the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and, in the case of the 2017 Notes, the Supplemental Indenture for the 2017 Notes dated as of August [    ], 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Indenture, the "2017 Notes Indenture") and, in the case of the 2022 Notes, the Supplemental Indenture for the 2022 Notes dated as of August [    ], 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Indenture, the "2022 Notes Indenture" and, collectively with the 2017 Notes Indenture, the "Notes Indentures"), and the sale of the Notes pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated August [    ], 2012 (the "Agreement") among the Company and you, as Representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"). This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 6(b)(i) of the Agreement in connection with the Closing thereunder on the date hereof. Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Agreement have the meanings set forth in the Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein (including in attached hereto). Certain other capitalized terms used herein are defined in attached hereto.
Schedule 1
Schedule 1
For purposes of the opinions, which are set forth in paragraphs (a) through (m) below (the "Opinions"), and other statements made in this letter, we have examined copies of the documents
listed on attached hereto (the "Documents"). We believe the Documents provide an appropriate basis on which to render the opinions hereinafter expressed.
Schedule 1
In our examination of the Agreement and the other Documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all of the Documents, the authenticity of all originals of the Documents and the conformity to authentic originals of all of the Documents submitted to us as copies (including telecopies). As to all matters of fact relevant to the Opinions and other statements made herein, we have relied on the representations and statements of fact made in the Documents, we have not independently established the facts so relied on, and we have not made any investigation or inquiry other than our examination of the Documents. The Opinions are given, and other statements are made, in the context of the foregoing.
As used in this opinion letter, the phrase "to our knowledge" means the actual knowledge (that is, the conscious awareness of facts or other information) of (a) lawyers currently in the firm who have given substantive legal attention to representation of the Company in connection with the Agreement and (2) other lawyers currently in the firm who have given substantive legal attention to representation of the Company and with whom we have deemed it appropriate to consult.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has all requisite power and authority under all applicable laws, regulations and governing documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes Indentures, and has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce the Indenture and the Notes Indentures, against the Company, (ii) the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture and the Notes Indentures, (iii) The Trustee and the Company are validly existing and in good standing in all necessary jurisdictions (except for the Company in the State of Delaware), (iv) the Indenture and the Notes Indentures each constitute a valid and binding obligation, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, (v) there has been no mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, or fraud, duress or undue influence, in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Indenture or the Notes Indentures, and the conduct of all parties to the Indenture and the Notes Indentures has complied with any requirements of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability, and (vi) there are and have been no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is and has been no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties, that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Indenture or either of the Notes Indentures. We have also assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter.
For purposes of the opinions set forth in paragraphs (k) and (m) below, we have assumed that all orders, judgments, decrees, agreements and contracts would be interpreted in accordance with their plain meaning and that the meaning of terms in such agreements and contracts would be what lawyers generally understand them to mean under Applicable State Law, notwithstanding that such agreements and contracts may be governed by the laws of a different jurisdiction.
The Opinions are based as to matters of law solely on applicable provisions of the following, as currently in effect: (i) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation Act"), (ii) as to the opinions expressed in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (k)(ii), subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, internal New York law ("Applicable State Law"), (iii) as to the opinions expressed in paragraphs (e) and (i) the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, (iv) as to the opinions expressed in paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, (v) as to the opinions expressed in paragraph (j), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, (vi) as to the opinion expressed in paragraph (l), the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and (vii) as to the opinion expressed in paragraph (k)(ii), subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, federal statutes and regulations ("Applicable Federal Law").
Based upon, subject to and limited by the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions, and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, we are of the opinion that:
(a) The Company is validly existing as a corporation and in good standing as of the date of the Good Standing Certificate under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(b) The Company has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes Indentures, and to own, lease and operate its current properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
(c) The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company. The Notes, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the manner provided for in the Indenture and the applicable Notes Indenture, and the Agreement, against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and the applicable Notes Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
(d) The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(e) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and the Indenture and the Notes Indentures have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
(f) The Notes, the Indenture and the Notes Indentures conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes."
(g) The information in the Prospectus under the captions "Debt Securities," "Description of the Notes" and "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations", to the extent that such information constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by us and is correct in all material respects.
(h) Based solely upon our review of the information regarding the Company provided through the EDGAR system on the Commission's website, the Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission. The required filings of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act have been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b).
(i) At the time the Registration Statement became effective and at the date hereof, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein and the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 of the Trustee, as to which we express no opinion), excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder.
(j) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act (other than the financial statements and schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion), at the time they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the regulations thereunder.
(k) The execution, delivery and performance on the date hereof by the Company of the Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes Indentures and the Notes do not (i) violate the Corporation Act, or the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, (ii) violate any provision of Applicable Federal Law or any provision of Applicable State Law, or (iii) violate any of the Company Orders.
(l) The Company is not, and immediately following the issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
(m) To our knowledge, except as otherwise described in the Registration Statement, there are no persons with registration or other similar rights to have any securities registered under the Registration Statement, or to require the Company to file any other registration statement, as a result of the offer and sale of the Notes.
The opinions expressed in Paragraphs (c) and (e) above with respect to the enforceability of the Notes, the Indenture and the Notes Indentures, shall be understood to mean only that if there is a default in performance of an obligation, (i) if a failure to pay or other damage can be shown and (ii) if the defaulting party can be brought into a court which will hear the case and apply the governing law, then, subject to the availability of defenses, and to the exceptions elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, the court will provide a money damage (or perhaps injunctive or specific performance) remedy.
In addition to the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions and limitations elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, our opinions expressed above are also subject to the effect of: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory and other law regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers); and (ii) the exercise of judicial discretion and the application of principles of equity, good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, conscionability and materiality (regardless of whether the applicable agreements are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
Nothing herein shall be construed to cause us to be considered "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act.
We express no opinion in this letter as to any other laws and regulations not specifically identified above as being covered hereby (and in particular, we express no opinion as to any effect that such other laws and regulations may have on the opinions expressed herein). We
express no opinion in this letter as to federal or state securities laws or regulations (except to the extent stated in paragraphs (e), (i), (j) and (l)), antitrust, unfair competition, banking, or tax (except to the extent stated in paragraph (g)) laws or regulations, or laws or regulations of any political subdivision below the state level. The opinions set forth in paragraphs (c), (e), and (k) are based upon a review of only those laws and regulations (not otherwise excluded in this letter) that, in our experience, are generally recognized as applicable to transactions of the type contemplated in the Agreement.
We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the Closing under the Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, and should not be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without the prior written consent of this firm.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (the "Company"), a Delaware Corporation, and have acted as counsel in connection with the issuance of $[            ] aggregate principal amount of the Company's [    ]% Senior Notes due [                    ], 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $[            ] aggregate principal amount of the Company's [    ]% Senior Notes due [                    ], 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August [    ], 2012 (the "Indenture") among the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and, in the case of the 2017 Notes, the Supplemental Indenture for the 2017 Notes dated as of August [    ], 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Indenture, the "2017 Notes Indenture") and, in the case of the 2022 Notes, the Supplemental Indenture for the 2022 Notes dated as of August [    ], 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Indenture, the "2022 Notes Indenture" and, collectively with the 2017 Notes Indenture, the "Notes Indentures"), and the sale of the Notes pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated August [    ], 2012 (the "Agreement") among the Company and you, as Representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"). This opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 6(b)(iii) of the Agreement in connection with the Closing thereunder on the date hereof. Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Agreement have the meanings set forth in the Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.
In rendering the opinions set forth below, I, or lawyers under my supervision, have examined (i) an executed copy of the Agreement, (ii) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-178428) (such registration statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Registration Statement"), (iii) the Base Prospectus, dated December 9,
2011 and the Final Prospectus, dated August [    ], 2012 (together, the "Prospectus"), (iv) the Indenture and the Notes Indentures and (v) the Disclosure Package. In addition, I have examined copies of such other records and documents of the Company, copies of public documents, certificates of officers of the Company and public officials, and such other documents as I have deemed necessary and appropriate as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of the Company), the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all corporate records, documents, instruments and certificates submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original corporate records, documents, instruments and certificates of all corporate records, documents instruments and certificates submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. As to questions of fact material to my opinions, I have relied upon the factual matters contained in the representations and warranties of the Company and upon statements and/or certificates of officers of the Company.
I have further assumed that you have the power and authority and have taken the corporate action necessary to perform the services required by you in the Agreement, and that no approvals, waivers, filings, notices or consents, governmental or non-governmental, are required for the valid execution, delivery and performance by you of the Agreement, and that the Agreement constitutes your legal, valid and binding obligation.
As used in this letter, the phrase "to my knowledge" means my actual knowledge. Nothing herein shall be construed to cause me to be considered an "expert" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws and regulations of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth above and hereinafter, I am of the opinion that:
(a) The Company and each subsidiary (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (iii) is duly qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and the capital stock of each subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free from liens, encumbrances and defects or any other security interest.
(b) The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes Indentures by the Company (i) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate and, if required, stockholder action of the Company and (ii) will not violate (A) any
provision of law, statute, rule or regulation of the United States of America or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL") or of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Company or any subsidiary, (B) any order of any federal governmental agency or state governmental agency or (C) to my actual knowledge, any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is bound, the effect of which could reasonably be expected to (1) result in a Material Adverse Effect or would adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Indenture, the Notes Indentures or the Agreement, or would otherwise be material in the context of the sale of the Notes, (2) to my actual knowledge, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right to accelerate or to require the prepayment, repurchase or redemption of any obligation under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument, the effect of which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or would adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Indenture, the Notes Indentures or the Agreement, or would otherwise be material in the context of the sale of the Notes or (3) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property or assets now owned by the Company or any subsidiary.
(c) No action, consent or approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by any court, federal governmental agency or body, or to the extent required under state law, any state governmental agency, is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes Indentures, except for (i) such as have been obtained under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and any applicable state securities or blue sky laws and (ii) such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders or filings that have been obtained.
(d) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, to my actual knowledge, there are not any actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity or by or before any federal governmental agency or state governmental agency now pending or threatened against or affecting the Company or any subsidiary that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Indenture, the Notes Indentures or the Agreement or which are otherwise material in the context of the sale of the Notes.
I am a member of the bar of Illinois and do not express any opinion as to matters governed by any other laws other than the Federal laws of the United States of America and the GCL. This opinion is rendered only with respect to laws, and rules, regulations and orders thereunder, which are currently in effect.
I assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the closing under the Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, nor be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without my prior written consent.

Dated:
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of debt securities of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), designated as the 2.20% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") issued under an Indenture dated as of November 19, 2010, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated August 23, 2012 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall be entitled, without notice to or consent of the Holders, to issue additional debt securities under the Indenture on the same terms and conditions as the Notes (except for the interest accrual date and first Interest Payment Date) in accordance with the Indenture. The Notes and any additional debt securities will be treated as a single series of debt securities for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to create Liens on assets and engage in Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The Indenture also contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company's Subsidiaries from incurring Indebtedness or issuing Preferred Stock. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
 
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Company shall pay interest semi-annually on February 23 and August 23 of each year, commencing February 23, 2013. Interest on the Notes shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from August 23, 2012. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes plus 1% per annum, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.
 
The Company shall pay interest on the Notes (except Defaulted Interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Notes at the close of business on the February 8 or August 8 next preceding the Interest Payment Date even if the Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Notes represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company shall make all payments in respect of a certificated Note (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided that payments on a certificated Note will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
 
Initially, U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Security Registrar or co-Security Registrar without notice.

Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at his registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of, which shall include accrued interest on, all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other
 
conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in paragraph 5 of the Note, the Company shall make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in multiples of $1,000 principal amount) of that Holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this paragraph 6, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the provisions of this paragraph 6 and all other provisions of the Indenture applicable to the Change of Control repurchase provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
 
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000.
The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the outstanding Notes of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, nor (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Notes of any series or portions thereof called for redemption.

Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest on the Notes that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of debt securities of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), designated as the 3.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") issued under an Indenture dated as of November 19, 2010, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated August 23, 2012 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall be entitled, without notice to or consent of the Holders, to issue additional debt securities under the Indenture on the same terms and conditions as the Notes (except for the interest accrual date and first Interest Payment Date) in accordance with the Indenture. The Notes and any additional debt securities will be treated as a single series of debt securities for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to create Liens on assets and engage in Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The Indenture also contains a covenant that limits the ability of the Company's Subsidiaries from incurring Indebtedness or issuing Preferred Stock. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
 
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Company shall pay interest semi-annually on February 23 and August 23 of each year, commencing February 23, 2013. Interest on the Notes shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from August 23, 2012. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes plus 1% per annum, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.

Holders must surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Notes represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company shall make all payments in respect of a certificated Note (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided that payments on a certificated Note will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
 
Initially, U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar.

Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at his registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount
 
may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of, which shall include accrued interest on, all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in paragraph 5 of the Note, the Company shall make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in multiples of $1,000 principal amount) of that Holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this paragraph 6, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the provisions of this paragraph 6 and all other provisions of the Indenture applicable to the Change of Control repurchase provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000.
The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control, which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies.
