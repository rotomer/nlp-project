     In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216, the following information, which is intended to be furnished under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition," is instead being furnished under Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure." The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made by Invitrogen Corporation (the "Company") whether before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

     Certain of the information set forth in the press release may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has regularly reported pro forma results which exclude merger related amortization and business integration costs to provide a supplemental comparison of results of operations. Management excludes these costs when analyzing operations since they are principally non-cash or other costs resulting primarily from business restructurings or purchase accounting that are separate from ongoing operations. Management also believes that the pro forma results provide investors with additional useful information concerning the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows. The pro forma results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The second quarter revenue growth of 17% included 7% from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cell culture revenues increased 30% in the second quarter as sales for both research and production applications posted strong increases. Favorable foreign currency rates accounted for 8% of the increase. Sales of molecular biology products increased 10% in the second quarter of 2003 compared with the same period in 2002. Favorable foreign currency rates accounted for 6% of the increase.
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 grew 15%, of which 7% resulted from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. For the same period, cell culture revenues increased 27% reflecting strong increases for both research and production applications aided by an 8% impact from favorable foreign currency rates. Sales of molecular biology products increased 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2003 versus the same period in 2002. The increase includes 6% from favorable foreign currency rates.
Second quarter 2003 gross margins were 62%, compared with 59% in the second quarter of 2002. Molecular biology gross margins increased to 69% in the second quarter of 2003 from 62% last year. Price increases, cost improvements and favorable changes in currency rates were the principal reasons for the increase. Second quarter molecular biology gross margins also included a $1.7 million benefit from the reversal of previously accrued royalty expense. This benefit occurred when it was determined that certain products were not subject to license agreements. Cell culture gross margins decreased to 52% from 53% in the comparable quarter of 2002, principally due to lower gross margins on serum products.
Operating income was 13% of revenues in the second quarter of 2003 versus 7% for the second quarter of 2002. Higher business integration expenses in 2002 related to the closure of the company's Huntsville, Alabama operations and the Life Technologies integration account for the increase in the operating income percentage.
Operating income before business integration costs and merger-related amortization was 24% of revenues in the second quarter of 2003 compared with 26% in the second quarter of 2002. Research and development expenses increased 64% as the company increased its investment in R&D to 6.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2003 compared with 4.7% of sales in the second quarter of 2002.
Investment income was $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, and was $1.0 million lower than in the same quarter of 2002 due to lower investment balances and rates of return. Other income (expense), net, was a gain in the second quarter of 2003 compared with a loss in 2002 as the company recognized a deferred gain on a previously sold business in 2003 compared with losses on sold businesses in 2002.
Cash flows from operating activities were $36 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $62 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Capital expenditures were $7 million during the second quarter of 2003 and $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. No cash has been used to repurchase Company shares in 2003.
