In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statement of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Molecular Probes, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at September 30, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Basis of Presentation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Molecular Probes, Inc. ("Molecular Probes") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Molecular Probes Europe ("MPE") and Interfacial Dynamics Corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim financial statements have been prepared, without audit, according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods indicated. Molecular Probes' fiscal year ends September 30. The unaudited balance sheet as of September 30, 2002 is derived from the audited balance sheet included in Exhibit 99.1 herein.
     These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in Exhibit 99.1 herein.
Revenue Recognition
     Molecular Probes records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
      Molecular Probes' business practice requires written or electronic documentation or evidence from a customer to support a sales or licensing arrangement or grant contract.
Pursuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
      Revenue from product sales is recognized in the period the product is shipped. Products are shipped Freight on Board shipping point. Once those terms are met, Molecular Probes has no continuing obligations or performance criteria requirements. Molecular Probes has no "bill and hold" arrangements with customers.
Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered
     Research and development grant and contract revenues are recognized in accordance with the terms of the related agreements, generally as qualified research activities progress. Payments received for future performances are deferred and recorded as revenue when earned.
     License fees are recognized when there is no material continuing performance obligation under the agreement. Up-front payments are deferred and recorded as revenue over the term of the agreement.
      Sales of Molecular Probes products are at fixed or established sales prices determined prior to the time the products are shipped with no customer cancellation, price protection or termination clauses.
Fixed or determinable price
      Based on Molecular Probes' credit management policies it believes collectibility is reasonably assured (1) when product is shipped to a customer; (2) as qualified research activities progress and revenues become billable under research and development grants and contracts; and (3) when there is no continuing performance obligations under licensing arrangements. Based on the Molecular Probes' historical experience, no provision for uncollectible accounts and return allowances are necessary at the time revenue is recognized.
Collectibility is reasonably assured
 
Employee Stock Option Plans
     Molecular Probes accounts for its employee stock option plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS No. 123). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the fixed stock option plans under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, , which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, , to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS No. 123's fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28, , to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effect of an entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income in annual and interim financial statements. Molecular Probes adopted SFAS No. 148 for the nine months ended June 30, 2003. The following table illustrates the effect on net income if Molecular Probes had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.
