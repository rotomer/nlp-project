The pro forma adjustments on the following unaudited pro forma combined financial statement are preliminary and have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the acquisition. Consequently, the amounts reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statement are subject to change, and the final amounts may differ substantially.

The pro forma combined financial statement should be read in conjunction with the separate historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of Invitrogen contained in the 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2004, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three month period ended March 31, 2004, filed on May 10, 2004, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six month period ended June 30, 2004, filed on August 9, 2004, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, filed on November 5, 2004, and the Forms 8-K/A filed on October 31, 2003, June 10, 2003, April 21, 2004, May 25, 2004, and September 2, 2004, and the audited financial statements of BioReliance included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K/A filed on April 21, 2004.

The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, illustrates the effect of the acquisition of BioReliance as if it had occurred on January 1, 2004, and includes the historical unaudited results of operations for BioReliance for the period from January 1, 2004, through February 6, 2004, combined with Invitrogen's unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, which give effect to the acquisition of BioReliance Corporation as of February 6, 2004.
 
2. Pro Forma Adjustments and Assumptions for BioReliance
 
On February 6, 2004, Invitrogen acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock and stock options of BioReliance Corporation (BioReliance) for a cash purchase price of $433.3 million, plus assumed outstanding debt of $70.4 million and transaction costs of $4.9 million.
 
The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on management's estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the acquisition. Additionally, a final valuation of acquired purchased technology and assessment of useful lives has not yet been completed, which may affect the final allocation of the purchase price to these assets and the related amortization expense. Consequently, the amounts reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income are subject to change, and the final amounts may differ substantially.
 
 
Eliminates intercompany sales of $58,000, intercompany cost of sales of $24,000, and intercompany purchases used in research and development of $34,000.
 
 
Reclassify selling, general and administrative expenses to sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense to conform to Invitrogen's expense classifications.
 
 
 
Increases purchase intangibles amortization expense by $0.4 million for the acquired purchased intangibles. The amortization of the purchased intangibles, which is preliminary and may change significantly upon completion of the valuation of the intangible assets acquired, is based on a weighted average life of 4 years.
 
 
Decreases business integration and merger costs for non-recurring expenses directly attributable to the purchase transaction.
 
 
Adjustments to interest and other income, net, are as follows:
 
 
 
Adjust the income tax provision on the pro forma combined pretax income by $0.3 million to amounts equal to the weighted average of Invitrogen's pro forma effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and BioReliance's historical effective tax rate for the period from January 1, 2004 through February 6, 2004.
