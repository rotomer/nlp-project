Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
. On February 8, 2005 at a meeting of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") the Committee approved an amendment to the Company's 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2005 Incentive Plan"). Specifically, the 2005 Incentive Plan was amended to provide:
Amendment to 2005 Incentive Plan
 
 
 
The Committee's approval of the terms of this amendment to the 2005 Incentive Plan shall not be deemed to create an enforceable agreement between the Company and any eligible participant, and the Committee retains discretion to make changes in the plan design and plan participation at any time without prior notice to any eligible participant. No rights to any cash awards shall be deemed to exist unless and until the Committee or, with respect to non-executive officers, the Company, authorizes payment of any awards under the 2005 Incentive Plan following the completion of any fiscal year measurement periods and only after each eligible participant has satisfied the 2005 Incentive Plan's applicable participation requirements. A summary of this amendment to the 2005 Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
. On February 9, 2005, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company approved an amendment to its non-employee director equity compensation program. The amendment to the equity compensation program changed the number and type of equity awards issued to new non-employee directors.
Non-employee Director Compensation
 
The amended non-employee director equity compensation program provides that for any new director added to the Board after the date of this amendment, the Board anticipates that each director will receive an initial grant of 7,000 stock options and 1,000 restricted stock units, pro rated from the date of appointment to the date of the next annual meeting. The Board granted options and restricted stock units to Dr. Reynolds pursuant to the amended program. The initial stock options and initial restricted stock units shall vest over a 12-month period, vesting one-twelfth per month and becoming fully vested on the anniversary of the date of grant. The stock options will be granted at an exercise price equal to the current fair market value of our common stock. The restricted stock units will only be settled, to the extent vested, by issuance of one share of our common stock for each unit, upon the termination of the director's service to the Company. Both the stock options and the restricted stock units will become vested (and settled to the extent applicable) upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company. In addition, as a result of this amendment to the Company's non-employee director equity compensation program, the Board anticipates that each non-employee director will also receive, on an annual basis, 7,000 stock options and 1,000 restricted stock units. It is anticipated that the terms and conditions of these annual awards shall be identical to the initial awards described above. The Form of Non-employee Director Stock Option Agreement and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are hereby incorporated by reference.
 
All non-employee directors will continue to receive the following cash compensation for service on the Board:
 
Payments are made in advance on a quarterly basis on or about January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1. On each payment date, each director shall receive 25% of the single highest Annual Retainer applicable for his or her status as reflected in the table above. Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect partial quarter service and a director's change in status.
 
The Company reimburses all non-employee directors for expenses incurred to attend meetings of the Board or its committees, promptly after such expense is incurred.
 
A copy of the summary sheet outlining the current terms of director compensation is filed as Exhibit 99.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Right to Exercise.
 
4.2 Exercise of the Option shall be by written notice to the Company which must state the election to exercise the Option, the number of whole shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised and such other representations and agreements as to the Optionee's investment intent with respect to such shares as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Option Agreement.

Forms of Consideration Authorized.
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company of shares of Stock to the extent such tender of Stock would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company's stock. The Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.

Cashless Exercise
 
4.4 At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Optionee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (i) the exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option, (ii) the transfer, in whole or in part, of any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option, (iii) the operation of any law or regulation providing for the imputation of interest, or (iv) the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option.

THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. Questions concerning this restriction should be directed to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

17.2 The Plan is discretionary in nature, and the Company may amend, cancel or terminate the Plan in its sole discretion at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable limitations imposed by law. The grant of stock options under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of stock options or benefits in lieu of stock options in the future.
