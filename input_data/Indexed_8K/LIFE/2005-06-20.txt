Item 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
The Agreement
 
On June 14, 2005, Invitrogen Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Initial Purchasers") for the purchase of $325 million of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The Company also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes to cover over-allotments. The Initial Purchasers exercised this option in full on June 15, 2005. The sale of the Notes closed on June 20, 2005. The Company sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers under an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Initial Purchasers re-sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Both the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the initial sale of the Notes and the Rule 144A exemption for their resale are available based upon the representations of the Initial Purchasers in the Agreement that, among other things, the Initial Purchasers would offer the Notes for resale solely to "Qualified Institutional Buyers," as defined by Rule 144A, and in compliance with the other provisions of Rule 144A. The Company sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers at a 2% discount from the initial $325 million, equivalent to $6.5 million. Including the exercise of the over-allotment option, the total size of the offering of the Notes is $350 million, and the net proceeds to Company of the offering after discounts and other expenses is approximately $343 million.
 
The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and conditions to closing. The Agreement also contains customary indemnification and contribution provisions whereby the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other, have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, the parties entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will register the Notes and the underlying shares of the Company's common stock for resale on a shelf registration statement. If the Company fails to timely file or have such shelf registration statement declared effective, the Company will be required to pay additional interest on the Notes. The Company has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to issue any of its common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for its common stock for a period of 90 days without the consent of UBS Securities LLC.
 
The Notes
 
. The rights of the Notes are set forth in an indenture that the Company, the Initial Purchasers and U.S. Bank as trustee executed at the Closing of the sale of the Notes. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the Notes may be required to be paid per six month period beginning June 15, 2011 if the market value of the Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the Notes' principal value. The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020. Prepayment of amounts due under the Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the Notes' principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, the Company's default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in the Notes or indenture, or upon cross-default by the Company or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of other debt of the Company or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50 million.
Interest payments, redemption and acceleration
 
. The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of 10.1780 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $98.25 per share), only under certain circumstances. Such circumstances include the closing sale price of the Company's stock exceeding 125% of the conversion price for a specified period, the trading price of the Notes being below 97% of the conversion value of the Notes during a specified period, certain corporate transactions occurring or the Company calling the Notes for redemption.
Conditions to conversion
 
. Upon conversion, the Company will only issue shares of its common stock if and only to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the Notes, where conversion value is the conversion rate then in effect multiplied by the market price of the Company's common stock price for a specified period. The Company will deliver cash upon conversion for the lesser of the conversion value or the principal amount of the Notes.
Settlement upon conversion
. If Notes are surrendered for conversion in connection with certain fundamental changes that occur before June 15, 2011, holders may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate for Notes surrendered for conversion in connection with such fundamental changes unless the Company elects to change its conversion obligation to provide for conversion of the Notes into shares of an acquiring company's common stock.
Adjustment of conversion rate

Such description is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the indenture, which the Company expects to file with the SEC.

Agreements of the Company

(c) If, at any time prior to the completion of the resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which, in the opinion of counsel to the Initial Purchasers, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when such Offering Memorandum is delivered to an Eligible Purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel to the Initial Purchasers, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum to comply with any applicable law, forthwith to prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement to such Offering Memorandum so that the statements therein, as so amended or supplemented, will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that such Offering Memorandum will comply with applicable law, and to furnish to the Initial Purchasers and such other persons as the Initial Purchasers may designate such number of copies thereof as the Initial Purchasers may reasonably request.
 
(d) Prior to the sale of all Notes pursuant to Exempt Resales as contemplated hereby, to cooperate with the Initial Purchasers and counsel to the Initial Purchasers in connection with the registration or qualification of the Notes for offer and sale to the Initial Purchasers and pursuant to Exempt Resales under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Initial Purchasers may reasonably request and to continue such registration or qualification in effect so long as required for Exempt Resales and to file such consents to service of process or other documents as may be necessary in order to effect such registration or qualification; , that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general consent to service of process or taxation other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Offering Memorandum or Exempt Resales, in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so subject.

The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
 
such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
 
(d) The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (c) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by such Initial Purchaser and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
 
(e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Notes. The Company and each Initial Purchaser agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, or in connection with the Offering Document.
 
9. . The several obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Firm Notes under this Agreement on the Closing Date and the Additional Notes, if any, on any Option Closing Date are subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions.

Effectiveness of Agreement and Termination
 
If on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase the Notes which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date by all Initial Purchasers, each non-defaulting Initial Purchaser shall be obligated severally, in the proportion which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which all the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, as the case may be, have agreed to purchase, or in such other proportion as you may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers, as the case may be, agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which any Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-tenth of such principal amount of the Notes without the written consent of such Initial Purchaser. If on the Closing Date, or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase the Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased by all Initial Purchasers and arrangements satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers and the Company for purchase of such the Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of
provided
 
any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser and the Company. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, or such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of any such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.
 
11. .

Miscellaneous
 
The respective indemnities, contribution agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers; the officers or directors of the Initial Purchasers, any person controlling the Initial Purchasers, the Company, the officers or directors of the Company, or any person controlling the Company, (ii) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder and (iii) termination of the Agreement.
 
If for any reason the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than as a result of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10), the Company agrees to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Company shall be liable for all expenses which it has agreed to pay pursuant to Section 5(h) hereof. The Company also agrees to reimburse the Initial Purchasers and its officers, directors and each person, if any, who controls such Initial Purchasers within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act for any and all fees and expenses (including without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by them in connection with enforcing their rights under this Agreement (including without limitation its rights under Section 8).
 
Except as otherwise provided, this Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Company, the Initial Purchasers, the Initial Purchasers' directors and officers, any controlling persons referred to herein, the directors of the Company and their respective successors and assigns, all as and to the extent provided in this Agreement, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser of any of the Securities from the Initial Purchasers merely because of such purchase.
 
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
Each of UBS (on behalf of the Initial Purchasers) and the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 
This Agreement may be signed in various counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
Please confirm that the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement among the Company, and the Initial Purchasers.
