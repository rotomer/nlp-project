Item 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
The Indenture
 
On June 20, 2005, Invitrogen Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Indenture (the "Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee regarding the Company's 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The sale of the Notes closed on June 20, 2005. The Company sold the Notes to UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Initial Purchasers"), pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") between the parties. The Company sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers at a 2% discount from the face value of the Notes, equivalent to $7 million. Including the exercise of the over-allotment option, the total size of the offering of the Notes is $350 million, and the net proceeds to Company of the offering after discounts and other expenses is $343 million.
 
. The Indenture sets forth the rights and governing provisions of the Notes. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the Notes may be required to be paid per six month period beginning June 15, 2011 if the market value of the Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the Notes' principal value. The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Prepayment of amounts due under the Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the Notes' principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, the Company's default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in the Notes or indenture, or upon cross-default by the Company or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of other debt of the Company or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50 million.
Interest payments, redemption and acceleration
 
. The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of 10.1780 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $98.25 per share), only under certain circumstances. Such circumstances include the closing sale price of the Company's stock exceeding 125% of the conversion price for a specified period, the trading price of the Notes being below 97% of the conversion value of the Notes during a specified period, certain corporate transactions or fundamental changes occurring or the Company calling the Notes for redemption.
Conditions to conversion
 
. Upon conversion, the Company will only issue shares of its common stock if and only to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the Notes, where conversion value is the conversion rate then in effect multiplied by the market price of the Company's common stock price for a specified period. The Company will deliver cash upon conversion for the lesser of the conversion value or the principal amount of the Notes.
Settlement upon conversion
 
. If Notes are surrendered for conversion in connection with certain fundamental changes that occur before June 15, 2011, holders may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate for Notes surrendered for conversion in connection with such fundamental changes unless the Company elects to change its conversion obligation to provide for conversion of the Notes into shares of an acquiring company's common stock.
Adjustment of conversion rate

Such description is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Indenture, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the terms of the Purchase Agreement between the Company and the Initial Purchasers, dated June 14, 2005, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 20, 2005.
 
The Registration Rights Agreement
 
On June 20, 2005, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, at the cost to the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) file, within 90 days of the date of the Registration Rights Agreement, a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Notes for new exchange notes having terms
identical in all material respects to the Notes (except that the exchange notes will not contain transfer restrictions); (ii) to cause a shelf registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the closing date of the offering of the Notes of June 20, 2005; and (iii) to cause the registration statement to be effective continuously for a period of up to two years from the date of original issuance of the Notes or such shorter period that will terminate when (a) all the transfer restricted securities covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold pursuant to the shelf registration statement, (b) the date on which, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, all of the transfer restricted securities then held by the holders may be sold by such holders in the public United States securities markets in the absence of a registration statement covering such sales or (c) the date on which there ceases to be outstanding any transfer restricted securities.
 
The above description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

provided

distribution of the Notes and shall make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; , that the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 4(m) that would, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, violate applicable law or to include information the disclosure of which at the time would have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries, as determined in good faith by the Company.
provided, however
 
(n) The Company shall enter into such agreements and take all other reasonably appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities, and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification and contribution provisions and procedures no less favorable than those set forth in Section 7 (or such other provisions and procedures acceptable to the Majority Holders), with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to Section 7.
 
(o) The Company shall upon receipt of a reasonable request in writing therefor:
 
(i) make reasonably available at reasonable times prior to the effectiveness of the related Shelf Registration Statement for inspection by representatives of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities to be registered thereunder and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such Holders, at the office where normally kept during normal business hours, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders' attorneys, accountants or other agents in connection with any such Shelf Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations; , that the foregoing inspection and information gathering shall be coordinated by one counsel designated by the Holders and that such persons shall first agree in writing with the Company that any information that is designated in writing by the Company, in good faith, as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by such person, unless such disclosure is made in connection with a court proceeding or required by law, or such information becomes available to the public generally or through a third party without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality;
provided, however
 
(ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders), addressed to each selling Holder named in the Shelf Registration Statement covering such matters (in form, scope and substance) as those matters set forth in Section 9(e) of the Purchase Agreement;
 
(iii) obtain "cold comfort" letters (or, in the case of any person that does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of a "cold comfort" letter specified in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72, an "agreed-upon procedures letter") and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are,
 
or are required to be, included in the Shelf Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and
 
(iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders, including those to evidence compliance with Section 4(h).

(p) The Company may offer securities of the Company other than the Notes under the Shelf Registration Statement, except where such offer would conflict with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
 
SECTION 5. HOLDERS' AGREEMENTS

If a Supplemental Delay Period should occur, the Shelf Registration Period shall be extended by the number of days of which the Supplemental Delay Period is comprised; that the Shelf Registration Period shall not be extended if the Company has received an opinion of counsel (which counsel, if different from counsel to the Company referred to in Section 9(e) of the Purchase Agreement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders of the Transfer Restricted Securities named in the Shelf Registration Period and which opinion shall be in writing) to the effect that the Transfer Restricted Securities can be freely tradable without the continued effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement.
provided
 
(c) If so directed by the Company in a notice of the commencement of a Supplemental Delay Period, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering the Transfer Restricted Securities.
 
(d) Sales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement shall only be made in the manner set forth in such currently effective Shelf Registration Statement.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7(d), the Holders shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
(e) The agreements contained in this Section 7 shall survive the sale of the securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

In connection with any offer to purchase or purchase of Securities under Section 3.9, the Company shall (a) comply with Rule 13e-4 and Rule 14e-1 (or any successor to either such Rule), if applicable, under the Exchange Act, (b) file the related Schedule TO (or any successor or similar schedule, form or report) if required under the Exchange Act, and (c) otherwise comply with all federal and state securities laws in connection with such offer to purchase or purchase of Securities, all so as to permit the rights of the Holders and obligations of the Company under Section 3.9 to be exercised in the time and in the manner specified therein.
 
SECTION 3.11. REPAYMENT TO THE COMPANY.
 
To the extent that the aggregate amount of cash deposited by the Company pursuant to Section 3.9(c) exceeds the aggregate Change of Control Purchase Price, thereon of the Securities or portions thereof that the Company is obligated to purchase, then promptly after the Change of Control Purchase Date the Trustee or a Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess cash to the Company.
 
 
SECTION 4.1. CONVERSION PRIVILEGE.
 
(a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 4, a Holder of a Security shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000) of such Security into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of conversion as follows:
 
(i) during any fiscal quarter (after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005) if the Sale Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 consecutive Trading Days in the Measurement Period of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 125% of the Conversion Price in effect on the last Trading Day of such Measurement Period (in the event that the Conversion Price on such last Trading Day of such Measurement Period is not the same as the Conversion Price in effect for each of the Trading Days in such Measurement Period, the Conversion Agent shall make such adjustments as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate in determining whether the foregoing condition has been met);
 
(ii) during any five consecutive Trading Day period immediately following any five consecutive Trading Day period (the "") in which the average Market Price per $1,000 principal amount of Securities during such Securities Measurement Period was less than 97% of the average Single Day Conversion Value during such Securities Measurement Period; or
Securities Measurement Period
 
(iii) at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date, if such Security has been called for redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof.
 
The Conversion Agent shall, on behalf of the Company, determine at the end of each applicable period whether the Securities shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in clause (i) or (ii) above and, if the Securities shall be so convertible, the Conversion Agent shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Trustee written notice thereof. Whenever the Securities shall become convertible pursuant to Section 4.1, the Company or, at the Company's request, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the Holders in writing of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section 4.2, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information and publish it on the Company's website. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice.
 
(b) In addition, in the event that:
 
(i)
 
(A) the Company issues to all holders of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them to purchase Common Stock (that are exercisable for not more than 60 days) at less than the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date such issuance is announced, other than pursuant to any Company shareholder's rights plan; or
 
(B) the Company distributes to all holders of Common Stock shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or non-cash assets, including securities (other than distributions of rights and warrants referenced in Section 4.1(b)(i)(A), dividends and distributions of Common Stock, and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash), which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company exceeding 15% of the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the declaration for such distribution;
 
then, in each case, the Company must notify, in writing, Holders of Securities of the occurrence of such an event at least 20 days prior to the Ex Date for any such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex Date or the date of announcement by the Company that the distribution will not take place. No adjustment shall be made to the ability of a Holder of Securities to convert if such Holder may participate in the distribution without conversion.
 
(ii) the Company (A) becomes party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or
 
other property, or (B) a Fundamental Change (including a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change) shall have occurred, a Holder may surrender the Securities for conversion into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock, at any time after the date which is on or before the 30
th
day after (1) the date a transaction (that is not also a Fundamental Change) pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(ii)(A) is announced, or (2) with respect to a Fundamental Change, the date of the mailing of the related Fundamental Change Company Notice under Section 3.9(a)(2). Subject to Section 4.4, if the Company becomes party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, then at the effective time of the transaction, the right to convert the Securities into Common Stock shall be changed into a right to convert such Securities into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property which the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted such Securities immediately prior to the transaction. If the transaction constitutes a Fundamental Change, the Holder shall also have the rights set forth in Section 3.9 above.
 
SECTION 4.2. CONVERSION PROCEDURE; CONVERSION RATE; FRACTIONAL SHARES.
 
(a) Subject to Sections 4.1(b)(ii), 4.4, and 4.5(f), each Security shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent into cash and, if applicable, fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate therefor.
 
If the aggregate Net Share Settlement Conversion Value of a Security is greater than the Principal Return of such Security (the excess, if any, of such Net Share Settlement Conversion Value over such Principal Return being herein referred to as the ""), the Company shall deliver, through the Conversion Agent, to the Holder of such Security a certificate for a number of shares of Common Stock (the "") equal to a fraction whose numerator is the Net Share Amount for such Security and whose denominator is Ten-Day Weighted Average Price Per Share; , that the Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock and shall instead deliver cash (in addition to any consideration otherwise payable upon such conversion) in an amount equal to the value of such fraction computed on the basis of such Ten-Day Weighted Average Price Per Share. The Company shall deliver: (i) such Principal Return, (ii) if applicable, such Net Shares, and (iii) if applicable, the Make-Whole Consideration, as soon as practicable following the date on which such Holder satisfies all the requirements for such conversion specified in this Article 4 and in paragraph 9 of the Securities.
Net Share Amount
Net Shares
provided, however
 
Subject to Section 4.5(f), if a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs and such Security is surrendered for conversion at any time on or before the 30th day after the date of the mailing of the related Fundamental Change Company Notice under Section 3.9(a)(2), in addition to the Principal Return and any Net Share Amount receivable upon conversion, a Holder shall receive from the Company, through the Conversion Agent, upon such conversion Make-Whole Consideration, as determined in accordance with, and in the manner and form as set forth in, Section 4.5.
 
No payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock or accrued interest or accrued and unpaid Contingent Interest, if any, on a converted Security, except as described in Section 4.10 hereof.
 
The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with any conversion of Securities, but instead shall make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Ten-Day Weighted Average Price Per Share of such Common Stock.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice exercising such Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with Sections 3.8(b) or 3.9(b) hereof, as the case may be, prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be.
 
(b) Before any Holder of a Security shall be entitled to convert the same pursuant to this Article 4, such Holder shall, in the case of Securities issued in global form, comply with the procedures of the Depository in effect at that time, and in the case of Certificated Securities, surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, and shall give written notice to the Company at said office or place in the form of the Conversion Notice attached to the Security (the "") that such Holder elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Security to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued.
Conversion Notice
 
Before any such conversion, a Holder also shall pay all funds required, if any, relating to interest on the Securities, as provided in Section 4.10, and all taxes or duties, if any, as provided in Section 4.9.
 
If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the amount of cash and the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, which shall be deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Security (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at said office or place to such Holder of a Security, or to such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates (other than in the case of Holders of Securities in book-entry form with the Depositary, which shares shall be delivered in accordance with the Depositary customary practices) for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock while the stock transfer books for such stock or the security register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or security register.
 
If shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of a Restricted Security are to be issued in the name of a Person other than the Holder of such Restricted Security, such Holder must deliver to the Conversion Agent a certification in substantially the form set forth in a Transfer Certificate dated the date of surrender of such Restricted Security and signed by such Holder, as to compliance with the restrictions on transfer applicable to such Restricted Security. The Company shall not be required to issue Common Stock upon conversion of any such Restricted Security to a Person other than the Holder if such Restricted Security is not so accompanied by a properly completed certification, and the Registrar shall not be required to register Common Stock upon conversion of any such Restricted Security in the name of a Person other than the Holder if such Restricted Security is not so accompanied by a properly completed certification.
 
(c) A Security shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of the surrender of such Security for conversion as provided above, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock, if any, issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such Common Stock as of the close of business on such date. Upon conversion, all obligations under the Securities so converted will be deemed satisfied, including with respect to any accrued and unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest, if any, and Special Interest, if any).
 
(d) In case any Certificated Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, upon the written order of the Company, authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 4.9 hereof), a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Certificated Securities.
 
SECTION 4.3. ADJUSTMENT OF CONVERSION RATE FOR COMMON STOCK.
 
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
 
(a) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, pay a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date next following the Record Date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction:
 
(1) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date fixed for such determination and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
 
(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date fixed for such determination.
 
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for such determination.
 
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 4.3(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased. In each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision or combination and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination. Such increase or reduction, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
(c) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issue rights or warrants for a period expiring within 60 days after the date of announcement of such issuance (other than any rights or warrants referred to in Section 4.3(d)), to all holders of its shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock), at a price per share (or having a conversion, exchange or exercise price per share) less than the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the announcement of such issuance (treating the conversion, exchange or exercise price per share of the securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock as equal to the quotient of (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction:
 
(1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities so offered are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable); and
 
(2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the number of shares (or convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities) which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares (or convertible, exchangeable or exercisable securities) so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion, exchange or exercise price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the announcement of such issuance (determined by multiplying such total number of shares so offered by the exercise price of such rights or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Sale Price).
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date of announcement of such issuance.
 
To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
(d) (1) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and the Common Stock is not changed or exchanged), shares of its Capital Stock (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 4.3(a) applies), evidences of its Indebtedness or other non-cash assets, including securities, but excluding (x) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 4.3(c), (y) dividends or distributions of stock referred to in Section 4.3(a), and (z) dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash (such capital stock, evidence of its indebtedness, other non-cash assets or securities being distributed hereinafter in this Section 4.3(d) called the ""), then, in each such case, subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.3(d), the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:
distributed assets
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock; and
 
(ii) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock, less the Fair Market Value on such date of the portion of the distributed assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date) (determined as provided in Section 4.3(f)).
 
Such increase shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(2) If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 4.3(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any distributed assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "") used in computing the Current Market Price pursuant to Section 4.3(f) to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders.
Reference Period
 
(3) In the event any such distribution consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Company's Subsidiaries (a ""), the Fair Market Value of the securities to be distributed shall equal the average of the closing sale prices of such securities on the principal securities market on which such securities are traded for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the sixth Trading Day of those securities after the effectiveness of the Spin-Off, and the Current Market Price shall be measured for the same period. In the event, however, that an underwritten initial public offering of the securities in the Spin-Off occurs simultaneously with the Spin-Off, Fair Market Value of the securities distributed in the Spin-Off shall mean the initial public offering price of such securities, and the Current Market Price shall mean the Sale Price for the Common Stock on the same Trading Day.
Spin-Off
 
(4) Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""), (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (y) are not exercisable and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of Common Stock shall be deemed
Trigger Event
 
not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 4.3(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.3(d) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event. If such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different distributed assets, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a different number or amount of the foregoing or to purchase any of the foregoing at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance and record date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder thereof). Pursuant to rights issued under any Company shareholder rights plan, if holders of the Securities exercising the right of conversion after the date the rights separate from the underlying Common Stock are not entitled to receive the rights that would otherwise be attributable to the shares of Common Stock received upon conversion, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as though the rights were being distributed to holders of Common Stock on the date of such separation. If such an adjustment is made and the rights are later redeemed, invalidated or terminated, then a corresponding reversing adjustment will be made to the Conversion Rate on an equitable basis.
 
In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 4.3(d):
 
(i) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and
 
(ii) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued.
 
(5) For purposes of this Section 4.3(d) and Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 4.3(d) is applicable that also includes (x) shares of Common Stock, (y) a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section 4.3(b) applies or (z) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock to which Section 4.3(c) applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead to be:
 
(i) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision or combination or such rights or warrants or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock to which Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c) apply, respectively (and any Conversion Rate increase required by this Section 4.3(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by
 
(ii) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision or combination or such rights or warrants or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock (and any further Conversion Rate increase required by Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except:
 
1) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (x) "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution," "Record Date fixed for such determinations" and "Record Date" within the meaning of Section 4.3(a), (y) "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" and "the day upon which such combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 4.3(b), and (z) as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants," "the Record Date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and such "Record Date" within the meaning of Section 4.3(c); and
 
2) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 4.3(a) and any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision or combination shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution.
 
(e) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its shares of Common Stock, cash (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 4.4 applies, cash distributed as part of a distribution referred to in Section 4.3(d), or any cash that is distributed pursuant to a tender offer, to which Section 4.3(f) applies), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business of such Record Date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to such distribution by a fraction:
 
(i) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 4.3(h) on the Record Date); and
 
(ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to (a) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such date, less (b) an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the distribution per share of Common Stock and (ii) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock; that if such denominator shall be zero, the Conversion Rate shall be instead adjusted so that the Conversion Price is equal to one cent ($0.01).
provided, however
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Conversion Rate as adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.3(e) would cause the Conversion Price to be less than one cent ($0.01), then the Conversion Price shall be one cent ($0.01).
 
(f) In case the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Securities are outstanding, distribute cash or other consideration to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 4.4 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in Sections 4.3(d) or 4.3(e)), where the sum of the aggregate amount of such cash distributed and the aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), as of the Expiration Date, of such other consideration distributed (such sum, the "") expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer as of the Expiration Time (such tendered or exchanged shares of Common
Aggregate Amount
 
Stock, the "") exceeds the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date (such last date, the "") on which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (as the same may be amended through the Expiration Date), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business of such Expiration Date by a fraction:
Purchased Shares
Expiration Date
 
(1) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (I) the Aggregate Amount and (II) the product of (a) the Sale Price of Common Stock on the Expiration Date and (b) an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time (the "") at which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer less (ii) the Purchased Shares; and
Expiration Time
 
(2) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Expiration Time (including all Purchased Shares) and (II) the Sale Price of Common Stock on the Expiration Date.
 
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 4.3(f) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Company or a subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 4.3(f) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 4.3(f).
 
(g) In case any Person other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "") shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Securities are outstanding, distribute cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock, and where:
Offeror
 
(i) as of the closing date of such offer, the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of such offer;
 
(ii) according to the terms of such offer, following the completion of such offer the Offeror would hold at least 10% of the Common Stock outstanding as of the Expiration Date; and
 
(iii) the Aggregate Amount expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer as of the Expiration Time (such tendered or exchanged shares of Common Stock, the "") exceeds the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Expiration Dateon which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (as the same may be amended through the Expiration Date),
Purchased Shares
 
then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business of such Expiration Date by a fraction:
 
(1) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (I) the Aggregate Amount and (II) the product of (a) the Sale Price of Common Stock on the Expiration Date and (b) an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of last the Expiration Time at which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer less (ii) the Purchased Shares; and
 
(2) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Expiration Time (including all Purchased Shares) and (II) the Sale Price of Common Stock on the Expiration Date.
 
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 4.3(g) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Business Day following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Offeror is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but such Offeror is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 4.3(g) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 4.3(g).
 
(h) For purposes of this Article 4, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
 
"" on any date means the average of the daily Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the earlier of (A) such date and (B) the day immediately preceding the Ex Date with respect to the event requiring the computation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to this Section 4.3, such adjustments shall be made to the Current Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Section 4.3 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(j) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may, from time to time, increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time, if such period is at least 20 days, the Board of Directors determines that the increase in the Conversion Rate is in the best interest of the Company, and the increase is irrevocable during the period. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and each Holder at the address of such Holder as it appears in the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, a notice of the increase stating the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
 
(k) In any case in which this Section 4.3 shall require that any adjustment be made effective as of or retroactively immediately following a Record Date, the Company may elect to defer (but only for five Trading Days following the filing of the statement referred to in Section 4.5) issuing to the Holder of any Securities converted after such Record Date the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Rate prior to adjustment; that the Company shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

Any adjustments under this Section 4.3 shall be made successively whenever an event requiring such an adjustment occurs.
 
(m) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.3, the Holder of any Securities thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of stock of the Company other than shares of Common Stock into which the Securities originally were convertible, the Conversion Rate of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Security shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of this Section 4.3, and the provision of Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 through 4.9 with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares and the good faith determination of the Board of Directors as to any such adjustment shall be conclusive.

the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the TIA as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture, if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that the Holder's right to convert a Security into cash or Common Stock, if any, shall be changed to a right to convert a Security into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property (including cash) (collectively, "") receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, combination, merger, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to a fraction whose (i) denominator is one thousand (1,000) and whose (ii) numerator is the product of (A) the principal amount of such Security and (B) the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, combination merger, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance, assuming that such holder of Common Stock would not have exercised any rights of election that such holder of Common Stock would have had as a holder of Common Stock to select a particular kind or amount of consideration (provided, that if the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, combination, merger, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purposes of this Section 4.4, the kind and amount of consideration receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, combination, merger, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance for each Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-Electing Shares); , that after at the effective time of such reclassification, change, consolidation, combination, merger, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance, the Principal Return payable hereunder upon conversion of such Security shall continue to be payable in cash and the Net Share Settlement Conversion Value shall be calculated based on the fair value of the Exchange Property; in no event shall such Holder be entitled to more than the Net Share Settlement Conversion Value of a Security upon conversion of such Security. Such
Exchange Property

provided, further, that
 
supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 4.

The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Conversion Rate applicable to each Security that is surrendered for conversion, in accordance with this Article 4, at any time on or before the 30
th
day after the date of the mailing of the related Fundamental Change Company Notice under Section 3.9(a)(2) shall be increased to an amount equal to the Conversion Rate that would, but for this Section 4.5, otherwise apply to such Security pursuant to this Article 4, plus an amount equal to the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment; , that such increase to the Conversion Rate shall not apply if either:
provided, however
 
(i) such Make-Whole Fundamental Change constitutes a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change with respect to which the Company shall have duly made, and given full effect to, an election, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4.5(f), to make an Acquirer Stock Conversion Right Adjustment; or
 
(ii) such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is announced by the Company but shall not be consummated.
 
The additional consideration payable hereunder on account of any Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment with respect to a Security surrendered for conversion is herein referred to as the "."
Make-Whole Consideration

(b) As used herein, "" shall mean, with respect to each Make-Whole Fundamental Change and each applicable Security, an amount equal to a fraction whose numerator is the product of the Applicable Increase and the principal amount of such Security to be converted and whose denominator is one thousand dollars ($1,000). As used herein, "" shall mean, with respect to a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the amount, set forth in the following table, which corresponds to the effective date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change (the "") and the Applicable Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change:
Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment
Applicable Increase

, that:
provided, however
 
(i) if the actual Applicable Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two (2) prices listed in the table above under the column titled "Applicable Price," or if the actual Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two dates listed in the table above in the row immediately below the title "Effective Date," then the Applicable Increase for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by linear interpolation between the Applicable Increases set forth for such two prices, or for such two dates based on a three hundred and sixty five (365) day year, as applicable;
 
(ii) if the actual Applicable Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $240 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5(b)(iii)), or if the actual Applicable Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $77.06 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5(b)(iii)), then the Applicable Increase shall be equal to zero (0) and this Section 4.5 shall not require the Company to increase the Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
 
(iii) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to this Article 4 (other than solely pursuant to this Section 4.5), an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is
 
so required to be made, each price set forth in the table above under the column titled "Applicable Price" shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (A) such price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such price and (B) a fraction whose numerator is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Conversion Rate and whose denominator is the Conversion Rate to be in effect, in accordance with this Article 4, immediately after such adjustment to the Conversion Rate;
 
(iv) each Applicable Increase amount set forth in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3; and
 
(v) in no event shall the Conversion Rate applicable to any Security be increased pursuant to this Section 4.5 or pursuant to Sections 4.3(c), (d), (e), (f) or (j) above a maximum Conversion Rate of 12.9769 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Securities.
 
(c) As used herein, "" shall have the following meaning with respect to a Make-Whole Fundamental Change: (i) if the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights) for the Common Stock in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change consists solely of cash, then the "Applicable Price" with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be equal to the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change; and (ii) in all other circumstances, the "Applicable Price" with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be equal to the average of the Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, which average shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors, in its good faith determination (whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), to account for any adjustment, pursuant hereto, to the Conversion Rate that shall become effective, or any event requiring, pursuant hereto, an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex Date of such event occurs, at any time during such five (5) consecutive Trading Days.
Applicable Price
 
(d) The consideration in which the Make-Whole Consideration is payable shall be determined in accordance herewith.
 
(e) The Company shall provide notice of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change in a Fundamental Change Company Notice as required pursuant to Section 3.9(a)(2), and within 20 Business Days after the Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall publicly announce, through a reputable national newswire service, and publish on the Company's web site, such Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
 
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.5, if a Make-Whole Fundamental Change also constitutes a Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, then the Company shall have the right to, in lieu of increasing the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 4.5(a) in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, cause the right to convert the Securities in accordance with this Article 4 to change such that, from and after the effective time of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, the right of each Holder of any Security to convert such Security into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock shall be changed into the right to convert such Security solely into shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock applicable to such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change and cash for fractional shares thereof, at an initial Conversion Rate (which shall take effect at such effective time, but which shall thereafter be subject to adjustment in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to this Article 4) equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such effective
 
time multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the Reference Price and whose denominator is the average of the last reported sale prices per share of such Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days commencing on, and including, the Trading Day immediately after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Fundamental Change, which average shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors, in its good faith determination (which determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), to account for any event that, assuming such Public Acquirer Common Stock were Common Stock, would require, pursuant hereto, an adjustment to the Conversion Rate to become effective, or any such event whose Ex Date occurs, at any time during such five (5) consecutive Trading Days. Any such change in the right to convert the Securities in accordance with this Section 4.5(f) is herein referred to as an "."

Whenever an adjustment in the Conversion Rate with respect to the Securities is required:
 
(a) the Company shall forthwith place on file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent for such securities a certificate of the Treasurer of the Company, stating the adjusted Conversion Rate determined as provided herein and setting forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment; and

(a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Securities,
 
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all Securities then outstanding into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Securities would be held by a single Holder). The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and charges and, except as provided in Section 4.9, taxes with respect to the issue thereof.
 
(b) If any shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares or securities may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shares or securities to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. The Company further covenants that so long as the Common Stock shall be quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts, if permitted by the rules of NASDAQ, to have and keep approved for quoting on the NASDAQ National Market System (subject to notice of official issuance) all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the shares of Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of the Securities prior to such delivery upon any other national securities exchange upon which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or the portion, if any, of the Securities which are not so converted in a name other than that in which the Securities so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
 
The Company agrees, and each Holder is deemed to agree, that delivery to such Holder of the full number of shares of Common Stock into which each Security is convertible, together with any cash payment of such Holder's fractional shares, will be treated as a contingent payment (in an amount equal to the sum of the then Fair Market Value of such Common Stock and such cash payment, if any) on the Securities for purposes of the Contingent Payment Debt Regulations governing contingent payment debt obligations.
 
Nothing contained herein shall preclude any income tax withholding required by law or regulation upon conversion of the Securities, and at the Company's request, Holders shall be responsible for satisfying any such withholding.

By delivery to the Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock or other consideration issuable or payable upon conversion in accordance with this Article 4, any accrued and
 
unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest, if any, and Special Interest, if any), on such Securities will be deemed to have been paid in full. If any Securities are surrendered for conversion subsequent to the Record Date preceding an Interest Payment Date but prior to such Interest Payment Date, the Holder of such Securities at the close of business on such Record Date shall receive the interest payable on such Security on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof. Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Record Date preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date shall (except in the case of Securities which have been called for redemption on a Redemption Date within such period) be accompanied by payment from converting Holders, for the account of the Company, in New York Clearing House funds, or other funds of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date (excluding any overdue interest, if applicable) on the Securities being surrendered for conversion; , if the Company elects to redeem Securities on a date that is after the Regular Record Date but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, and such Holder elects to convert those Securities, the Holder will not be required to pay the Company, at the time that Holder surrenders those Securities for conversion, the amount of interest such Holder will have received on the Interest Payment Date.

The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with this Article 4.
