Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations
 
. On April 20, 2006 at a meeting of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") the Committee approved an amendment to the form of Incentive Stock Option Agreement and Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement used by the Company when making option grants pursuant to the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. The Committee also approved an amendment to the form of Restricted Stock Units Agreement used by the Company when making restricted stock unit grants pursuant to the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. The Form of Incentive Stock Option Agreement, Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement, and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are hereby incorporated by reference.
Amendment to Forms of Agreements under the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
. On April 20, 2006, at a meeting of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"), the Committee approved a nonstatory stock option to purchase a total of 10,000 shares of the common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), effective May 12, 2006, to John D. Thompson, Senior Vice-President, Corporate Development. The options granted shall fully vest upon Mr. Thompson's termination of employment from the Company, other than for Cause, and shall be fully exercisable until they expire on May 12, 2016. In addition, the certain options previously granted to Mr. Thompson on 11/13/2000, 2/28/2002, 10/15/2003, 5/14/2004, 11/12/2004, 5/13/2005, and 11/14/2005, were amended to (i) accelerate vesting upon Mr. Thompson's termination of employment from the Company; and (ii) be fully exercisable until they expire. These amendments are consistent with the new form of stock option agreements adopted by the Company on April 20, 2006, which allow extended exercisability to the optionee, if the optionee terminates employment after at least ten years of service and on or after the optionee's fifty-fifth birthday.

Tax Consequences
2.1 . This Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code, but the Company does not represent or warrant that this Option qualifies as such. The Optionee should consult with the Optionee's own tax advisor regarding the tax effects of this Option and the requirements necessary to obtain favorable income tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, including, but not limited to, holding period requirements (NOTE: If the Option is exercised more than three (3) months after the date on which you cease to be an Employee (other than by reason of your death or Disability), the Option will be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option and not as an Incentive Stock Option to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code).
Incentive Stock Option
2.2 To the extent that the Option (together with all Incentive Stock Options granted to the Optionee under all stock option plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) becomes exercisable for the first time during any calendar year for shares having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 2.2, options designated as Incentive Stock Options are taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock is determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a different limitation from that set forth in this Section 2.2, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If the Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 2.2, the Optionee may designate which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising. In the absence of such designation, the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first. Separate certificates representing each such portion shall be issued upon the exercise of the Option. (NOTE: If the aggregate Exercise Price of the Option (that is, the Exercise Price multiplied by the Number of Option Shares) plus the aggregate exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Options you hold (whether granted pursuant to the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Participating Company Group) is greater than $100,000, you should contact the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to ascertain whether the entire Option qualifies as an Incentive Stock Option.)
Incentive Stock Option Fair Market Value Limitation.

apparent authority with respect to such matter, right, obligation, or election. As a condition to receipt of the Option, all persons having an interest in the Option agree and understand that (i) if any error occurs with respect to the establishment, creation and/or administration of the Option, the Option shall be interpreted in light of the Board's original intent as determined in the sole discretion of the Board or the appropriate officer of the Company and (ii) the Board and/or appropriate officer of the Company shall have the authority to amend the Option, without the consent of the Optionee, to reflect the original intent of the Board with respect to the grant and terms of the Option.

Exercise of the Option
4.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, the Option shall be exercisable prior to the termination of the Option (as provided in Section 6) in an amount not to exceed the number of Vested Shares less the number of shares previously acquired upon exercise of the Option. In no event shall the Option be exercisable for more shares than the Number of Option Shares.
Right to Exercise.
4.2 Exercise of the Option shall be by written notice to the Company which must state the election to exercise the Option, the number of whole shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised and such other representations and agreements as to the Optionee's investment intent with respect to such shares as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Option Agreement. The written notice must be signed by the Optionee and must be delivered in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by confirmed facsimile transmission, or by such other means as the Company may permit, to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, or other authorized representative of the Participating Company Group, prior to the termination of the Option as set forth in Section 6, accompanied by full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased.

Method of Exercise.
4.3
Payment of Exercise Price.
(a) Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for the number of shares of Stock for which the Option is being exercised shall be made (i) in cash, by check, or cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company of whole shares of Stock owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Company without regard to any restrictions on transferability applicable to such stock by reason of federal or state securities laws or agreements with an underwriter for the Company) not less than the aggregate Exercise Price, (iii) by means of a Cashless Exercise, as defined in Section 4.3(c), or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.
Forms of Consideration Authorized.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company of shares of Stock to the extent such tender of Stock would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company's stock. The Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.
Tender of Stock.
(c) A "" means the assignment in a form acceptable to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the Option pursuant to a program, procedure or individual transaction approved by the Company (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to decline to approve or terminate any such program, procedure or individual transaction.
Cashless Exercise.
Cashless Exercise
4.4 At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Optionee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (i) the exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option, (ii) the transfer, in whole or in part, of any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option, (iii) the operation of any law or regulation providing for the imputation of interest, or (iv) the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option. The Optionee is cautioned that the Option is not exercisable unless the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group are satisfied. Accordingly, the Optionee may not be able to exercise the Option when desired even though the Option is vested, and the Company shall have no obligation to issue a certificate for such shares or release such shares from any escrow provided for herein.
Tax Withholding.
4.5 Except in the event the Exercise Price is paid by means of a Cashless Exercise, the certificate for the shares as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Optionee or, if applicable, in the names of the Optionee and his/her spouse, or in the names of the heirs of the Optionee.
Certificate Registration.
4.6 The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option
Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of Shares.

ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. Questions concerning this restriction should be directed to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

OF
THIS
SECTION
 
In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the ), may, without the consent of the Participant, either assume the Company's rights
"
Acquiror
"
 
and obligations under the Award or substitute for the Award a substantially equivalent award with respect to the Acquiror's stock. The Award shall become 100% vested and settled in accordance with Section 4 immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control to the extent that the Award is neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control.Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the Award immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 13.1(a)(i) of the Plan constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the Award shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.
 
Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares subject to the Award, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Participant's rights under the Award. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company." Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Such adjustments shall be determined by the Board, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares which may be issued in settlement of this Award until the date of the issuance of a certificate for such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 8 or pursuant to the Dividend Equivalent Rights. If the Participant is an Employee, the Participant understands and acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in a separate, written employment agreement between a Participating Company and the Participant, the Participant's employment is "at will" and is for no specified term. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Service of a Participating Company or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Participant's Service as a Director, an Employee or a Consultant, as the case may be, at any time.
 
The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of stock issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to this Award in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section.

12.3 The Board may terminate or amend the Plan or the Award at any time; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 7 in connection with a Change in Control, no such termination or amendment may adversely affect the Award without the consent of the Participant unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with any applicable law or government regulation. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing.
Termination or Amendment.
12.4 Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (except to the extent that this Agreement provides for effectiveness only upon actual receipt of such notice) upon personal delivery, upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, or with an overnight courier service with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address shown below that party's signature or at such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other party.

To the extent contemplated herein or therein, the provisions of the Notice and the Agreement shall survive any settlement of the Award and shall remain in full force and effect.
