The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of the Current Form 8-K, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and Item 7.01 of the Current Form 8-K, "Regulation FD Disclosure."
On February 12, 2009, Life Technologies Corporation, or the Company, issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for the period ended December 31, 2008. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1
Certain of the information set forth in the press release may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. We regularly have reported pro forma results for net income and earnings per share in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The pro forma results exclude merger related non-cash items and other similar costs.
Our financial results under GAAP include substantial non-cash charges and tax benefits related to acquired businesses. Our pro forma calculations of net income and earnings per share are limited because they do not reflect the entirety of our business costs. However, management believes that the pro forma presentation is a useful supplemental disclosure to investors as it provides an indication of the profitability and cash flows of the combined businesses apart from the initial, sunk cost of the acquisition. Management believes that this information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.
In addition to the non-cash charges above, we exclude from our non-GAAP results the following costs:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management views these costs as not indicative of the profitability or cash flows of its ongoing or future operations and excludes these costs as a supplemental disclosure to assist investors in evaluating and assessing our past and future operational performance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 Life Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: LIFE) today announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2008. Non-GAAP revenues for the fourth quarter were $545 million, including $4 million of non-GAAP revenue adjustments, resulting in full year non-GAAP revenues of $1,625 million, an increase of 27 percent over the $1,282 million reported for 2007. This includes $191 million of revenue from its recent acquisition of Applied Biosystems (AB), which closed on November 21, 2008. The closing date of the transaction resulted in approximately five weeks of revenue recognition.
CARLSBAD, CA, February 12, 2009
"We ended the year very strong, with our legacy Invitrogen business having more than 7 percent organic growth in the quarter," said Greg Lucier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Life Technologies. "I'm proud of what our team has accomplished, especially given the current economic environment and the significant energy we are putting into effectively integrating the Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen businesses. Our focus on controlling costs while still keeping our eye on the levers that drive growth have paid off, and we are in a very strong position as we enter 2009."
Fourth quarter diluted loss per share was $0.89 on a GAAP basis compared to earnings per share of $0.41 in the same period of the prior year. The year over year decrease was associated with the one-time costs related to the AB merger. The following analysis of diluted earnings per share identifies specific items that affect the comparability of results between periods. Reconciliations between Life Technologies' GAAP results and non-GAAP results for the periods reported are presented in the attached tables and on the company's Investor Relations page at www.lifetechnologies.com.

At today's currency exchange rates and the company's already implemented currency hedges, currency will have a negative impact on growth rates in 2009 of approximately four percentage points.
