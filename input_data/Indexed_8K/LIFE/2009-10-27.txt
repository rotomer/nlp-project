     On October 27, 2009, Life Technologies Corporation, or the Company, issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for the period ended September 30, 2009. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     Certain of the information set forth in the press release may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. We regularly have reported pro forma results for net income and earnings per share in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The pro forma results exclude merger related non-cash items and other similar costs.
     Our financial results under GAAP include substantial non-cash charges and tax benefits related to acquired businesses. Our pro forma calculations of net income and earnings per share are limited because they do not reflect the entirety of our business costs. However, management believes that the pro forma presentation is a useful supplemental disclosure to investors as it provides an indication of the profitability and cash flows of the combined businesses apart from the initial, sunk cost of the acquisition. Management believes that this information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.
     In addition to the non-cash charges above, we exclude from our non-GAAP results the following costs:
     Management views these costs as not indicative of the profitability or cash flows of its ongoing or future operations and excludes these costs as a supplemental disclosure to assist investors in evaluating and assessing our past and future operational performance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Life Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: LIFE) today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2009. Non-GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $805 million, an increase of 3 percent over third quarter revenue of $784 million in 2008, as if Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems had been combined. Excluding the impact of currency and the divested LIMS business unit, organic revenue grew 5 percent over the same period in the previous year.
CARLSBAD, CA, October 27, 2009
"I am very pleased that we've again delivered such strong results," said Greg Lucier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Life Technologies. "We saw good demand for our products and services around the globe, and began to receive the initial purchases emanating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The company also achieved its integration goals for the quarter, the most notable accomplishment being the completion of the portfolio review which resulted in the sale of our mass spectrometry joint venture to Danaher Corporation."
Third quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which includes $0.29 per share of acquisition related intangible amortization expense, $0.04 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of FSP APB14-1, and $0.15 per share of business integration costs and other items. In addition, GAAP earnings per share includes $0.03 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost resulting from the early payment of debt incurred as a result of the Applied Biosystems merger. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earning per share was $0.73.
