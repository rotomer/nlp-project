Item 8.01  Other Events
On January 28, 2010 at 8:30 a.m. EST, the company held a webcast to provide further details on fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results and full year 2010 financial expectations. A replay and transcript of the webcast will be available on the company's website until February 18, 2010. During this call, the company provided specific expectations for 2010 revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share. In addition to revenue growth and EPS estimates, the company also provided other estimates of financial performance, including Operating Margin expansion. The estimate for Operating Margin expansion was said to be 100  125 basis points. This estimate did not include the company's ongoing organic Operating Margin expansion expectations of 50 plus basis points. Therefore, the accurate estimate for total Operating Margin expansion is approximately 175 to 225 basis points.
The company also held a conference call on January 28, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. EST. The purpose of this call was to provide additional financial details and answers to questions posed after the 8:30 a.m. webcast. A replay and transcript of this conference call will be available on the company's website until February 18, 2010.
