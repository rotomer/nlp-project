ITEM 8.01 Restated Financial Statements to reflect a Change in Accounting Principle
Unless otherwise specific or the context otherwise indicates, all references to the words "The Company", "we" or "Life Technologies" refer to Life Technologies Corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. This Form 8-K amends the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
On January 1, 2009, we retroactively adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No. Accounting Principles Board (APB) 14-1, (FSP APB 14-1) (subsequently codified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in ASC 470-20 Topic of ) that significantly impacts the accounting for convertible debt. The FSP requires cash settled convertible debt, such as the Company's $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that are currently outstanding, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the bond, with the corresponding offset to additional paid in capital. FSP APB 14-1 is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Accordingly, the Company has amended and restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, including selected financial data for the periods presented. This will permit the Company to incorporate these financial statements in future Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. This Form 8-K is being filed to give effect to such amendments and restatements by amending and restating the following sections of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which amendments and restatements are included as exhibits to, and included in, this Current Report on Form 8-K:
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
The Company also has reclassified on the balance sheet the classification of the Mass Spectrometry joint venture to comply with the treatment under APB 18, , in the current period. As a result of this adjustment, which did not impact the statement of operations the Company has reclassified $357.4 million from goodwill and $88.1 million from intangible assets to long term investments. The related intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company does not believe this reclassification to be material to the financial statements. No other information in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 is being amended by this Form 8-K.
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock
No other modifications or updates to the disclosures contained herein have been made in this Current Report on Form 8-K for events that occurred after February 27, 2009, the date of filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, with the SEC. The information in this Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K, including any amendments to those filings.

Exhibit 99.2
ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW
     We are a global biotechnology tools company dedicated to helping our customers make scientific discoveries and ultimately improve the quality of life. Our systems, reagents, and services enable researchers to accelerate scientific exploration, driving to discoveries and developments that make life better. Life Technologies customers do their work across the biological spectrum, working to advance personalized medicine, regenerative science, molecular diagnostics, agricultural and environmental research, and 21st century forensics. In 2008, the Company had sales of approximately $1.6 billion, employed 9,700 people, had a presence in more than 100 countries, and possessed a rapidly growing intellectual property estate of approximately 3,600 patents and exclusive licenses.
     Our systems and reagents, enable, simplify and improve a broad spectrum of biological research of genes, proteins and cells within academic and life science research and commercial applications. Our scientific know-how is making biodiscovery research techniques more effective and efficient to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, government and academic researchers with backgrounds in a wide range of scientific disciplines.
     We offer many different products and services, and are continually developing and/or acquiring others. Some of our specific product categories include the following:
     During the 2008 fiscal year, we divided our products and services into the following three broad segments, which are further described below: BioDiscovery, Cell Systems and Applied Biosystems. The BD and CS markets are closely aligned with the target markets of our business prior to our acquisition of Applied Biosystems. The AB segment represents the products and services of the acquired AB business. Upon completion of the acquisition, we commenced the process of integrating the businesses and administration of the two organizations.
 
     Our BD segment includes molecular biology, cell biology and drug discovery product lines. Molecular biology encompasses products from the initial cloning and manipulation of DNA, to examining RNA levels and regulating gene expression in cells, to capturing, separating and analyzing proteins. These include the research tools used in reagent and kit form that simplify and improve gene acquisition, gene cloning, gene expression and gene analysis techniques. This segment also includes a full range of enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents. These biologics are manufactured to the highest research standards and are matched in a gene specific, validated manner (gene, ORF, RNAi, protein, antibodies, etc.) to ensure researchers the highest purity and scientific relevance for their experimentation. We also offer software through this segment that enables more efficient, accelerated analysis and interpretation of genomic, proteomic and other biomolecular data for application in pharmaceutical, therapeutic and diagnostic development. The acquisitions of Zymed, Caltag, Dynal and Biosource have enhanced our ability to offer new technology and products, such as antibodies and proteins (Zymed, Caltag and BioSource) and magnetic beads used for biological separation (Dynal), which is the first step in almost every biologic investigative or diagnostic process.
BioDiscovery (BD).
     Researchers studying cells, and manufacturers that use cells to make biopharmaceuticals and other products, need to grow cells in the laboratory (referred to as ) under conditions that simulate the environment in which cells live naturally (referred to as ), and they need to provide those cells with the nutrients required for them to remain alive. Our CS segment includes all of our GIBCO cell culture products and services, which are used for these purposes. Products include sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce biopharmaceuticals and other end products made through cultured cells. CS services include the creation of commercially viable stable cell lines and the optimization of production processes used for the production of therapeutic drugs.
Cell Systems (CS).
in vitro
in vivo
     The AB products and services include a broad portfolio of instrument-based systems, consumables, software, and services for academic research, the life science industry, and commercial markets. These products and services incorporate proprietary technology used for DNA, RNA, protein, and small molecule analysis. Our AB products include complete instrument-reagent systems, such as PCR and Real-Time PCR systems, capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems and next-generation DNA sequencing systems. Additional products include mass spectrometry systems which are used to identify and quantify a wide range of analytes, including proteins and chemical compounds, Ambion RNA reagents, as well as, specialized applied markets products and services.
Applied Biosystems (AB).
     The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. We divide our principal market and customer base into principally three categories:
     The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions such as the United States National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, energy, agricultural, and chemical companies. Researchers at these institutions are using our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities, such as: searching for drugs or other techniques to combat a wide variety of diseases, such as cancer and viral and bacterial disease; researching diagnostics for disease identification [or prognosis] or for improving the efficacy of drugs to targeted patient groups; and assisting in vaccine design, bioproduction, and agriculture. Our products and services provide the research tools needed for genomics studies, proteomics studies, gene splicing, cellular analysis, and other key research applications that are required by these life science researchers. In addition, our research tools are important in the development of diagnostics for disease determination as well as identification of patients for more targeted therapy.
Life science researchers.
     We serve industries that apply genetic engineering to the commercial production of useful but otherwise rare or difficult to obtain substances, such as proteins, interferons, interleukins, t-PA and monoclonal antibodies. The manufacturers of these materials require larger quantities of the same sera and other cell growth media that we provide in smaller quantities to researchers. Industries involved in the commercial production of genetically engineered products include the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food processing and agricultural industries.
Commercial producers of biopharmaceutical and other high valued proteins.
     We provide tools that apply our technology to enable or improve activities in particular markets, which we refer to as applied markets. The current focus of our products for these markets is in the areas of: forensic analysis, which is used to identify individuals based on their DNA; quality and safety testing, such as testing required to measure food, beverage, or environmental quality, and pharmaceutical manufacturing quality and safety; and biosecurity, which refers to products needed in response to the threat of biological terrorism and other malicious, accidental, and natural biological dangers. The Applied Biosystems branded forensic testing and human identification products and services are innovative and market-leading tools that have been widely accepted by investigators and laboratories in connection with, for example, criminal investigations, the exoneration of individuals wrongly accused or convicted of crimes, identifying victims of disasters, and paternity testing.
Users who apply our technologies to enable or improve particular activities.
 
Our Strategy
     Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery diagnostics and commercial applications.
     Our strategies to achieve this objective include:
 
     We will focus our investments and resources in markets that provide high growth opportunities, particularly in four areas:
     We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under "Risk Factors Related to Our Operations."
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
Revenues
     Revenues increased $342.9 million or 27% for 2008 compared to 2007 before the unallocated adjustment of purchased deferred revenue. Of the $342.9 million increase in revenue, revenue from AB accounted for 56% of total increase or $191.0 million. The remaining $151.9 million was primarily a result of $71.8 million of increased volume and new product revenue, $40.3 million in favorable foreign currency translation, $30.1 million in increased price and product mix optimization, $6.7 million of freight recovery and $2.8 million of royalty revenue. The Company continues to drive revenue through new product offerings and market expansion combined with price and product mix optimization.
     Changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines.
 
     BD revenues increased $87.7 million or 10% for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily driven by $27.4 million in increased volume and new product revenue, favorable impacts of $27.1 million in foreign currency translation, $25.7 million in increased price and product mix optimization, and $3.1 million increase in royalty revenue.
BioDiscovery (BD).
     CS revenues increased $64.2 million or 17% for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily a result of increased volume and new product revenue of $44.4 million, favorable impacts of $13.3 million from foreign currency translation, and increased price and product mix optimization of $4.4 million.
Cell Systems (CS).
     Sales of cell culture products for large-scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly.
     AB revenues were $191.0 million for the period ending December 31, 2008. As the Company acquired AB as of November 21, 2008, as a result only five weeks of operations are included in the statement of operations and comparable results to the prior year are not applicable. Revenues from AB for the year ended 2008 adjusted for currency impacts were in line with management expectations. Consumables and instruments sales consisted of 47% and 39% or $90.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively, of total segment revenues.
Applied Biosystems (AB).
Gross Profit
     Gross profit increased $224.9 million or 31% for 2008 compared to 2007. Of the $224.9 million increase in gross profit, gross profit from AB accounts for 56% of the total increase or $126.7 million. The remaining $98.2 million increase was primarily a result of $33.6 million in increased volume and new products, increased price of $30.1 million, and $28.2 million in favorable foreign currency impacts. Drivers of year over year changes in the gross margin are consistent with the drivers of revenue year over year. Gross profit for 2008 included an increase of $4.3 million and $30.8 million of deferred revenue adjustments and acquired inventory fair market value adjustments as a result of a business combination. These adjustments impact the results of Applied Biosystems margins. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, the acquired deferred revenue and inventory is adjusted to fair value. The Company amortizes this fair value adjustment into income in line with the underlying acquired assets and liabilities.
     Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets was $86.9 million for 2008 compared to $98.7 million for 2007. The decrease in intangible amortization is due to the completion of amortization of certain acquired intangibles at the end of 2007, partially offset by the amortization of the new intangibles acquired in the Applied Biosystem acquisition.
     We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments received or paid on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements and foreign currency rates.
     BD gross margin increased 1% to 71% for 2008 compared to 70% in 2007 primarily due to lower operating costs, improved pricing and increased sales volume with favorable foreign currency translation.
BioDiscovery (BD).
     CS gross margin increased 4% to 54% for 2008 compared to 50% in 2007. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of improved productivity and increased sales volume with favorable foreign currency translation.
Cell Systems (CS).
     AB gross margin was 66% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher gross margins were primarily the result of lower operating costs as the Company focused on spending during the period, which was offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $12.1 million. As the Company acquired AB as of November 21, 2008, as a result only five weeks of operations are included in the income statement and comparable results to the prior year are not applicable.
Applied Biosystems (AB).
 
Operating Expenses
     In 2008, sales and marketing expenses increased $59.0 million or 23% compared to 2007. Of the $59.0 million increase, $28.1 million resulted from the acquisition of AB. The remaining $30.9 million increase resulted primarily in increased salaries and bonuses of $16.3 million, travel expense of $3.2 million, increased infrastructure expense of $3.9 million, unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $3.5 million and $2.2 million from share-based compensation.
Sales and Marketing.
     In 2008, general and administrative expenses increased $24.3 million or 15% compared to 2007. Of the $24.3 million increase, $17.0 million resulted from the acquisition of AB. The remaining $7.3 million increase resulted from increased salary and bonus expenses of $12.6 million, purchased services of $3.5 million and depreciation expense of $2.6 million, partially offset by $11.7 million in decreased infrastructure expenses. We continue to pursue programs and initiatives to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will continue and further result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.
General and Administrative.
     Research and development expenses for 2008 increased $26.7 million or 23% compared to 2007. Of the $26.7 million increase, $17.5 million resulted from acquisition of AB. The remaining $9.2 million increase resulted primarily from an increase of $7.2 million in salaries and bonus expenses and $3.2 million in increased supplies expense partially offset by $0.9 million of purchased services. Overall, gross research and development expenses increased 23 percent year over year as a result of our continued efforts to expand new product development projects. We expect research and development expenses to be in the range of 9-10% as a percentage of sales as we continue efforts to drive growth through new product development.
Research and Development.
     As a result of the Company's acquisitions in 2008, primarily Applied Biosystems, the Company has incurred an expense of $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This amount estimates the fair value, under the royalty relief method, of various acquired in-process research projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have future alternative use as of the date of the merger.
Purchased In Process Research and Development.
     Business consolidation costs for 2008 were $38.6 million, compared to $5.6 million in 2007, and represent costs associated with our acquisition efforts related to AB and to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. Included in these costs are various activities related to the acquisition which were associated with combining the two companies and consolidating redundancies. Also included in these expenses are one time expenses associated with third party providers assisting in the realignment of the two companies. We expect to continue to incur business consolidation costs in 2009 as we further consolidate operations and facilities of the newly acquired AB and to realign the previously existing businesses.
Business Consolidation Costs.
 
Other Income (Expense)
     Interest income was $24.6 million in 2008 compared to $28.0 million in 2007. The $3.4 million decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average yield of our investments in 2008 along with the lower balance in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the purchase price paid for the AB acquisition.
Interest Income.
     Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short-term interest rates and changes in cash balances, which may materially increase or decrease as a result of acquisitions, debt repayment, stock repurchase programs and other financing activities.
     Interest expense was $85.1 million for 2008 compared to $67.4 million for 2007. The primary reason for the $17.7 million increase in interest expense was interest incurred on the $2,400.0 million new debt issued in November 2008 in conjunction with acquisition of Applied Biosystems.
Interest Expense.
     Other income, net, was $5.7 million for 2008 compared to $0.3 million for 2007. The primary reason for the $5.4 million increase in other income was foreign currency net gains of $4.0 million and joint venture income of $1.6 million related to our interest in the joint venture.
Other Income (Expense), Net.
     The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre-tax income was 96.1% for 2008 compared with 23.7% of our pre-tax income for 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to US income tax recognized in connection with the repatriation of non-US retained earnings to help fund the AB acquisition and to purchased in-process research and development costs at acquired companies which were expensed for financial reporting purposes but were not deductible for tax purposes.
Provision for Income Taxes.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
Revenues
     Revenues increased $130.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of $59.7 million of increased volume and new product revenue, $40.6 million in foreign currency translation, and $29.8 million of price increases.
     BioDiscovery revenues increased $87.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily driven by $29.4 million in increased volume and new product revenue, $28.6 million in increased prices and a favorable impact of $28.9 million in foreign currency translation.
BioDiscovery (BD).
     CS revenues increased $43.0 million or 13% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of increased volume and new product revenue of $30.3 million along with favorable impact of $11.7 million in foreign currency translation.
Cell Systems (CS).
Gross Profit
     Gross profit increased $107.6 million or 18% for 2007 compared to 2006. Gross profit for 2007 and 2006 included approximately $0.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of costs associated with the write-up of acquired inventory to fair market value as a result of a business combination. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, this acquired inventory was written-up to fair market value and subsequently expensed as the inventory was sold. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $98.7 million for 2007 compared to $110.7 million for 2006. The $12.0 million decrease was mainly due to intangible assets acquired in prior periods being fully amortized during the year. The primary drivers for the increase in gross margin is related to $47.5 million in pricing and volume increases, $22.1 million in productivity increases and $26.4 million in favorable foreign currency translation.
 
     BioDiscovery gross margin increased 2% to 70% for 2007 compared to 68% in 2006 primarily due to lower operating costs, improved pricing and increased sales volume.
BioDiscovery (BD).
     CS gross margin decreased 2% to 50% for 2007 compared to 52% in 2006. Declines in gross margin were primarily the result of higher operating expenses and declines in sera pricing.
Cell Systems (CS).
Operating Expenses
     For 2007, sales and marketing expenses increased $19.6 million or 8% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increased salaries and bonuses of $13.2 million, $4.5 million of additional purchased services expenses and $6.0 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses of $3.9 million as well as a decrease in supplies expenses of $1.4 million.
Sales and Marketing.
     For 2007, general and administrative expenses increased $14.0 million or 9% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increases salaries and bonuses of $23.1 million, additional depreciation expense of $4.7 million which was driven by increased capital expenditures, $1.6 million in increases of travel expenses and $2.1 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease of $7.0 in stock based compensation expense, $5.8 million in purchased services expenses, $1.4 million in bad debt expenses and $4.3 million in other expenses.
General and Administrative.
     Research and development expenses for 2007 increased $11.5 million or 11% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from $5.4 million of salaries and bonus expenses, $1.4 million in increased purchase services expenses, $1.4 million in other expenses and $1.5 million in foreign currency translation expenses. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in supplies expense. Overall, gross research and development expenses increased 11 percent year over year as a result of our continued efforts to drive growth through new product development projects. We expect research and development expenses to remain at this level as a percentage of sales as we continue efforts to drive growth through new product development.
Research and Development.
     Business consolidation costs for 2007 were $5.6 million, compared to $12.5 million in 2006, and represent costs associated with our efforts to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. These costs consisted mainly of termination benefits of certain employees involuntarily terminated. We expect to continue to incur business consolidation costs in 2008 as we further consolidate operations and facilities.
Business Consolidation Costs.
 
Other Income (Expense)
     Interest income was $28.0 million in 2007 compared to $26.7 million in 2006. The $1.3 million increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average yield of our investments in 2007, partially offset by the effect of lower investment balances due to the payoff of the 2006 2 /% Convertible Notes and the share repurchase program.
Interest Income.
1
4
     Interest expense was $67.4 million for 2007 compared to $69.2 million for 2006. The primary reason for the $1.8 million reduction in interest expense was the maturity of the 2006 2 1/4% Convertible Notes in the prior year which were not part of the 2007 expense.
Interest Expense.
     Other income (expense), net, for 2007 and 2006 was comparable at $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
Other Income (Expense), Net.
     The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre-tax income was 23.7% for 2007 compared with 20.6% of our pre-tax income for 2006. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in income earned in jurisdictions having lower tax rates.
Provision for Income Taxes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     Operating activities provided net cash of $365.8 million during 2008 primarily from our net income of $5.7 million plus net non-cash charges of $381.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net decrease of $20.9 million in cash during the period. Within the non-cash charges in operating activities, the primary drivers were amortization of intangible assets of $86.9 million, share based compensation of $47.0 million, depreciation charges of $45.7 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of $40.2 million and acquired inventory fair market value adjustments of $34.0 million. The primary drivers of cash proceeds from changes in operating assets and liabilities were increases in accrued expenses of $109.2 million and decreases in inventories of $11.1 million which were offset by increases in trade account receivable of $112.3 million, decreases in accounts payable of $22.2 million, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $9.9 million for a net decrease of $20.9 million. The overall decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities is due to the acquisition of Applied Biosystems and the operational nature of the business. Sales peak in the final month of the quarter, which drives up accounts receivable and reduces the amount of inventory on hand. In conjunction with a reduction of inventory, a corresponding decrease in accounts payable generally occurs. As we acquired Applied Biosystems on November 21, 2008, only the final portion of the quarter is reflected in the cash flow from operations.
Operating Activities.
     As a result of working capital improvement programs, we expect to utilize our working capital more effectively in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal and, on an interim basis during the year, may require an influx of short-term working capital.
     Net cash used by investing activities during 2008 was $2,889.7 million. The cash was used for business combinations of $2,859.0 million and purchases of property plant and equipment of $81.9 million partially offset by securities available for sale of $54.7 million.
Investing Activities.
     For 2009, we expect to spend more on purchases of property, plant and equipment compared to 2008, in the range of $175-200 million which includes approximately $50 million of integration related capital expenditures. The spending will be driven in part by additional capital equipment, information technology, and integration related capital as a result of merger with Applied Biosystems.
     In 2008, we completed the acquisitions of Applied Biosystems and CellzDirect for total purchase prices of $4,587.5 million and $57.3 million, respectively, of which $2,765.2 million and $57.3 million, respectively, were paid in cash. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition. Additionally, the Company completed two other acquisitions, immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements for $30.3 million in cash consideration. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
     In 2007, we completed two acquisitions immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2007 was $31.2 million, of which $23.1 million related to acquisitions completed in 2007. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
     In late 2006, we completed an acquisition immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2006 was $44.0 million, of which $15.1 million was related to the acquisition completed in 2006. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results.
     Pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain prior year and current year acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on the achievement of future gross sales of the acquired companies through 2010. The agreements do not limit the payment to a maximum amount. During the years ended 2008, none of contingent payments were earned or paid for the achievement of future gross sales. The Company will account for such contingent payments as an addition to the purchase price of the acquired company in accordance with SFAS 141, .
Accounting for Business Combinations
     There were no contingent cash payments based upon certain research and development milestones or operating results of the acquired companies as of December 31, 2008. During the year ended 2008, none of contingent payments were earned or paid for the achievement of operating results. During the year ended 2007, $2.0 million of contingent payments were earned and paid for the achievement of operating results and $51.5 million of contingent payments for operating results have expired.
     Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,301.4 million for 2008. The primary drivers were $2,435.6 million from issuance of long term obligations and $47.8 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. These cash inflows were offset by fees paid on the issued term loan A and term loan B credit facilities of $92.3 million and by repurchases of our common stock of $105.2 million.
Financing Activities.
Term Loan
     On November 21, 2008, the Company entered into $2,650 million of credit facilities consisting of: (1) a revolving credit facility of $250 million; (2) a term loan A facility of $1,400 million; and (3) a term loan B facility of $1,000 million. The Company's credit facilities are governed by a credit agreement among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents, DnB Nor Bank, ASA and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Co-Documentation Agents, and other lender parties thereto. The proceeds of the term loan facilities, together with other sources, were used to finance (1) the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to stockholders of Applied Biosystems, (2) costs and expenses related to the merger transactions, (3) the repayment of, and termination of all commitments to make extensions of credit under certain of the Company's and Applied Biosystems' existing indebtedness, which did not include the Company's existing convertible notes and certain other indebtedness, and (4) the Company's ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes after the merger. At the effective time of the merger, the Company borrowed the entire amount available under the term loan facilities. The debt facilities terminated in connection with the entry into the Company's new credit facilities included the Company's $250.0 million syndicated secured revolving credit facility entered into on January 9, 2006 with Bank of America N.A. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has issued $12.9 million in letters of credit through the new revolving credit facility, and, accordingly, the remaining credit available under that facility is $237.1 million.
     The credit agreement provides that loans under the the credit facilities bear interest based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or, if the Company so elects, on Bank of America's prime lending rate (the "Base Rate"). For the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, interest is computed based on the Company's leverage ratio as shown below:
     The Company, at its' discretion, can elect borrowings based either on Eurocurrency Rates or Base Rates. From the closing date, November 21, 2008 to the date on which the Administrative Agent receives a compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending of 2009, the pricing will be Pricing Level 1. Term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00% subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3.00% for the first three years after the closing date, or, if the Company so elects, at Base Rate plus 2.00%. In association with the term loan agreement, the Company is required to swap three years of $800.0 million in variable rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments within 90 days of the signing of the agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2008 and within the 90 day window, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to comply with this requirement.
 
     The Company must repay 1.25% of the principal amount of the term loan A in each quarter of 2009, 2.5% in each quarter of 2010 and 2011, 3.75% in each quarter of 2012 and 15% in each quarter of 2013, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding under the term loan A facility, plus accrued interest, due on November 21, 2013. The Company must repay in each quarter, beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2008, 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loan B with the final payment of all amounts outstanding under the term loan B facility, plus accrued interest, due on November 21, 2015. The Company can prepay the term loans without penalty. The revolving credit facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder, plus accrued interest, will be due on November 21, 2013. During the year ended 2008, the Company repaid principal of zero and $2.5 million for term loan A and term loan B, respectively. Costs incurred to issue the debt under the credit facility totaled $43.5 million for term loan A, $41.0 million for term loan B, and $7.8 million for the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company amortized debt issuance costs of $0.8 million, $0.8 million, and $0.2 million for term loan A, term loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the unamortized balances of the issuance costs were $42.6 million, $40.3 million, and $7.6 million for term loan A, term loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively.
     The Company's credit agreement requires the loans to be prepaid with a portion of the net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course sales or other dispositions of property and assets and casualty proceeds, condemnation awards and certain other extraordinary receipts, subject to exceptions. The portion of such net cash proceeds to be applied to prepayments of loans will be determined based on our leverage ratio, with 100% to be applied if the leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00x; 50% if the leverage ratio is less than 3.00x and greater than or equal to 2.50x; and 0% if the leverage ratio is less than 2.50x. Loans under the Company's credit facilities will also be required to be prepaid with 100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of new debt (other than certain debt permitted by the credit agreement). These mandatory prepayments will be applied to the repayment of the term facilities as the Company directs.
     The credit agreement allows the Company to make certain investments and share repurchases, subject to restrictions based on leverage. If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00x, the Company may spend up to $500.0 million annually on acquisitions and share repurchases in any fiscal year. If the Company's leverage ratio less than 3.00x, there is no limit to investments in acquisitions or share repurchases.
     The credit agreement governing the Company's new credit facilities contains financial maintenance covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. These financial maintenance covenants apply beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. Initially, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25x. This maximum leverage ratio reduces on a quarterly schedule to 3.75x by December 31, 2009 and to 3x by December 31, 2010. After December 31, 2010, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00x. The Company will be also be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.75x. The credit agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company's and its subsidiaries, subject to materiality and other qualifications and exceptions.
     Obligations under the Company's credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default as defined in the credit agreement, including failure to pay any principal when due and payable, failure to pay interest within three business days after due, failure to comply with any covenant, representation or condition of any loan document or swap contract, any change of control, cross-defaults, and certain other events as set forth in the credit agreement, with grace periods in some cases.
     The Company's obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by each of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and are collateralized by substantially all of the Company's and its guarantor subsidiaries' assets.
Secured Loan
     At December 31, 2008 the Company holds $35.6 million in AAA rated auction rate securities with UBS Investment Bank. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for the Company's holdings because sell orders exceeded buy orders. As a result of the failed auctions, the Company is holding illiquid securities because the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. In August, 2008, UBS announced that it has agreed to a settlement in principle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other state regulatory agencies represented by North American Securities Administrators Association to restore liquidity to all remaining clients who hold auction rate securities. UBS committed to repurchase auction rate securities from their private clients at par beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is intended to have this settlement between June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2012. Until UBS fully redeems the Company's auction rate securities, UBS has loaned to the Company at par without recourse with accrued interest charged at the same rate as the yields earned on the underlying securities. The UBS loan is collateralized by the auction rate securities. For information on auction rate securities, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
 
Convertible Debt
     On June 20, 2005, the Company sold 3 /% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 3 /% Notes) to certain qualified institutional investors at par value. Including the exercise of the over-allotment option, the total size of the offering was $350.0 million. After expenses, net proceeds to the Company were $343.0 million.

     Interest is payable on the 3 /% Notes semi-annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the 3 /% Notes may be required to be paid per six-month period beginning June 15, 2011, if the market value of the 3 /% Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the 3 /% Notes' principal value. The 3 /% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the 3 /% Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 3 /% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Prepayment of amounts due under the 3 /% Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the 3 /% Notes' principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, the Company's default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in the 3 /% Notes or indenture, or upon cross-default by the Company or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of other debt of the Company or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50.0 million.

     The terms of the 3 /% Notes require the Company to settle the par value of the 3 /% Notes in cash and deliver shares only for the excess, if any, of the conversion value (based on a conversion price of $49.13) over the par value.

     In February 2004 and August 2003, the Company issued $450.0 million principal amount of 1 /% Convertible Senior Notes (the Old 1 /% Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $350.0 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (the Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023 to certain qualified institutional buyers, respectively. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds of $440.1 million and $340.7 million for the Old 1 /% Notes and Old 2% Notes, respectively. Interest on the Old Notes was payable semi-annually on February 15 and 1 and August 15 and 1, for the Old 1 /% Notes and the Old 2% Notes, respectively. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 /% and 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old Notes may have been required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012 and August 1, 2010, if the market value of the Old Notes during specified testing periods was 120% or more of the principle value, for the Old 1 /% Notes and the Old 2% Notes, respectively. This contingent interest feature was an embedded derivative with a de minimis value, to which no value had been assigned at issuance of either of the Old Notes or as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Old Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and were convertible shares of common stock at the option of the holder, subject to certain conditions described below, at a price of $51.02 and $34.12 per share for the Old 1 /% Notes and Old 2% Notes, respectively. The Old Notes were to be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after February 15, 2012 (for the Old 1 /% Notes) and August 1, 2010 (for the Old 2% Notes) at 100% of the principal amount. In addition, the holders of the Old Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Old Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on three separate dates per their issuance agreement.

     The Old Notes also contained restricted convertibility features that did not affect the conversion price of the notes but, instead, placed restrictions on the holder's ability to convert their notes into shares of the Company's common stock (conversion shares). Holders were able to convert their Old Notes into shares of the Company's common stock prior to stated maturity.
     During December 2004, the Company offered up to $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non-cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 98% or $342.4 million of the Old 2% Notes has been exchanged by their holders for New 2% Notes as of December 31, 2008.
     During December 2004, the Company offered up to $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1 /% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 /% Notes) in a non-cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 /% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 99% or $446.1 million of the Old 1 /% Notes has been exchanged by their holders for New 1 /% Notes as of December 31, 2008.

     The New 2% Notes and New 1 /% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 /% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following: the terms of the New Notes require the Company to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the excess, if any, of the notes' conversion value (based on conversion

prices of $34.12 and $51.02 for the New 2% Notes and New 1 /% Notes, respectively) over their par values. As such, EITF 90-19 and 04-8 required the Company to use the treasury stock equivalent method to calculate diluted earnings per share, as if the New Notes were outstanding since date of issuance, the date the Old Notes were issued.

     Costs incurred to issue the convertible notes totaled $7.6 million for the 3 /% Notes, $9.3 million for the Old 1 /% Notes, and $9.3 million for the Old 2% Notes. Finance costs (excluding legal and accounting fees) incurred to conduct the exchange of the Old Notes totaled $1.8 million ($0.8 million related to the Old 2% Notes and $1.0 million related to the Old 1 /% Notes). These costs have been deferred and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the terms of the respective debt using the effective interest method. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the unamortized balances of the issuance costs were $7.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively.

     In the event of a change of control of the Company, the holders of the 3 /% Notes, Old Notes and New Notes each have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest.

     Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP APB 14-1, which requires retrospective application. The FSP requires cash settled convertible debt, such as the Company's $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that are currently outstanding, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the bond, with the corresponding offset to additional paid in capital. As a result of the adoption, the effective interest rate applicable to the Company's convertible senior notes was 7.21%, 6.10% and 5.95% for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 notes, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company carries debt discounts of $27.2 million, $58.1 million and $21.9 million, for the 2023, 2024, and 2025 Notes, respectively, which will be amortized into income using the effective interest method through July 2010 for the 2023 Notes, January 2012 for the 2024 Notes and June 2011 for the 2025 Notes. For additional information on the impact of this change on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
     In July 2007, the Board approved a program authorizing management to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock over the next three years. Under the 2007 plan, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total cost of approximately $135.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 1.2 million shares at a total cost of approximately $100.0 during the year ended December 31, 2008. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders' equity.
     We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery, Cell Systems, and Applied Biosystems' platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and/or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. Our credit facilities contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock, make acquisitions and incur debt.
     As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $335.9 million and long-term investments of $490.9 million. Our working capital was $604.9 million as of December 31, 2008 and includes restricted cash of $112.4 million. Our funds are currently invested in marketable securities, money market funds, corporate notes, government securities, highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits, and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than three months. A majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and long term investments are held in the United States. Repatriation of funds outside of the United States are subject to local laws and customs. As of December 31, 2008, foreign subsidiaries in China, Japan, Norway, and India had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short-term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $13.4 million, of which $0.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008.
     We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, long-term investments, and funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the first quarter of 2010. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. In 2008, the Company generated $365.8 million from operating activities and continues to expect to be able to in the future. We believe a combination of the Company's cash generating abilities from operations, future economic outlook and current financing structure will allow the Company to continue operation without interruption during the current economic environment. Additionally, the Company believes under its term loan agreement it would be able to obtain additional borrowing should the need arise. However, the company believes this need is unlikely.
 
Restructuring
     The Company has undertaken restructuring activities in connection with the Applied Biosystems acquisition. These activities, which have been accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 146, have primarily included one-time personnel benefit costs, specifically severance costs related to duplicative positions and change in control agreements, to mostly manufacturing, finance and research and development employees of Applied Biosystems and Life Technologies. The restructuring plan does also include charges associated with closure of certain leased facilities and other one-time personnel benefit costs, specifically relocation costs. The Company currently continues to finalize its restructuring plan, and expects to complete the plan within a year. The plan will likely cause material effect on the Company's statements of operation and cash flows. As a result of the plan, the Company expects to achieve operating efficiencies in future periods related to salary and overhead costs specifically related to its general and administrative and research and development costs. As of December 31, 2008, the company had recorded liabilities of approximately $69.1 million related to this plan.

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
     The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title of the product or performance of services. Transfer of title generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. Concurrently, we record provisions for warranty, returns, and installation based on historical experience and anticipated product performance. Revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment of products in situations where risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer at a point other than shipment due to the shipping terms, the existence of an acceptance clause, the achievement of milestones, or some return or cancellation privileges. Revenue is recognized once customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse. Service revenue is recognized over the period services are performed. If our shipping policies or acceptance clause were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up-front payments as deferred revenue in current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $118.2 million at December 31, 2008.
Revenue Recognition.
     We also enter into arrangements whereby revenues are derived from multiple deliverables. In these revenue arrangements, we record revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, and Emerging Issues Task Force
Revenue Recognition
 
("EITF") Consensus Issue 00-21, and related pronouncements. Specifically, we record revenue as the separate elements are delivered to the customer if the delivered item is determined to represent a separate earnings process, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially in our control. For instruments where installation is determined to be a separate earnings process, the portion of the sales price allocable to the fair value of the installation is deferred and recognized when installation is complete. We determine the fair value of the installation process based on technician labor billing rates, the expected number of hours to install the instrument based on historical experience, and amounts charged by third parties. We continually monitor the level of effort required for the installation of our instruments to ensure that appropriate fair values have been determined. Revenues from multiple-element arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received and/or billable in connection with other rights and services that represent our continuing obligations, are deferred until all of the multiple elements have been delivered or until objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements has been established. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple-element arrangements based on the prices charged when the similar elements are sold separately to third parties. If objective and verifiable evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but objective and verifiable evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the revenues from delivered elements are not recognized until the fair value of the undelivered element or elements has been determined. Contract interpretation is normally required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements, when to begin to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized.
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
     We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable during the applicable period based on historical activity, and make revisions for actual royalties received in the following quarter. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated royalty revenue were significantly different from actual royalties received, however, historically, these revisions have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. For those arrangements where royalties cannot be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue on the receipt of cash or royalty statements from our licensees. Since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and/or remitted their cash payment to us. In addition, we recognize up-front nonrefundable license fees when due under contractual agreement, unless we have specific continuing performance obligations requiring deferral of all or a portion of these fees. If it cannot be concluded that a licensee fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of an arrangement, revenue is recognized as payments from third parties become due. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $51.0 million, $39.9 million and $26.8 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     In our BioReliance business, we recognized revenue from commercial contracts, which were principally fixed-price or fixed-rate, using the proportional performance method, except for services that were generally completed within three days, which are accounted for using the completed-contract method. Proportional performance was determined using expected output milestones.
     Revenue recorded under proportional performance for projects in process is designed to approximate the amount of revenue earned based on milestones reached within the scope of the contractual arrangement. We undertake a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects.
     We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost-plus-fixed-fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro-rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known.
     Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers is recorded as revenue in the period the related product sales revenue is recognized.
     Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. In preparing these statements, we are required to use estimates and assumptions. While we believe we have considered all available information, actual results could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates, especially in light of the current economic environment. We believe that, of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:

     We translate the financial statements of our non-U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long-term investment nature are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non-U.S. investment.
     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, were approximately $1,620.3 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2007 to our non-U.S. revenues for 2008 would result in approximately $26.9 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. We use derivatives to manage the currency exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. See the Derivatives section for additional information on accounting for derivatives.
     As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $373.0 million and $122.7 million of accounts receivable and $28.9 million and $18.5 million of accounts payable, respectively, denominated in a foreign currency, of which over 99% is denominated in the functional currency of the legal entity which owns the accounts receivable and accounts payable. As a result, the Company does not have any material foreign currency risk exposure in the income statement as a result of these accounts receivable and accounts payable, as changes are run through the currency translation adjustment in other accumulated comprehensive income. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, a hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency rates against the US dollar would result in a reduction or increase of $3.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, upon US dollar settlement of these foreign currency net receivables and payables.
MARKET RISK
     We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results.
     We have operations in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Some of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity's functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables were included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $8.3 million, $0.5 million and $(1.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Foreign Currency Transactions.
     The Company also has intercompany foreign currency receivables and payables primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on these intercompany foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $740.5 million and $27.3 million, respectively, in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2008, which settle in January 2009 through June 2009, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. The Company does not have any material un-hedged foreign currency intercompany receivables or payables at December 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
     At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency intercompany receivables and payables were as follows:
     The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end and does not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.
Cash Flow Hedges
     The ultimate U.S. dollar value of future foreign currency sales generated by our reporting units is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's intent is to limit this exposure from changes in currency exchange rates through hedging. When the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies, the decline in the U.S. dollar value of future foreign currency revenue is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, when the dollar weakens, the opposite occurs. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on forecasted foreign currency sales which are expected to be settled within next twelve months. The change in fair value prior to their maturity was accounted for as cash flow hedges, and recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets according to SFAS 133. To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity was recorded in other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
     At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency sales with third parties were as follows:
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized immaterial net losses related to the ineffective portion of its hedging instruments in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No hedging relationships were terminated as a result of ineffective hedging or forecasted transactions no longer probable of occurring. The Company continuously monitors the probability of forecasted transactions as part of the hedge effectiveness testing. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is reported in prepaid expenses or short term accrued expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as appropriate. The Company reclasses deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income into revenue when the underlying foreign currency sales occur and are recognized in consolidated earnings. The Company uses inventory turnover ratio for each international operating unit to align the timing of a hedged item and a hedging instrument to impact the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the same reporting period. At December 31, 2008, the Company expects to reclass $17.5 million of net loss on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months. At December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease or an increase of $4.8 million in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives accounted under cash flow hedges. Actual gains or losses could differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of currency rate movements.
     Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices.
Commodity Prices.
     Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and derivatives is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers' credit worthiness or our own credit risk. The Company uses credit default swap spread to derive risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the fair value of some of our financial instruments. At December 31, 2008, we had $939.3 million in
Interest Rates.
 
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and long term investments, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $448.4 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at December 31, 2008, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. Any gains or losses derived from the change in fair market value in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment. The Company accounts for $445.5 million of its long term investment in the joint venture along with its equity investments in non-public entities using the equity method thus changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have an impact on these investments. Gain or losses from the changes in market interest rates in other long term investment of $35.6 million will be recognized in our statement of operations immediately, however $35.6 million of securities and the put option would have a limited risk exposure to the changes in market interest rates as such securities' interest rates are reset frequently. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on $35.6 million of our investments.
     The Company entered into $2,650.0 million of credit facilities in November 2008 in conjunction with merger with Applied Biosystems, Inc. The amount of interest payment fluctuates based on London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR. The credit facilities consist of: (1) a revolving credit facility of $250.0 million; (2) a term loan A facility of $1,400.0 million; and (3) a term loan B facility of $1,000.0 million. The credit agreement provides that loans under the Company's revolving credit facility and term loan A will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50%, depending on leverage. The term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3.00% for the first three years beginning November 21, 2008. As an alternative to interest based on LIBOR, the Company may elect to use Bank of America's prime rate instead of LIBOR. If elected, the revolving credit facility and term loan A would bear interest at that prime rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.50%, depending on leverage. If elected for term loan B, interst would be determined based on the prime rate plus a spread of 2.00%. During the year ended 2008, the Company repaid principal of zero and $2.5 million for term loan A and term loan B, respectively.
     Should a change in interest rates occur, due to the nature of the Company's variable rate debt, a 1% change in interest rates would have a pretax impact of $24.0 million on interest expense. To mitigate this risk, subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively reduce the Company's exposure to variations in interest rates.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
     The Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements. For further discussion on the Company's commitments and contingencies, refer to Footnote 6 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Life Technologies Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Life Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule on page 51. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Life Technologies Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Life Technologies Corporation at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. APB 14-1, (FSP APB 14-1) (codified in FASB ASC Topic 470, ) effective as of January 1, 2009 and retroactively adjusted all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements for this change.

1. BUSINESS ACTIVITY, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTS
Business Activity
     Life Technologies Corporation is a global biotechnology tools company dedicated to improving the human condition. Our systems, consumables and services enable researchers to accelerate scientific exploration, driving to discoveries and developments that make life even better. We deliver a broad range of products and services, including systems, instruments, reagents, and custom services. Life Technologies' business is focused on three principal segments: BioDiscovery, Cell Systems, and Applied Biosystems.
Principles of Consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Life Technologies Corporation and its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries collectively referred to as Life Technologies (the Company). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For purposes of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and purchased intangibles amortization and gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by revenues. Operating income is defined as gross profit less operating expenses and operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues.
Discontinued Operations
     Discontinued operations relate to the sale of the Company's BioReliance business unit and the sale of BioSource Europe, S.A.
     In April 2007, Life Technologies completed the sale of its BioReliance subsidiary to Avista Capital Partners and received net cash proceeds of approximately $209.0 million. No loss on the sale was recorded in 2007. The results of operations for BioReliance for the period from January through April 2007 and the results for all prior periods are reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, the Company finalized the sale of BioSource Europe, S.A., a diagnostic business located in Belgium, on February 1, 2007 to a private investor group in Belgium for proceeds of $5.5 million. Net proceeds from both divestitures less cash spent as part of the disposal process were $209.9 million.
     We have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented to reflect BioReliance and BioSource Europe, S.A. as discontinued operations as these businesses meet the criteria as a component of an entity under SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. The components of discontinued operations for the periods presented are as follows:
 
The net liabilities of discontinued operations consisted of the following:
Use of Estimates
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Risks
     Approximately $367.4 million, $343.3 million and $337.9 million, or 23%, 28% and 30% of the Company's product revenues during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were derived from university and research institutions which management believes are, to some degree, directly or indirectly supported by the U.S. Government. If there were to be a significant change in current research funding, particularly with respect to the National Institute of Health, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future revenues and results of operations.
Segment Information
     The Company operates in three segments: BioDiscovery (BD), Cell Systems (CS), and Applied Biosystems (AB). The Company has no intersegment revenues that are material to the overall consolidated financial statements. The Company does not currently segregate assets by segment as a majority of the Company's total assets are shared or considered non-segment assets. The Company has determined that it is not useful to assign its shared assets to individual segments. Based on the aggregation criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," the Company's products and services within a segment share similar economic characteristics, but are different from the economic characteristics of the products and services of the others. As a result of using the aggregation guidelines, there is no logical subgrouping of products within either the segments.
Revenue Recognition
     We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title of the product or performance of services. Concurrently, we record provisions for warranty, returns, and installation based on historical experience and anticipated product performance. Discounts are recorded as sales reductions concurrently with the applicable sale. Cash discounts are recorded as sales reductions on our receipt of the sales proceeds. Transfer of title generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. Revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment of products in situations where risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer at a point other than shipment due to the shipping terms, the existence of an acceptance clause, the achievement of milestones, or some return or cancellation privileges. For sales with acceptance terms, revenue is recognized once customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse. Service revenue is recognized over the period services are performed. In cases where customers order and pay for products or services and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost or perform services over a period of time, we record any material up-front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $118.2 million at December 31, 2008.
     We also enter into arrangements whereby revenues are derived from multiple deliverables. We record revenue as the separate elements are delivered to the customer if the delivered item is determined to represent a separate earnings process, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially in our control. We determine the fair value of the installation process based on technician labor billing rates, the expected number of hours to install the instrument based on historical experience, and amounts charged by third parties. We continually monitor the level of effort required for the installation of our instruments to ensure that appropriate fair values have been determined. Revenues from multiple-element arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received and/or billable in connection with other rights and services that represent our continuing obligations, are deferred until all of the multiple elements have been delivered or until objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements has been established. If objective and verifiable evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exist but objective and verifiable evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method.
 
     We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable during the applicable period based on historical activity, and make revisions for actual royalties received in the following quarter. For those arrangements where royalties cannot be reasonably estimated, we recognize revenue on the receipt of cash or royalty statements from our licensees. In addition, we recognize up-front nonrefundable license fees when due under contractual agreement, unless we have specific continuing performance obligations requiring deferral of all or a portion of these fees. We have adopted the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" for license fees with extended terms. Specifically, if it cannot be concluded that a licensee fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of an arrangement, revenue is recognized as payments from third parties become due. Grant and royalty revenues were $51.0 million, $39.9 million and $26.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost-plus-fixed-fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro-rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known.
     The Company undertakes a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects.
     Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers is recorded as revenue in the period the related product sales revenue is recognized.
Valuation of Financial Instruments
     The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash equivalents, foreign cash accounts, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the convertible notes is determined by using observable market information and valuation methodologies that correlate fair value with the market price of the Company's common stock, and the estimated fair value of the term loans and the secured loan is determined by using observable market information. The fair value of the Company's long term debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (see Note 5 for carrying amounts):
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
     The Company invests its excess cash in marketable securities, money market funds, corporate notes, government securities, highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits, and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. These instruments are readily convertible into cash. The Company has established guidelines that maintain safety and liquidity. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
     All marketable debt and equity securities, other than auction rate securities and the put option (as discussed below), are categorized as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported in other comprehensive income affecting stockholders' equity. Auction rate securities and the put option are categorized as trading securities and any realized gains or losses are reported in other income or loss.
 
     Investments consisted of the following:
     As of December 31, 2008, the Company holds $35.6 million in AAA rated auction rate securities with UBS Investment Bank. Auction rate securities are collateralized long-term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, typically every 7 to 35 days. The underlying assets of the auction rate securities we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Education Loan Program. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for the Company's holdings because sell orders exceeded buy orders. As a result of the failed auctions, the Company is holding illiquid securities because the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. In August 2008, UBS announced that it agreed to a settlement in principle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other state regulatory agencies represented by North American Securities Administrators Association to restore liquidity to all remaining clients who hold auction rate securities. UBS committed to repurchase auction rate securities from their private clients at par beginning January 1, 2009. The Company intends to have this settlement occur between June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2012. Until UBS fully redeems the Company's auction rate securities, UBS will loan to the Company at par without recourse and with accrued interest charges at the same rate as the yields earned on the underlying securities that serve as collateral for the loan. Because the Company has a right to sell its auction rate securities to UBS, this right is considered to be a put option, however, this put option does not meet the definition of derivative under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as auction rate securities are not readily convertible to cash. Thus, this put option will not be subsequently adjusted to fair value each reporting period. To create accounting symmetry for the fair value movement between auction rate securities and the put option, the Company elected the fair value option for the put option in accordance with SFAS 159, , upon the execution of the loan agreement with UBS on the election date in November 2008. In addition, the Company elected a transfer of auction rate securities from available-for-sale securities to trading securities in accordance with SFAS 115, , due to the nature of the current market conditions and the Company's intended holding period.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
     The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the put option will be offset by the changes in the underlying fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The put option will continue to be measured at fair value utilizing Level 3 inputs until the earlier of its maturity or exercise. Upon transferring the auction rate securities from available-for-sale securities to trading securities, the Company reclassed $6.2 million out of accumulative other comprehensive income, net of $2.5 million of deferred tax assets, recognized $6.2 million loss in other expense, and concurrently recognized a $6.2 million gain in other income for the put option. The Company did not record deferred taxes related to the auction rate securities as the combination of the fair value of the securities and the put option equal the Company's cost basis. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company did not recognize a net gain or loss related to the auction rate securities and the related put option. The fair market value of auction rate securities and the put option were $29.4 million and $6.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and are reflected in long term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
     The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization and accretion, interest income and realized gains and losses are included in interest income within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
 
     Maturities and gross unrealized gains (losses) for available for sale securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:
     There were no unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2008. During 2008, we determined that an equity investment was impaired since its fair value is less than its cost. As a result, a $2.6 million other than temporary impairment loss was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.
     The Company adopted SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for financial instruments effective January 1, 2008. The Company did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 for non-financial instruments in the current year due to the deferral period provided by FSP 157-2, . The SFAS 157 framework requires the valuation of investments using a three tiered approach in the valuation of investments. The statement requires fair value measurement be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Fair Value Measurements,
Effective Date of SFAS 157
     Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 derivatives include foreign currency forward contracts for which fair value is determined by using observable market spot rates and forward points adjusted by risk-adjusted discount rates. The risk-adjusted discount rate is derived by U.S. dollar zero coupon yield bonds for corresponding duration of the maturity of derivatives, then adjusted with a counter party default risk for the value of our derivative assets or our credit risk for the value of our derivative liabilities. Credit risk is derived by observable credit default swaps (CDS) spread. Because CDS spread information is not available for our Company, our credit risk is determined by analyzing CDS spreads of similar size public entities in the same industry with similar credit ratings. The value of our derivatives discounted by risk-adjusted discount rates represents the present value of amounts estimated to be received for the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities at the measurement date from a marketplace participant in settlement of these instruments.
     The valuation of money market funds based on Level 3 unobservable inputs consisted of recommended fair values provided by our broker combined with internal analysis of interest rate spreads and credit quality. As a result of having unsecured commercial paper within the Reserve Primary Money Market Fund (Fund), our assessment of the value of the investment is that it is unlikely to fully recover in the foreseeable future given the status of the Fund's underlying investments. Our investment in this asset is valued using Level 3 inputs and significant management judgment. This Fund is in the process of liquidating all remaining assets and will complete this process in the next twelve months. The final published net asset value (NAV) for this Fund was $0.97 per unit. Due to the Fund's management's expectations to liquidate at or above amortized cost, recent cash recoveries from the fund, future expected proceeds and taking into consideration the short-term nature of the Fund's weighted average maturity, management concluded that the $0.97 NAV
 
per unit last published was a reasonable fair value. The valuation of Reserve Primary Money Market Fund as of December 31, 2008 was included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
     All realized gains or losses related to financial instruments whose fair value is determined based on Level 3 inputs are included in other income. All unrealized gains or temporary losses related to financial instruments whose fair value is determined based on Level 3 inputs are included in other comprehensive income. All other than temporary losses are included in other income.
     The following table represents the financial instruments on the financial statements of the Company subject to SFAS 157 and the valuation approach applied to each class of security:
     For those financial instruments with significant Level 3 inputs, the following table summarizes the activity for the year ended December 31, 2008 by investment type:
Foreign Currency Risk and Hedging
     The Company translates the financial statements of its non-U.S. operations using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long-term investment nature are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non-U.S. investment. The cumulative translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity were a net cumulative gain (loss) of $(30.1) million and $129.3 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     Some of the Company's reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity's functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in currency exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $8.3 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. To manage the foreign currency exposure risk, we use derivatives for activities in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. These contracts, which settle in January 2009 through June 2009, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the
 
forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $740.5 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk.
     The Company's international operating units conduct business in, and have a functional currency that differs from the parent entity, and therefore, the ultimate conversion of these sales to cash in U.S. dollars is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency The Company's intent is to limit this exposure from changes in currency exchange rates through hedging. When the dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies, the decline in the US dollar value of future foreign currency revenue is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, when the dollar weakens, the opposite occurs. The Company's currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on forecasted foreign currency sales which are expected to be settled within twelve months. The change in fair value prior to their maturity is accounted for as cash flow hedges, and recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets according to SFAS 133, . To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity was recorded in other income or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities
     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized immaterial net losses related to the ineffective portion of its hedging instruments in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No hedging relationships were terminated as a result of ineffective hedging or forecasted transactions no longer probable of occurring. The Company continuously monitors the probability of forecasted transactions as part of the hedge effectiveness testing. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in prepaid expenses or short term accrued expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as appropriate. The Company reclasses deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income into revenue when the consolidated earnings are impacted or when the inventory was sold to unrelated parties for intercompany sales. The Company uses an inventory turnover ratio for each international operating unit to align the timing of a hedged item and a hedging instrument to impact the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the same reporting period. At December 31, 2008, the Company expects to recognize $17.5 million of net losses on derivative instruments currently classified under accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months.
Concentration of Credit Risk
     The forward contracts used in managing our foreign currency exposures have an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highly-rated domestic and international financial institutions. In the event of non-performance by these counterparties, the carrying values of our financial instruments represent the maximum amount of loss we would have incurred as of our fiscal year-end. However, we do not expect to record any losses as a result of counterparty default. We do not require and are not required to pledge collateral for these financial instruments. Other financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by using highly-rated financial institutions that invest in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. We have established guidelines relative to credit ratings and maturities intended to maintain safety and liquidity. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to our large and diverse customer base, which is dispersed over different geographic areas. Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been within our expectations. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes nor for activities other than risk management, and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives. In addition, we do not carry any master netting arrangements to mitigate the credit risk. The Company continually evaluates the costs and benefits of its hedging program.
Restricted Cash and Related Liabilities
     The Company had restricted cash of $112.4 million held in Rabbi Trusts as of December 31, 2008. Of this $112.4 million, $109.4 million was held in a Rabbi Trust (the AB Trust) which was assumed by the Company upon the closing of its merger with Applied Biosystems. The AB Trust funds several non qualified pension plans of Applera Corporation totaling $58.7 million and termination benefits totaling $51.4 million. The funds are invested primarily in money market accounts. The AB Trust remains in place for the term of benefits payable, which in the case of non qualified pension plans is the death of the participants or their designated beneficiaries. The termination benefits funded by the AB Trust are expected to be paid in full by January 2010. At December 31, 2008, $109.4 million is included in accrued expenses and deferred credits and reserves that are to be funded by the AB
 
Trust. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. No further contributions are required to be made to the AB Trust as of December 31, 2008.
     Restricted cash also consists of $3.0 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and was held in a Rabbi Trust (the Trust). The Trust, which was assumed by the Company upon the closing of its merger with Dexter Corporation (Dexter) in 2000, funds supplemental benefits for certain former employees of Dexter, most of whom did not become employees of the Company. The funds are invested primarily in money market accounts. The Trust is irrevocable and remains in place for the term of benefits payable, which in the case of certain supplemental retirement benefits is the death of the participants or their designated beneficiaries. At December 31, 2008, $2.5 million is included in accrued expenses and deferred credits and reserves that are to be funded by the Trust. No further contributions are required to be made to the Trust.
Accounts Receivable
     The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from a customers' inability to pay. The amount is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers' country or industry, historical losses and customer credit-worthiness. Bad debt expense is recorded as necessary to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for doubtful accounts in general and administrative expense. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year, with certain exceptions determined necessary by management. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the reserve. To date such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management's estimates.
Inventories
     Inventories are generally stated at lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Cost is determined principally on the standard cost method for manufactured goods which approximates cost on the first-in, first-out method. The Company reviews the components of its inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory and makes appropriate dispositions as obsolete inventory is identified. Reserves for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory were $95.5 million and $46.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     Inventories include material, labor and overhead costs in addition to purchase accounting adjustments to write-up acquired inventory to estimated selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance.
     Inventories consist of the following at December 31:
Property and Equipment
     We capitalize major renewals and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend the life of an asset. We expense repairs, maintenance, and minor renewals and improvements as incurred. We remove the cost of assets and related depreciation from the related accounts on the balance sheet when assets are sold, or otherwise disposed of, and any related gains or losses are reflected in current earnings. Leased capital assets are included in property and equipment. Amortization of property and equipment under capital leases is included with depreciation expense. We compute depreciation expense of owned property and equipment based on the expected useful lives of the assets primarily using the straight-line method. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives or the term of the applicable lease, whichever is less.
     Capitalized internal-use software costs include only those direct costs associated with the actual development or acquisition of computer software for internal use, including costs associated with the design, coding, installation and testing of the system. Costs associated with preliminary development, such as the evaluation and selection of alternatives, as well as training, maintenance and support are expensed as incurred. At December 31, 2008 and 2007 the Company has $94.9 million and $60.2 million, respectively, in
 
unamortized capitalized software costs. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company amortized into expense $10.0 million, $9.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, related to capitalized computer software costs.
     Property and equipment consist of the following at December 31:
Goodwill
     Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's segments based on the nature of the product line of the acquired entity. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and earlier if there is an indicator of impairment. Furthermore, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite.
     The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and earlier if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has occurred. The Company utilized a combination of valuation methods including a discounted cash flow analysis and the guideline companies method to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that an impairment does not exist at October 1, 2008, and as a result, no impairment charge has been recorded during the year.
     Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:
     Additions to goodwill acquired during the year were primarily as a result of our acquisitions of Applied Biosystems and CellzDirect. For details on our acquisitions, refer to the "Business Combination" section in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Other Intangible Assets
     Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $86.9 million, $98.7 million and $110.7 million, respectively. In conjunction with acquisitions (see Note 2Business Combinations), $93.3 million, zero and zero of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     Intangible assets consist of the following:
     Estimated amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets owned as of December 31, 2008 for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles
     The Company reviews long-lived assets and intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We periodically re-evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of its long-lived assets. The criteria used for these evaluations include management's estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible asset in the Company's business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, which is determined by applicable market prices, when available. There was no impairment loss recognized for long-lived assets (excluding goodwill) during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
Product Warranties
     We accrue warranty costs for product sales at the time of shipment based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance. Our product warranties extend over a specified period of time ranging up to two years from the date of sale depending on the product subject to warranty. The product warranty accrual covers parts and labor for repairs and replacements covered by our product warranties. We periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve, and adjust, if necessary, the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred.
 
Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
     Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following at December 31:
Research and Development Costs
     Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs incurred for collaborations where there are specific product deliverables, service meeting defined performances or other design specifications, are recorded in cost of sales. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 research and development expenses in operating expense were $142.5 million, $115.8 million and $104.3 million.
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation
     The Company accounts for share based compensation using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), (SFAS 123R). Under this method, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period for all share-based awards granted, modified or cancelled as of January 1, 2006.
Share-Based Payment
Income Taxes
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
     Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return. The cumulative effects of applying this interpretation were to record a decrease of $1.5 million to retained earnings, an increase of $2.7 million to net deferred income taxes, a decrease to goodwill of $1.1 million and an increase of $3.1 million to income taxes payable in 2007 upon adoption.
Computation of Earnings Per Share
     Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from the following items:
 
     Computations for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
     Accumulated other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses that are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are reported as a separate component in stockholders' equity. The unrealized gains and losses include foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments, unrealized gains or losses on hedging of forecasted foreign currency cash flows and adjustments to the minimum pension liability, net of tax. The minimum pension liability adjustment represents the excess of the additional pension liability over the unrecognized prior service cost.
     Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following at December 31,
Reclassifications
     Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current year presentation. Accrued expenses have been reclassified at a more detailed level and segment information from 2007 has been adjusted approximately $2.9 million to better reflect the way management views the business. The Company also has reclassified on the balance sheet the classification of the Mass Spectrometry joint venture to comply with the treatment under APB 18, , in the current period. As a result of this adjustment, which did not impact the income statement, the Company has reclassified $357.4 million from goodwill and $88.1 million from intangible assets to long term investments.

Employers' Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
     In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF 07-5, , which addresses the accounting for certain instruments as derivatives under SFAS 133, . The Company currently has outstanding convertible debt with embedded features which are considered indexed to the entity's own stock and as a stand alone instrument would have been included in stockholders' equity, and therefore subject to a scope exception in SFAS 133. Under this new pronouncement, specific guidance is provided regarding requirements for an entity to consider embedded features as indexed to the entity's own stock. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Based on the Company's review of the pronouncement, the Company does not believe the guidance will have an impact on our financial statements.

     In March 2008, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 161, , which provides for additional disclosure and documentation surrounding derivative positions and hedging activity. The statement is applicable for all fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is encouraged. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
     In December 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 160, , which impacts the accounting for noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements of filers. The statement requires the reclassification of noncontrolling interest from the liabilities section or the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity to the equity section of the balance sheet. The statement also requires that the results from operations attributed to the noncontrolling interest to be disclosed separately from those of the parent. In addition, the accounting for and reporting for deconsolidated subsidiaries will change as a result of adopting this statement. The statement which is applicable for all fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will require prospective treatment. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51
     In December 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141R, , which impacts the accounting for business combinations. The statement requires changes in the measurement of assets and liabilities required in favor of a fair value method consistent with the guidance provided in SFAS 157 (see below). Additionally, the statement requires a change in accounting for certain acquisition related expenses and business adjustments which no longer are considered part of the purchase price. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption of this standard is not permitted. The statement requires prospective application for all acquisitions after the date of adoption. The statement will require changes in the accounting for acquisition costs, restructuring costs, in process research and development and the resolution of certain acquired tax items. As a result, the adoption of the statement could have a material impact on the future operations of the Company based on future acquisitions and changes in estimates and unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities related to pre-existing business combination transactions.
Business Combinations
     In February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 159, which allows entities to account for most financial instruments at fair value rather than under other applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as historical cost. The accounting results in the instrument being marked to fair value every reporting period with the gain/loss from a change in fair value recorded in the income statement. The Company adopted this standard in the current year without any material impact to the financial statements.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,
     In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Adoption of this statement for non-financial assets and liabilities is required for an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2008 due to the deferral period provided by FSP 157-2, . The Company adopted this standard for financial assets and liabilities in the current year without any material impact to the financial statements.

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions
Merger with Applied Biosystems, Inc.
     On June 11, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Applied Biosystems, Inc. (AB), formerly known as Applera Corporation, under which the Company acquired all outstanding shares of AB in a cash and stock transaction. AB is a global leader in the development and marketing of instrument-based systems, consumables, software, and services for academic research, the life science industry and commercial markets. AB commercializes innovative technology solutions for DNA, RNA, protein and small molecule analysis. Customers across the disciplines of academic and clinical research, pharmaceutical research and manufacturing, forensic DNA analysis, and agricultural biotechnology use AB's tools and services to accelerate scientific discovery, improve processes related to drug discovery and development, detect potentially pathogenic microorganisms, and identify individuals based on DNA sources. AB has a comprehensive service and field applications support team for a global installed base of high-performance genetic and protein analysis solutions. The merger enables the two companies to broaden their customer offering to include a full range of instruments, equipment, reagents, consumables and services.
     The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of AB stock would be converted into the right to receive either a combination of cash and shares of Life Technologies common stock or all cash or all shares of Life Technologies common stock, in each case subject to the election and allocation procedures laid out in the prospectus as selected by the shareholder. The consideration was based on the 20 day weighted average price of the Company immediately preceding the merger date. Based on the weighted average closing prior to the merger the ultimate consideration paid under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) abstract 99-12, the value was $22.25 per share with $1,798.6 million paid in stock and $3,229.2 million paid in cash and $23.8 million related to the exchange of Applied Biosystems stock options for Life Technologies stock options.
Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination,
     Upon the completion of the merger, AB's shareholders owned approximately 46.6 percent of the combined company. As a result of the Company owning more than a majority of the combined company, the premium paid to AB shareholders and a majority of the management and board of the Company representing senior management, the Company is considered to be the acquirer for accounting purposes.
     Had the merger with AB been completed as of the beginning of 2007, the Company's pro forma results for 2008 and 2007 would have been as follows:
     The primary adjustments relate to the purchase accounting impacts of the acquired intangible assets and increased debt load associated with the acquisition. The above pro forma information was determined based on historical GAAP results adjusted for the purchase price allocation and estimated related changes in income associated with the merger of Applied Biosystems. Excluded from the proforma results are purchase accounting adjustments related to in process research and development, the fair market value adjustment of inventory and deferred revenue as these adjustments do not reflect ongoing operations. Additionally, the Company excluded the impact of the expense associated with the acceleration of equity vesting and discontinuation of hedging relationships associated with the Applied Biosystems merger as these adjustments do not reflect ongoing operations as if the Companies merged on January 1, 2007.
     The Company's results for 2008 and 2007 would not have been materially different from its reported results had its other acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2007.
 
     The Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price. The Company expects to complete the allocation of purchase price during fiscal year 2009. The components of the preliminary purchase price allocation for AB are as follows:
 
     The acquired identified intangible assets with definite lives from the merger with AB are as follows:
     The weighted-average amortization periods for intangible assets with definite lives are: 12 years for customer relationships, 7 years for product technology, 9 years for tradenames and 5 years for acquired PCR Royalty contracts. The weighted-average amortization period for all intangible assets with definite lives acquired in the merger with AB is 10 years. The acquired purchase technology relates to Applied Biosystems Molecular Cell Biology business which includes the SOLiD high throughput instruments and consumables, Genomic assays technology for both research and applied markets, functional analysis and the Proteomics and Small Molecule business which includes Mass Spectrometry. The acquired tradenames primarily relate to the acquired Applied Biosystems and Ambion tradenames.
     The Company has allocated $65.4 million of the purchase price of AB to purchased in-process research and development. This amount estimates the fair value of various acquired in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have future alternative use as of the date of the merger. The in-process research and development is primarily related to the ongoing research projects which seek to enhance the Company's current technology platform. The Company has included this allocated value into expense as a separate line item on the financial statements as of the date of the merger.
     The Company has assigned value to identifiable intangible assets and purchased in-process research and development based on the income approach, specifically the royalty relief method. The method is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to enjoy the benefits of the asset. Under this method, the value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset.
     The purchased price exceeded the value of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets, and therefore the Company has allocated $2,448.4 million to goodwill. Of this allocation of purchase price to goodwill, none is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Included in the goodwill amount is $918.0 million related to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the inability to deduct intangible amortization expense associated with the merger. The Company's cost basis in the intangible assets is zero requiring an adjustment to the deferred tax liability to properly capture the Company's ongoing tax rate. The remainder of the goodwill balance is related to estimated synergies in the purchase price and non-capitalizable intangible assets (i.e. employee workforce) acquired in association with the acquisition. The Company anticipates cost savings and revenue synergies as the result of the combination of the two businesses. The cost savings are expected to be driven by operating efficiencies and elimination of redundant positions as well as the elimination of duplicate facilities. Revenue synergies are expected to be driven by increased market presence and leveraging of the combination of the combination of reagent and instrument sales platforms.
     As part of the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, the Company acquired a joint venture, Applied Biosystems/MDS Analytical Technologies Instruments, in which the Company is a 50% owner of. The Company accounts for its investment in the joint venture using the equity method, consistent with the guidance in APB No. 18, , based on the circumstances where the Company is unable to influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee, shares in the risks and rewards of all related business activities and the joint venture is a stand alone legal entity. Prior to the acquisition, Applied Biosystems accounted for the operations of the joint venture on a gross basis. As a result, the Company has adjusted the historical pro forma information to comply with the equity method. The Company accounts for the results of the joint venture in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the "other income/(expense)" line. The Company accounts for non-operating and stand alone assets and liabilities, which includes goodwill and intangibles associated with the acquisition, of the joint venture in the "long term investment" line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company continues to assign value and allocate the purchase price to the various acquired components of the Applied Biosystems merger, including the valuation of the acquired joint venture. Due to the nature of the joint venture, with sales, distribution and service commingled with the Company's operations, operating assets and liabilities specifically related to the joint venture are commingled or inseparable. As a result, for operating assets and liabilities the Company records these assets in the functional operating asset and liability classifications which represent the underlying asset or liability and do not record these assets or liabilities in the "long term investment" account
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock
     The Company has undertaken restructuring activities in connection with the AB acquisition. These activities, which have been accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95-3, "" have primarily included one-time personnel benefit costs, specifically severance costs related to
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination
 
duplicative positions and change in control agreements, to mostly manufacturing, finance and research and development employees of AB. The restructuring plan does also include charges associated with closure of certain AB leased facilities and other one-time personnel benefit costs to AB employees, specifically relocation costs. The Company currently continues to finalize its restructuring plan in connection with the AB acquisition. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3, the Company will finalize its restructuring plan no later than one year from the date of the AB acquisition. Upon finalization of the restructuring plan for less than the expected amount, any excess reserves are reversed with a corresponding decrease in goodwill. Upon finalization of the restructuring plan exceeding the expected amount, any additional costs will be recorded in business consolidation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
     The following table summarizes the restructuring activity in connection with the AB acquisition during the fourth quarter 2008, as well as the remaining restructuring accrual in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008:
Other Acquisitions
     During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company completed several additional acquisitions that were not material to the overall consolidated financial statements and the results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of the acquisitions.
     On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CellzDirect, Inc. (CellzDirect), a privately held company based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. CellzDirect, founded in 2001, provides hepatocyte-based cell products and related services used in the testing of new drugs. CellzDirect has approximately 99 employees at its sites located in North Carolina and Texas. The Company does not believe this to be a material acquisition. The Company paid cash of approximately $57.3 million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CellzDirect. The purchase price paid was allocated to identifiable intangible assets of $26.8 million, fair market value adjustment of acquired inventory of $3.0 million and other net assets acquired of $4.7 million. As a result of non-deductible fair value adjustments of acquired intangibles and acquired inventory, deferred tax liabilities of $10.6 million and $3.1 million were recorded, respectively. In addition the Company recorded $3.6 million of deferred tax assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired of approximately $32.9 million was assigned to goodwill. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of five to seven years. The fair market value adjustment of acquired inventory will be recognized in the statement of operations based on the sales of acquired inventory.
     The Company completed two additional acquisitions in 2008 for the combined purchase price of $31.2 million. Both acquisitions were for immaterial companies considered development stage enterprises, and therefore, the transactions have been accounted for as asset purchases. For tax purposes, the transactions were treated as a taxable stock acquisition. The Company recorded aggregate net assets, including acquired intangibles, and in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $3.3 million and $27.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2008 with respect to these acquisitions.
     The Company completed two acquisitions in 2007 for the combined purchase price of $23.1 million in cash and one acquisition in 2006 for $15.1 million in cash. The Company does not believe these acquisitions to be material to the Company.
Business Consolidation Costs
     The Company continues to integrate recent acquisitions into its operations and recorded approximately $38.6 million, $5.6 million and $12.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to these efforts. The expenses in 2008 primarily relate to business consolidation efforts, including integration planning associated with the Applied Biosystems merger. Costs associated with 2007 and 2006 relate primarily to the severance and other costs associated with consolidation of acquired entities.

4. LINES OF CREDIT
     As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, China, India, Japan, and Norway had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short-term working capital requirements. The credit facilities bear interest at fixed rates, the respective bank's prime rate, the London LIBOR rate, the Norwegian NIBOR rate and the Japan TIBOR rate. The weighted average interest rate of these lines of credit were 5.28% and 3.64% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Under these lines of credit, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $13.4 million and $21.4 million, of which $0.3 and $0.9 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, the Company's Japan subsidiary has an outstanding letter of credit which had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.1 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to support its import duty.
     On November 21, 2008, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility of $250.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility) with Bank of America, N.A, thereby cancelling its senior secured credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. entered into on January 9, 2006. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are determined by reference to LIBOR or to an alternate base rate, with margins determined based on changes in the Company's leverage ratio. Under the credit agreement governing the Company's new credit facilities, the Company has the right to make up to three requests to increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility and/or term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount for all such requests of up to $500.0 million, provided certain conditions are met. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants and conditions of default customary for financings of this type. The Company currently anticipates using the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility for the purpose of general working capital and capital expenditures and/or other capital needs as they may arise. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has issued $12.9 million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, and accordingly, the remaining available credit is $237.1 million.
5. LONG-TERM DEBT
     Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:
     Maturities of the long-term debt listed above at December 31, 2008, are as follows:
 
Term Loan A and Term Loan B
     On November 21, 2008, the Company entered into $2,650 million of credit facilities consisting of: (1) a revolving credit facility of $250 million; (2) a term loan A facility of $1,400 million; and (3) a term loan B facility of $1,000 million. The Company's credit facilities are governed by a credit agreement among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents, DnB Nor Bank, ASA and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Co-Documentation Agents, and other lender parties thereto. The proceeds of the term loan facilities, together with other sources, were used to finance (1) the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to stockholders of Applied Biosystems, (2) costs and expenses related to the merger transactions, (3) the repayment of, and termination of all commitments to make extensions of credit under certain of the Company's and Applied Biosystems' existing indebtedness, which did not include the Company's existing convertible notes and certain other indebtedness, and (4) the Company's ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes after the merger. At the effective time of the merger, the Company borrowed the entire amount available under the term loan facilities. The Company's $250.0 million syndicated secured credit facility entered into on January 9, 2006 with Bank of America N.A terminated in connection with the entry into the Company's new credit facilities.
     The credit agreement provides that loans under the credit facilities bear interest based on the LIBOR or, if the Company so elects, on Bank of America's Base Rate. For the revolving credit facility and the term loan A, interest is computed based on the Company's leverage ratio as shown below:
     From the closing date, November 21, 2008, to the date on which the Administrative Agent receives a compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending in 2009, the interst on the revolving credit facility and term loan A will be Pricing Level 1. Term loan B bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3.00% for the first three years after the closing date, or, if the Company so elects, at Base Rate plus 2.00%. In association with the term loan agreement, the Company is required to swap three years of $800.0 million in variable rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments within 90 days of the signing of the agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2008 and within the 90 day window, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to comply with this requirement.
     The Company must repay 1.25% of the principal amount of the term loan A in each quarter of 2009, 2.5% in each quarter of 2010 and 2011, 3.75% in each quarter of 2012 and 15% in each quarter of 2012 with the final payment of all amounts outstanding under the term loan A facility, plus accrued interest, due on November 21, 2012. The Company must repay, in each quarter, beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2008, 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loan B, with the final payment of the remaining term loan B due on November 21, 2015. The Company can prepay the term loans without penalty. The revolving credit facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder, plus accrued interest, will be due on November 21, 2013. During the year ended 2008, the Company repaid principal of zero and $2.5 million for term loan A and term loan B, respectively. Costs incurred to issue the debt under the credit facility totaled $43.5 million for term loan A, $41.0 million for term loan B, and $7.8 million for the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company amortized debt issuance costs of $0.8 million , $0.8 million, and $0.2 million for term loan A, term loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the unamortized balances of the issuance costs were $42.6 million, $40.3 million, and $7.6 million for term loan A, term loan B, and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively.
     The Company's credit agreement requires the loans to be prepaid with a portion of the net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course sales or other dispositions of property and assets and casualty proceeds, condemnation awards and certain other extraordinary receipts, subject to exceptions. The portion of such net cash proceeds to be applied to prepayments of loans will be determined based on our leverage ratio, with 100% to be applied if the leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00x; 50% if the leverage ratio is less than 3.00x and greater than or equal to 2.50x; and 0% if the leverage ratio is less than 2.50x. Loans under the Company's credit facilities will also be required to be prepaid with 100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of new debt (other than certain debt permitted by the credit agreement). These mandatory prepayments will be applied to the repayment of the term facilities as the Company directs.
 
     The credit agreement allows the Company to make certain investments and share repurchases, subject to restrictions based on leverage. If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00x, the Company may spend up to $500.0 million annually on acquisitions and share repurchases in any fiscal year. If the Company's leverage ratio less than 3.00x, there is no limit to investments in acquisitions. However, the Company's maximum share repurchases will be $500.0 million in any fiscal year.
     The credit agreement governing the Company's new credit facilities contains financial maintenance covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. These financial maintenance covenants apply beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009. Initially, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.25x. This maximum leverage ratio reduces on a quarterly schedule to 3.75x by December 31, 2009 and to 3x by December 31, 2010. After December 31, 2010, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00x. The Company will be also be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.75x. The credit agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company's and its subsidiaries, subject to materiality and other qualifications and exceptions.
     Obligations under the Company's credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default as defined in the credit agreement, including failure to pay any principal when due and payable, failure to pay interest within three business days after due, failure to comply with any covenant, representation or condition of any loan document or swap contract, any change of control, cross-defaults, and certain other events as set forth in the credit agreement, with grace periods in some cases.
     The Company's obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by each of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and are collateralized by substantially all of the Company's and its guarantor subsidiaries' assets.
Secured Loan
     At December 31, 2008 the Company holds $35.6 million in AAA rated auction rate securities. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for the Company's holdings because sell orders exceeded buy orders. As a result of the failed auctions, the Company is holding illiquid securities because the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. In August, 2008, UBS announced that it has agreed to a settlement in principle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other state regulatory agencies represented by North American Securities Administrators Association to restore liquidity to all remaining clients who hold auction rate securities. UBS committed to repurchase auction rate securities from their private clients at par beginning January 1, 2009. The Company intends to have this settlement between June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2012. Until UBS fully redeems the Company's auction rate securities, UBS will loan to the Company at par without recourse with accrued interest charge at the same rate as the yields earned on the underlying securities that serve as collateral for the loan. For information on auction rate securities, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Convertible Debt
     On June 20, 2005, the Company sold 3 /% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 3 /% Notes) to certain qualified institutional investors at par value. Including the exercise of the over-allotment option, the total size of the offering was $350.0 million. After expenses, net proceeds to the Company were $343.0 million.

     Interest is payable on the 3 /% Notes semi-annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the 3 /% Notes may be required to be paid per six-month period beginning June 15, 2011, if the market value of the 3 /% Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the 3 /% Notes' principal value. The 3 /% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the 3 /% Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 3 /% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Prepayment of amounts due under the 3 /% Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the 3 /% Notes' principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, the Company's default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in the 3 /% Notes or indenture, or upon cross-default by the Company or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of other debt of the Company or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50.0 million.

     In February 2004 and August 2003, the Company issued $450.0 million principal amount of 1 /% Convertible Senior Notes (the Old 1 /% Notes) due February 15, 2024 and $350.0 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (the Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023 to certain qualified institutional buyers, respectively. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds of $440.1 million and $340.7 million for the Old 1 /% Notes and Old 2% Notes, respectively. Interest on the Old Notes was payable semi-annually on February 15th and 1st and August 15th and 1st, for the Old 1 /% Notes and the Old 2% Notes, respectively. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 /% and 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old Notes may have been required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012 and August 1, 2010, if the market value of the Old Notes during specified testing periods was 120% or more of the principle value, for the Old 1 /% Notes and the Old 2% Notes, respectively. This contingent interest feature was an embedded derivative with a de minimis value, to which no value had been assigned at issuance of either of the Old Notes or as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Old Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and were convertible shares of common stock at the option of the holder, subject to certain conditions described below, at a price of $51.02 and $34.12 per share for the Old 1 /% Notes and Old 2% Notes, respectively. The Old Notes were to be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option on or after February 15, 2012 (for the Old 1 /% Notes) and August 1, 2010 (for the Old 2% Notes) at 100% of the principal amount. In addition, the holders of the Old Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Old Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on three separate dates per their issuance agreement.

     The Old Notes also contained restricted convertibility features that did not affect the conversion price of the notes but, instead, placed restrictions on the holder's ability to convert their notes into shares of the Company's common stock (conversion shares). Holders were able to convert their Old Notes into shares of the Company's common stock prior to stated maturity.
     During December 2004, the Company offered up to $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non-cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 98% or $342.4 million of the Old 2% Notes has been exchanged by their holders for New 2% Notes as of December 31, 2008.
     During December 2004, the Company offered up to $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1 /% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 /% Notes) in a non-cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 /% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 99% or $446.1 million of the Old 1 /% Notes has been exchanged by their holders for New 1 /% Notes as of December 31, 2008.

     The New 2% Notes and New 1 /% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 /% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following: the terms of the New Notes require the Company to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the excess, if any, of the notes' conversion value (based on conversion prices of $34.12 and $51.02 for the New 2% Notes and New 1 /% Notes, respectively) over their par values. As such, EITF 90-19 and 04-8 required the Company to use the treasury stock equivalent method to calculate diluted earnings per share, as if the New Notes were outstanding since date of issuance, the date the Old Notes were issued.

     Costs incurred to issue the convertible notes totaled $7.6 million for the 3 /% Notes, $9.3 million for the Old 1 /% Notes, and $9.3 million for the Old 2% Notes. Finance costs (excluding legal and accounting fees) incurred to conduct the exchange of the Old Notes totaled $1.8 million ($0.8 million related to the Old 2% Notes and $1.0 million related to the Old 1 /% Notes). These costs have been deferred and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the terms of the respective debt using the effective interest method. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the unamortized balances of the issuance costs were $7.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively.

     Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP APB 14-1 with the retrospective application to our outstanding $1,150 million of Convertible Senior Notes, consisting of $350.0 million related to the 2% Convertible Senior Note (2023 Note), $450.0 million related to the 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Note (2024 Note) and $350.0 million related to the 3 1/4% Convertible Senior Note (2025 Note). Upon adoption of the new accounting principle, the Company retroactively recognized $100.0 million, $129.8 million, and $47.6 million for the equity components of the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, respectively; deferred tax liabilities of $39.1 million,
 
$50.7 million and $18.6 million for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, respectively; and liability components classified in long-term debt of $250.0 million, $320.2 million and $302.4 million for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, respectively.
     At December 31, 2008 the Company carries unamortized debt discounts of $27.2 million, $58.1 million and $21.9 million for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. The Company recognized total interest cost of $65.3 million, $62.7 million and $60.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, based on the effective interest rates of 7.21%, 6.10% and 5.95% for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, respectively. The interest expense consisted of $25.1 million of contractual interest based on the stated coupon rate for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, and $40.2 million, $37.6 million and $35.3 million of amortization of the discount on the liability components for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Notes, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     As a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company allocated $6.9 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Convertible Senior Notes to equity.
 
6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases
     The Company leases certain equipment and office and manufacturing facilities under operating leases, which expire through December 2048. Certain rental commitments provide for escalating rental payments and certain commitments have renewal options extending through various years. Rent expense under operating leases was $24.4 million, $22.1 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sublease income totaled $1.3 million, $2.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.
     Future minimum lease commitments and sublease rentals for operating leases at December 31, 2008 are as follows:
     The Company does not have any material remaining unfavorable lease liabilities from previous acquisitions.
Guarantees
     There are three types of guarantees related to our business activities that are included in the scope of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, which are leases with recourse provisions, the guarantee of pension benefits for a divested business, and product warranties.
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
Leases
     We provide lease-financing options to our customers through third party financing companies. For some leases, the financing companies have recourse to us for any unpaid principal balance on default by the customer. The leases typically have terms of two to three years and are secured by the underlying instrument. In the event of default by a customer, we would repossess the underlying instrument. We record revenues from these transactions on the completion of installation and acceptance of products and maintain a reserve for estimated losses on all lease transactions with recourse provisions based on historical default rates and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2008, the financing companies' outstanding balance of lease receivables with recourse to us was $5.5 million. We believe that we could recover the entire balance from the resale of the underlying instruments in the event of default by all customers.
Pension Benefits
     As part of the Applied Biosystems' divestiture of the Analytical Instruments business in fiscal 1999, the purchaser of the Analytical Instruments business is paying for the pension benefits for employees of a former German subsidiary. However, we guaranteed payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so, as these payment obligations were not transferable to the buyer under German law. The guaranteed payment obligation, which approximated $49.5 million at December 31, 2008, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Product Warranties
     We accrue warranty costs for product sales at the time of shipment based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance. Our product warranties extend over a specified period of time ranging up to two years from the date of sale depending on the product subject to warranty. The product warranty accrual covers parts and labor for repairs and replacements covered by our product warranties. We periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve, and adjust, if necessary, the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred. At December 31, 2008, outstanding balance of product warranties was $12.6 million.
 
     The following table provides the analysis of the warranty reserve for the periods ended December 31:
Indemnifications
     In the normal course of business, we enter into some agreements under which we indemnify third parties for intellectual property infringement claims or claims arising from breaches of representations or warranties. In addition, from time to time, we provide indemnity protection to third parties for claims relating to past performance arising from undisclosed liabilities, product liabilities, environmental obligations, representations and warranties, and other claims. In these agreements, the scope and amount of remedy, or the period in which claims can be made, may be limited. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, due under these indemnities due to the conditional nature of the obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have not been material to our consolidated financial position.
Licensing and Purchasing Agreements
     The Company develops, manufactures and sells certain products under several licensing and purchasing agreements. The licensing agreements require royalty payments based upon various percentages of sales or profits from the products. Terms of the licensing agreements generally range from the remaining life of the patent up to twenty years and initial costs are amortized over periods from seven to ten years, not to exceed their terms, using various methods, including the straight-line method. Total royalty expense under these agreements was $38.6 million, $32.5 million and $27.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company also has purchase agreements, which expire on various dates through 2013, under which it is obligated to purchase a minimum amount of raw materials and finished goods each year through the expiration of the contracts and certain capital expenditure commitments. Purchases under these contracts and capital commitments totaled $11.5 million in 2008, $15.0 million in 2007 and $3.3 million in 2006.
     To maintain exclusivity, certain of the licensing agreements require guaranteed minimum annual royalty payments. Future minimum guaranteed royalties and unconditional purchase obligations at December 31, 2008 are as follows:
Letters of Credit
     The Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $39.2 million at December 31, 2008, of which $10.5 million was to support liabilities associated with the Company's self-insured worker's compensation programs, $4.8 million was to support its building lease requirements, $22.8 million was to support performance bond agreements, and $1.1 million was to support duty on imported products.
 
Executive Employment Agreements
     The Company has employment contracts with key executives that provide for the continuation of salary if terminated for reasons other than cause, as defined in those agreements. At December 31, 2008, future employment contract commitments for such key executives were approximately $26.6 million. In certain circumstances, the employment agreements call for the acceleration of equity vesting. Those figures are not reflected in the above information.
Contingent Acquisition Obligations
     As of December 31, 2008, pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments of approximately $62.5 million based on the achievement of certain operating results of the acquired companies. Several purchase agreements do not limit the payments to a maximum amount, nor do they restrict the payments deadline.
     None of the contingent payments were earned or paid for the achievement of operating results in 2008, and $2.0 million of contingent payments were earned and paid for the achievement of operating results in 2007. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, zero and $51.5 million, respectively, of contingent payments for operating results have expired. The payments have been accounted for as an addition to the purchase price of the acquired company in accordance with SFAS 141.
Environmental Liabilities
     As a result of the merger with Applied Biosystems Inc., the Company assumed certain environmental exposures. At December 31, 2008, the environmental reserves, which are not discounted, were approximately $3.6 million, including current reserves of $3.4 million. In addition, some of the assumed environmental reserves are covered under insurance policies. At December 31, 2008, the Company also has receivables of approximately $1.6 million, including $1.4 million in short-term, for expected reimbursements under the insurance policies.
     The Company assumed certain environmental exposures as a result of the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and recorded reserves to cover estimated environmental clean-up costs. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, were $6.7 million at December 31, 2008 and include current reserves of $0.8 million, which are estimated to be paid during the next year, and long-term reserves of $5.9 million. In addition, the Company has an insurance policy to cover certain assumed environmental exposures. Based upon currently available information, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for these environmental exposures and that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations.
Intellectual Properties
     The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including protection of its owned and licensed intellectual property. The Company accrues for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability is incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Specific contingent liabilities for royalty obligations related to acquired businesses have been recorded on the Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2008.
Litigation
     The Company is subject to other potential liabilities under government regulations and various claims and legal actions that are pending or may be asserted. These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of the Company's business, as well as through acquisitions and some are expected to be covered, at least partly, by insurance. Claim estimates that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are reflected as liabilities of the Company. The ultimate resolution of these matters is subject to many uncertainties. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters, which are pending or may be asserted, could be decided unfavorably to the Company. Although the amount of liability at December 31, 2008, with respect to these matters cannot be ascertained, the Company believes that any resulting liability should not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
7. INCOME TAXES
     The differences between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate are as follows for the years ended December 31:
Pretax income summarized by region for the years ended December 31 is as follows:
The income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following for the years ended December 31:
     Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are composed of the following at December 31:
 
     In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), , an interpretation of SFAS 109, . FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, tax benefits shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. FIN 48 also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of this interpretation are required to be adopted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted this provision beginning January 1, 2007. Net impact due to the adoption of FIN 48 was $1.5 million decrease to retained earnings.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
Accounting for Income Taxes
     The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits:
     When combined with interest and federal benefit when recognized, the $74.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits become $65.9 million in net unrecognized tax benefits, and of which, $62.4 million would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate, if recognized after the measurement period. In conjunction with the adoption of FIN 48, the Company has classified uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid in one year. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated statement of operations was $3.2 million, and $4.2 million in the consolidated statement of financial position.
     The Company is subject to routine compliance reviews on various tax matters around the world in the ordinary course of business. Currently, audits are occurring in China, Japan, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. The United States' audit cycle for the consolidated income tax returns for the years ended 2006 and 2007 is expected to be completed in 2010. After the 2006-2007 audit cycle, the remaining year subject to federal examination is 2008.
     While the Company has provided $98.6 million of taxes related to certain foreign unremitted earnings that are due to be repatriated to finance the AB merger, taxes on approximately $257.5 million of other undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries have not been provided for at December 31, 2008. The Company only remits current earnings that can be repatriated without a material impact on the provision for income taxes and are considered to be in excess of the reasonably anticipated working capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries. Any remaining undistributed earnings are considered permanently invested in the operations of such subsidiaries. It is not practical to determine the amount of income tax payable in the event we repatriated all undistributed foreign earnings.
     On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS 123R. Under SFAS 123R all share-based compensation is required to be recognized as an expense, and the tax benefit associated with such compensation will continue to be credited to additional paid-in-capital, but only to the extent the tax benefits has not already been recognized in the Statement of Operations. The tax benefit associated with employee stock plans are estimated to reduce taxes payable by $2.4 million, $20.2 million and $3.1 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These benefits have been reflected as additional paid-in-capital in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.
     At December 31, 2008, the Company had $44.3 million and $12.2 million of federal and foreign net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, respectively, that were obtained from acquired companies throughout the years. It is not more likely than not that the Company can fully realize certain states' NOLs. There were also federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $61.5 million. The federal and state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2019 and 2009, respectively. The tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2012.
 
     The valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets increased by $26.7 million in 2008. The increase is primarily due to operating losses and credit carryovers acquired by the Company through acquisitions completed through 2008.
     The Company has a tax exemption grant for its manufacturing operations in Singapore, which expires in 2014. The tax benefit realized at the local statutory level in 2008 is $2.2 million; however, no benefit is being recognized currently at the consolidated level as the tax savings are offset by the taxes provided on foreign unremitted earnings discussed above.
8. COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN
Common Stock Authorized Shares
     The Company has authorized 400 million shares of common stock.
Preferred Stock Authorized Shares
     The Company has authorized 6,405,884 shares of preferred stock of which no shares were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Upon issuance, the Company has the ability to define the terms of the preferred shares, including voting rights, liquidation preferences, conversion and redemption provisions and dividend rates.
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan
     The Company has a Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan under which stockholders received one "right" to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series B Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of common stock held of record at the close of business on March 30, 2001. The rights, which will initially trade with the common stock, become exercisable to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, at $250.00 per right, when a person acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock or announces a tender offer which could result in such person owning 15% or more of the common stock. Each one one-hundredth of a share of Series B Preferred Stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock. Prior to a person acquiring 15%, the rights can be redeemed for $0.001 each by action of the Board of Directors. Under certain circumstances, if a person acquires 15% or more of the common stock, the rights permit the Company stockholders other than the acquirer to purchase the Company's common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of the rights, in lieu of the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, in the event of certain business combinations, the rights permit purchase of the common stock of an acquirer at a 50% discount. Rights held by the acquirer will become null and void in both cases. The rights expire on April 1, 2011. The rights distribution will not be taxable to stockholders.
Stock Repurchase Program
     In July 2007, the Board approved a program authorizing management to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock over the next three years. Under the 2007 plan, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total cost of approximately $135.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 1.2 million shares at a total cost of approximately $100.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders' equity.
9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
401(k) Profit Sharing Plans
     The Company's 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan allows each eligible employee to voluntarily make pre-tax deferred salary contributions subject to regulatory and plan limitations. The Company may make matching contributions in amounts as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company made matching contributions of $5.1 million, $4.6 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to this plan.
     The Company assumed a 401(k) savings plan in conjunction with its acquisition of Applied Biosystems. The Applied Biosystems' 401(k) plan covers domestic employees that were employed by Applied Biosystems prior to its acquisition by the Company and new hires of the Company that work for Applied Biosytems. The Applied Biosystems' 401(k) plan is expected to be merged with the Company's 401(k) Savings and Invesetment Plan to form a single benefit plan effective January 1, 2010. The plan offers a dollar-for-dollar matching of up to 6% salary contributions for participants. Contributions to this plan, net of plan forfeitures, were $0.9 million for the period ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, the Company recorded expenses for Applied Biosystems' foreign defined contribution plans of $0.3 million for the period ended December 31, 2008.
 
Pension Plans
     Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, . Under SFAS No. 158, the Company is required to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 158 also requires the measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. The Company's existing policy required us to measure the funded status of our plans as of the balance sheet date; accordingly, the new measurement date requirements of SFAS No. 158 had no impact.
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
     The Company assumed the Applied Biosystems' qualified pension plans, non qualified supplemental benefit plans, and postretirement benefit plans in conjunction with its acquisition of Applied Biosystems. The pension plans cover a portion of former Applied Biosystems' worldwide employees. Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment. However, the level of benefits and terms of vesting may vary among plans. The Company determines the required funding of the pension plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The Company also sponsors nonqualified supplemental benefit plans for select U.S. employees in addition to our principal pension plan. These supplemental plans are unfunded, however, Applied Biosystems prior to its acquisition had established a rabbi trust, through which the assets may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $58.7 million at December 31, 2008. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits. The domestic pension plan covers U.S. employees hired by Applied Biosystems prior to July 1, 1999. The accrual of future service benefits for all participants was frozen as of June 30, 2004. Benefits earned under the plan will be paid out under existing plan provisions. The postretirement benefit plan is unfunded and provides healthcare and life insurance benefits to domestic employees who retire under the domestic pension plan provisions and satisfy certain service and age requirements. In addition, employees hired prior to January 1, 1993 also receive subsidized retirement medical benefits. Generally, medical coverage pays a stated percentage of most medical expenses, and in some cases, participants pay a co-payment. Benefits are reduced for any deductible and for payments made by Medicare or other group coverage. The Company shares the cost of providing these benefits with retirees. The Company provides some postemployment benefits to eligible former Applied Biosystems employees, which generally include severance and outplacement costs, disability, and medical-related costs paid after employment but before retirement. The Company also provided a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which certain executives elected to defer compensation to a future period. The Company holds assets and liabilities which correspond to this plan in the amount of $24.9 million, located on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in current assets and long term liabilities.
     The Company also has a qualified pension plan ("defined benefit") for substantially all United States employees that were employed by Life Technologies prior to its acquisition by the Company in September 2000. The Company's policy is to deposit with an independent trustee amounts as are necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and any other applicable Federal laws and regulations. The U.S. pension plan provides benefits that are generally based upon a percentage of the employee's highest average compensation in any consecutive five-year period in the ten years before retirement. The Company froze this plan effective December 31, 2001. The Company will continue to administer the plan but benefits will no longer accrue.
     The Company also sponsors nonqualified supplementary retirement plans for certain former senior management of Life Technologies and Dexter, which were acquired in 2000. The Company has life insurance policies on the lives of participants designed to provide sufficient funds to recover all costs of the plans. In addition to the above plans, the Company sponsors nonqualified executive supplemental plans for certain former Dexter and Life Technologies senior managers that provide for a target benefit based upon a percentage of the average annual compensation during the highest five consecutive years of the last ten years before retirement, which benefit is then offset by other work related benefits payable to the participant. The Life Technologies plan is unfunded and funding for the Dexter plan is provided for through a VEBA Trust.
     The Company also administers the Dexter Postretirement Health and Benefit Program (the Dexter PRMB Plan), which provides benefits to certain participants who are not employees of the Company but were employees of Dexter prior to the sale of their businesses and prior to the Company's merger with Dexter.
 
     In 2005, the Company assumed one defined benefit plan (the Norway Plan) in conjunction with its acquisition of Dynal. The Norway Plan is currently active and open to new employees and provides benefits based upon the employee's highest average base compensation and number of years of service.
     The retirement benefits for most employees of non-U.S. operations are generally provided by government sponsored or insured programs and, in certain countries, by defined benefit plans. The Company has defined benefit plans for United Kingdom (U.K.) and Japan employees. The Company's policy with respect to its U.K. pension plan is to fund amounts as are necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits under the pension plan in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. The U.K. pension plan provides benefits based upon the employee's highest average base compensation over three consecutive years. The Japan pension plan provides benefits based upon the employee's average base compensation and is an unfunded plan. The U.K. pension plan was frozen as of September 30, 2007 to additional members and for accruing additional benefits for current participants of the plan.
     The funded status of the Company's pension and postretirement plans and amounts recognized at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:
 
     Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the period ended December 31, 2008, amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 and the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be amortized into fiscal year 2009, net periodic benefit expense are as follows:
     The weighted average assumptions used in accounting for the pension and postretirement plans for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:
     The Company uses an actuarial measurement date of January 1 of the current year to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measurements as of December 31 of the current year. The discount rate is the estimated rate at which the obligation for pension benefits could effectively be settled. The expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings that the Company estimates will be generated on the assets of the plans. The rate of compensation increase reflects the Company's best estimate of the future compensation levels of the individual employees covered by the plans. When calculating pension expense for 2008, the Company assumed that its plan's assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 3.00%-8.00%.
     Our asset investment goal is to achieve a long-term targeted rate of return consistent with the ongoing nature of the plan's liabilities. The plan's assets are invested so that the total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns meet the plan's long-term total return goal. Plan assets are invested using active and passive investment strategies and diversification that employ multiple investment funds. Funds cover a range of investment styles and approaches and are combined in a way to achieve a target allocation across capitalization and style biases (equities) and interest rate expectations (fixed income). The Company's management monitors performance against benchmark indices. The plan's investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. The assets of the plan are periodically rebalanced to remain within the desired target allocations. The expected rate of return on assets is determined based on the historical results of the portfolio, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns, and takes into consideration of external actuarial advice.
 
     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement benefits plans. A one-percentage point change in weighted average assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
     The weighted average assumed health care cost trend rates on the postretirement benefits plans at December 31, 2008 are as follows:
     The components of net periodic pension cost for the Company's pension and postretirement plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
     Our postretirement benefits are frozen plans. Net periodic pension income (cost) for this plan is included in general and administrative expense, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
     The projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets for the pension and postretirement plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31 were as follows:
     The weighted average asset allocations at December 31, by asset category, for the Company's domestic funded plans are as follows:
 
     The weighted average asset allocations at December 31, by asset category, for the Company's foreign funded plans are as follows:
     We do not generally fund pension plans when our contributions would not be tax deductible. Based on the level of our contributions to the Applied Biosystems U.S. pension plan, which was assumed in conjunction with its merger of Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Pension Plan and Dexter PRMB Plan during previous fiscal years, we do not expect to have to fund these pension plans in fiscal year 2009 in order to meet minimum statutory funding requirements.
 
     Our estimated future employer contributions, gross expected benefit payments, and gross amount of annual Medicare Part D federal subsidy expected to be received at December 31, 2008, are as follows:
     Expected benefit payments for the domestic plan in 2009 are larger than traditionally expected due to the merger of Applied Biosystems and Life Technologies. Certain terminated employees are expected to take a lump sum benefit as permitted by the plan provision.
10. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS
     The Company has ten stock option plans:the 1995, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004 Life Technologies Corporation stock option plans, the 1996 and 1998 NOVEX Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plans, and the Life Technologies 1995 and 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plans. During 2004, the Company's stockholders approved the 2004 Invitrogen Corporation Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), which replaced the Company's 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2002 stock option plans (collectively, the Prior Plans). Upon approval of the 2004 Plan, all Prior Plans were frozen and a total of 14.4 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for granting of new awards under the 2004 Plan. The total shares reserved for issuance under the 2004 Plan includes all options and other awards that the Company has granted that are still outstanding under the Prior Plans as of December 31, 2008. Pursuant to an employment agreement entered in May 2003, the Company granted an option to purchase 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock to its Chief Executive Officer, which was granted outside any of the Company's option plans discussed above.
     The Company's 2004 Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards and deferred stock awards of up to 30.0 million shares of stock. Shares of the Company's common stock granted under the 2004 Plan in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights are counted against the 2004 Plan share reserve on a one-for-one basis. Shares of the Company's common stock granted under the 2004 Plan as an award other than as an option or as a stock appreciation right are counted against the 2004 Plan share reserve on a 1.6 shares for each share of common stock basis. Stock option awards are granted to eligible employees and directors at an exercise price equal to no less than the fair market value of such stock on the date of grant, generally vest over a period of time ranging up to four years, are exercisable in whole or in installments and expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are granted to eligible employees and directors and represent rights to receive shares of common stock at a future date. In addition, the Company has a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("purchase rights") whereby eligible employees may elect to withhold up to 15% of their compensation to purchase shares of the Company's stock on a quarterly basis at a discounted price equal to 85% of the lower of the employee's offering price or the closing price of the stock on the date of purchase.
     Upon the merger with Applied Biosystems, the Company assumed five stock plans: the Applied Biosystems Group Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the Applied Biosystems Group Amended and Restated 1993 Director Stock Purchase and Deferred Compensation Plan, the Perkin-Elmer Corporation 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Life Technologies Corporation Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1999 Plan), and the Life Technologies Incorporated Amended and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the Assumed Plans). Upon assumption of the 1999 Plan, all prior plans were frozen and a total of 6.6 million shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for the granting of new awards under the 1999 Plan. The total shares reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan includes all options and other awards that the Company has granted that are still outstanding under the Prior Plans as of December 31, 2008.
 
     The Company's 1999 Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards and deferred stock awards of up to 37 million shares of stock to legacy Applied Biosystems employees and new employees of the Company. Shares of the Company's common stock granted under the 1999 Plan in any form are counted against the 1999 Plan share reserve on a one-for-one basis. Stock option awards are granted to eligible employees and directors at an exercise price equal to no less than the fair market value of such stock on the date of grant, generally vest over a period of time ranging up to four years, are exercisable in whole or in installments and expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are granted to eligible employees and directors and represent rights to receive shares of common stock at a future date. In addition, the Company has a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("purchase rights") whereby eligible legacy Applied Biosystems employees may elect to withhold up to 10% of their compensation to purchase shares of the Company's stock on a quarterly basis at a discounted price equal to 85% of the lower of the employee's offering price or the closing price of the stock on the date of purchase.
     The Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to value share-based employee stock option and purchase right awards, which was also used for the Company's proforma disclosures required under SFAS 123 prior to adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. The determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards using an option-pricing model requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of share-based compensation cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Among these include the expected term of options, estimated forfeitures, expected volatility of the Company's stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate.
     The expected term of share-based awards represents the weighted-average period the awards are expected to remain outstanding and is an input in the Black-Scholes model. In determining the expected term of options, the Company considered various factors including the vesting period of options granted, employees' historical exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior, expected volatility of the Company's stock and aggregation by homogeneous employee groups. The Company used a combination of the historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of market-traded options of the Company's stock with terms of up to approximately two years to estimate the expected volatility assumption input to the Black-Scholes model in accordance with SFAS 123R and the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107). The Company's decision to use a combination of historical and implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options of its stock and its assessment that such a combination was more representative of future expected stock price trends. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's expectation of future dividend payouts. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends, although Applied Biosystems historically declared and paid dividends prior to the merger. The Company currently anticipates that it will retain all of its future earnings for use in the development and expansion of its business, for debt repayment and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon its results of operations, financial condition, tax laws and other factors as the Board of Directors, in its discretion, deems relevant. In addition, the Company's ability to pay dividends in the future may be restricted by the financial covenants of its credit agreement that was executed in November 2008 in connection with the merger with Applied Biosystems. The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share-based awards.
Stock Options and Purchase Rights
     The underlying assumptions used to value employee stock options and purchase rights granted during the year ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:
     SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. Excess tax benefits of $18.5 million and $5.4 million were reported as net financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
     The Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods on a cumulative basis in the period the estimated forfeiture rate changes. The Company considered its historical experience of pre-vesting option forfeitures as the basis to arrive at its estimated pre-vesting option forfeiture rate of 6.1% per year at the year ended December 31, 2008. All option awards, including those with graded vesting, were valued as a single award with a single average expected term and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. At December 31, 2008, there was $68.0 million remaining in unrecognized compensation cost related to employee stock options (including stock options assumed in business combinations), which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. No compensation cost was capitalized in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2008 as the amounts involved are not material.
     Total share-based compensation expense for employee stock options and purchase rights for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is composed of the following:

Restricted Stock Units
     Restricted stock units represent a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant's award agreement. There is no exercise price and no monetary payment is required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award. Instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the participant's services to the Company. Restricted stock units vest over one to five years. Compensation cost for these awards is based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. There were no pre-vesting forfeitures estimated for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $12.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in share-based compensation cost related to these restricted stock unit awards. At December 31, 2008, there was $28.3 million remaining in unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. The estimated amortization expense of the deferred compensation on the restricted stock unit awards as of December 31, 2008 is $14.2 million, $7.0 million, and $4.4 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
     The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $28.64. A summary of restricted stock units activity for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented below:

     During 2004 and 2003, the Company issued 40,000 and 310,000 shares of restricted stock awards, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $36.38 for issuances during 2004 and $24.67 for issuances during 2003 to certain executive officers and key employees. The awards generally vest over four years. Compensation cost for these restricted stock awards is based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Pre-vesting forfeitures were zero percent. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $0.1 million in share-based compensation cost related to these restricted stock awards.

Deferred Stock Awards
     The 2004 Plan also provides that certain participants who are executives or members of a select group of highly compensated employees may elect to receive, in lieu of payment in cash or stock of all or any portion of such participant's cash and/or stock compensation, an award of deferred stock units. A participant electing to receive deferred stock units will be granted automatically, on the effective date of such deferral election, deferred stock unit award for a number of stock units equal to the amount of the deferred compensation divided by an amount equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. During the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, no participants participated in the program and therefore no shares were deferred under this plan. The 2004 Plan is authorized to grant up to 200,000 shares of common stock as deferred stock units.

13. RESTRUCTURING COSTS
     On November 21, 2008, we completed the acquisition of Applied Biosystems Inc. (AB) pursuant to a merger agreement that was entered into on June 11, 2008. Our merger created a new company that combines both businesses into a global leader in biotechnology reagents and instrument systems dedicated to improving the human condition. In connection with the AB acquisition and also the desire to achieve synergies associated with economies of scale, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to provide one-time personnel benefit costs, specifically severance and relocation costs to those employees whose employment positions would be eliminated and relocated, respectively. The restructuring plan also includes closure of certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in the Company's operations. Since the AB acquisition was completed during the latter part of fourth quarter 2008, the Company currently continues to evaluate the restructuring plan and estimated one-time termination benefits and site closure costs, which the Company expects will be incurred through 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, $3.5 million of one-time personnel benefit costs were included in business consolidation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company records these restructuring costs in accordance with SFAS 146, .
