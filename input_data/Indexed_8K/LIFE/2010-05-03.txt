Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
2010 Incentive Compensation Plan
     On April 29, 2010, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Annual Meeting) of Life Technologies Corporation (Company), the Company's stockholders approved and adopted the 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (Plan). The Company's Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (Committee) previously approved the Plan on February 24, 2010.
     The Plan is a performance-based compensation bonus plan designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 162(m)), such that the Company will be able to fully deduct bonus payments made pursuant to the Plan as a compensation expense. Section 162(m) and related guidance generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of $1 million paid during a single year to its chief executive officer and its three other most highly compensated named executive officers, excluding its chief financial officer. Certain compensation is exempt from this Section 162(m) deduction limit if it qualifies as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m).
     To qualify as "performance-based" compensation, the payment of any bonus under the Plan must be made contingent upon the achievement of one or more of the performance goals identified in the Plan. The performance goals may be applied to either the Company as a whole or to a business unit, affiliate, region or business segment, or any combination thereof, and may be measured either on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to a previous period's results or to a designated comparison group.
     The Committee will administer the Company's annual cash incentive program under the Plan. Only the Company's named executive officers and other officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be eligible to participate in the Plan.
     A copy of the Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the Plan set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement.
Deferred Compensation Plan
     On April 28, 2010, the Committee approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP). The DCP combines into a single non-qualified plan the deferred compensation plans previously sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company's named executive officers, along with certain other highly compensated employees and the non-employee members of the Company's board of directors, are eligible to participate in the DCP.
     Employees who participate in the DCP will be permitted to defer up to 75% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of their annual cash bonus and sales commission. The Company will provide matching contributions on a participant's behalf if the participant's 401(k) matching contributions are required to be limited pursuant to applicable qualified retirement plan contribution limitations. In addition, the Company will provide participants with a supplemental matching contribution of up to 25% of the annual target cash bonus and sales commission (payable in 2011) the participant defers and allocates into the Company's common stock, subject to a three-year cliff vesting period. The supplemental match amount and associated vesting is subject to annual approval by the Committee. Each non-employee director can participate in the DCP by deferring any cash retainer fee or other cash fee paid by the Company as consideration for the non-employee director's service to the Company. The non-employee directors are not entitled to participate in the supplemental matching contribution offered by the Company to its participating employees.
     A copy of the DCP is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the DCP set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement.

Adjustments
.
          (a) .
Adjustments to Conversion Price
               (i) . Upon the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, the subdivision of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, or the combination of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall, simultaneously with the happening of such dividend, subdivision or split be adjusted by multiplying the then effective Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section A.7(a)(i) shall be given effect, upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof.
Stock Dividends, Subdivisions and Combinations
               (ii) . In the event the Corporation shall at any time, or from time to time, issue, sell or exchange any shares of Common Stock including shares held in the Corporation's treasury but excluding up to an aggregate 3,735,479 shares of Common Stock (as appropriately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends and the like) issued to officers, Directors, employees of, or consultants, advisors, independent contractors to the Corporation or the Corporation's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "") (collectively, "") pursuant to the Corporation's 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan or ESOP (collectively, the "") or upon the exercise of options or other rights issued to such Eligible Employees pursuant to the Plans (collectively, the ""), for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance, sale or exchange of such shares, then, and thereafter successively upon each such issuance, sale or exchange, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance, sale or exchange of such shares shall forthwith be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction: (A) the numerator of which shall be (X) the number of shares of Common Stock of all classes outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, options, warrants, rights or convertible securities), plus (Y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the net aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price (prior to adjustment), and
Sale of Common Stock

Excluded Shares
 
(B) the denominator of which shall be (X) the number of shares of Common Stock of all classes outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such additional shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, options, warrants, rights or convertible securities), plus (Y) the number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued.
                    (iii) . In the event the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time, issue options, warrants or rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock, or issue any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock (other than any options or warrants for Excluded Shares), for a consideration per share (determined by dividing the Net Aggregate Consideration (as determined below) by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would be issued if all such options, warrants, rights or convertible securities were exercised or converted to the fullest extent permitted by their terms) less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such options or rights or convertible or exchangeable securities, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such options, warrants or rights or securities shall be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction:
Sale of Options, Rights or Convertible Securities
                              (A) the numerator of which shall be (X) the number of shares of Common Stock of all classes outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such options, rights or convertible securities (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, options, warrants, rights or convertible securities), plus (Y) the number of shares of Common Stock which the total amount of consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance of such options, warrants, rights or convertible securities plus the minimum amount set forth in the terms of such security as payable to the Corporation upon the exercise or conversion thereof (the "") would purchase at the Conversion Price prior to adjustment, and
Net Aggregate Consideration
                              (B) the denominator of which shall be (X) the number of shares of Common Stock of all classes outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such options, warrants, rights or convertible securities (excluding treasury shares but including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, options, warrants, rights or convertible securities), plus (Y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would be issued if all such options, warrants, rights or convertible securities were exercised or converted.
                    (iv) . If the consideration per share provided for in any options or rights to subscribe for shares of Common Stock or any securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares of Common Stock changes at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such change shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such options or convertible securities provided for such changed consideration per share (determined as provided in Section A.7(a)(iii) hereof), at the time initially granted, issued or sold; , that such adjustment of the Conversion Price will be made only as and to the extent that the Conversion Price effective upon such adjustment remains less than or equal to the Conversion Price that would be in effect if such options, rights or securities had not been issued. No adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made under this Section A.7(a) upon the issuance of any additional shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights or pursuant to the exercise of any conversion or exchange rights in any convertible securities if an adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such warrants, options or other rights. Any adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be disregarded if, as, and when the rights to acquire shares of Common Stock upon exercise or conversion of the warrants, options, rights or convertible securities which gave rise to such adjustment expire or are canceled without having been exercised, so that the Conversion Price effective immediately upon such cancellation or expiration shall be equal to the Conversion Price in effect at the time of the issuance of the expired or canceled warrants, options, rights or convertible securities, with such additional adjustments as would have been made to that Conversion Price had the expired or canceled warrants, options, rights or convertible securities not been issued.
Expiration or Change in Price
provided
          (b) . As set forth below, upon a QPO in which the Price to Public (as defined in Section A.6(b)) is 1.25 times or greater but less than two (2) times the Conversion Price, for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in connection therewith, the Conversion Value shall be adjusted prior
Adjustment to Conversion Value upon Certain QPOs
 
to the closing and conversion by multiplying the Conversion Value then in effect by the applicable Conversion Value Multiplier set forth below. The Conversion Value Multiplier is determined according to (i) the closing date of such offering and (ii) the Price to Public expressed as a multiple of the Conversion Price. The Conversion Value Multiplier with respect to any multiple of the Conversion Price between any of the data points in any column below shall be determined by linear interpolation (for example, given a QPO on July 1, 1997 with a Price to Public equal to 1.625 times the Conversion Price, the Conversion Value Multiplier would be 1.0355).
          (c) . In the event the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event lawful and adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the number of securities of the Corporation which they would have received had their Convertible Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock and Redeemable Preferred Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this Section A.7 as applied to such distributed securities.
Other Adjustments
     If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this Section A.7), then and in each such event the holder of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
          (d) . Unless such transaction is a QET (in which case Section A.6(b) shall apply and this subsection shall not apply), if at any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section A.7) or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's properties and assets to any other person, then, as a part of and as a condition to the effectiveness of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made so that the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the successor Corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale. In any such case, appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock after the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section A.7 (including without limitation provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, with respect to any shares of stock, securities or assets to be deliverable thereafter upon the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock.

Redeemable Base Liquidation Amount
Measurement Event
 
the Redeemable Base Liquidation Amount per share would be $5.6743. By way of further example, if on December 18, 1998 the Price to Public or per share value of such consideration were 3.5 times the Conversion Price, the Redeemable Base Liquidation Amount per share would be $0.00, and each holder would be entitled to receive the amounts due under clauses (ii) through (iv) of Section B.4(a) above.
          (c) . For purposes of determining the Redeemable Base Liquidation Amount, any securities or other consideration to be delivered to the holders of the Common Stock upon completion of any Measurement Event shall be valued as follows:
Valuation of Distribution Securities
               (i) If traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or system over the 30-day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing;
               (ii) If traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30-day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing; and
               (iii) If there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Corporation and the holders of not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent in voting power of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, provided that if the Corporation and the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent in voting power of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are unable to reach agreement, then by independent appraisal by an investment banker hired and paid by the Corporation, but reasonably acceptable to the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent in voting power of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.

At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
     Section 1.4 .

Quorum
     If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date, or time.
 
     If a notice of any adjourned special meeting of stockholders is sent to all stockholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that it will be held with those present constituting a quorum, then except as otherwise required by law, those present at such adjourned meeting shall constitute a quorum, and all matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting.
     Section 1.5 . Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the Chairman, if there is such an officer, or if not, the Presiding Director of the Corporation, or in the absence of all of the above, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting.

Organization
     Section 1.6 . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
     Section 1.7 . At an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) if, and only if, the notice of an annual meeting or special meeting specifically provides for and describes the business to be brought before the meeting by stockholders, properly brought before the annual meeting or special meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal offices of the Corporation no later than the date on which stockholder proposals to be included in the stockholder proxy must be received by the Corporation under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules promulgated thereunder. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual or special meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual or special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual or special meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) any direct or indirect pecuniary or economic interest in any capital stock or other security of the Corporation of such person, including, without limitation, any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge, or profit-sharing arrangement. Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the contrary (i) no business shall be conducted at an annual or special meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.7, (ii) other than with respect to stockholder nominations for the election of Directors, the procedures in clause (c) of this Section 1.7 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to properly submit business (other than business properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's proxy statement) before an annual or special meeting of stockholders; it being understood that a
Notice of Stockholder Business
 
stockholder seeking to nominate directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders must comply with notice and information requirements of Section 2.11, and (iii) the procedures in Section 2.11 (including the notice and information requirements therein) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to submit nominations for the election of Directors before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. The chairman of an annual or special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.7, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
     Section 1.8 . At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting.
Proxies and Voting
     Each stockholder shall have one vote for every share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in his name on the record date for the meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.
     All voting, except where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a stockholder entitled to vote or by his proxy, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting. Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by an inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting.
     Except as otherwise required by applicable law or by the Certificate of this Corporation or these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders for the election of one or more Directors at which a quorum is present, each Director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the Director, provided that if, as of a date that is ten (10) days in advance of the date on which the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the SEC (regardless of whether thereafter revised or supplemented), the number of nominees for Director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the Stockholders entitled to vote at the election. For purposes of this Section 1.8, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a Director exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that Director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. If a Director then serving on the Board of Directors does not receive the required majority, the Director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board. Within ninety (90) days after the date of the certification of the election results, the Governance and Nominating Committee or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken, and the Board will act on such committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it. In addition, and except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of this Corporation or these Bylaws, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast.
 
     Section 1.9 . A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in his name, shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.
Stock List
     The stock list shall also be kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
     Section 1.10 . The stockholders of the Corporation may not act by written consent and may act only at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders.
No Stockholder Action by Written Consent
     Section 2.1 . The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption). The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, who shall vote for such directors as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. The directors shall be divided into three (3) classes, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders held after the closing of the first sale of the Corporation's common stock pursuant to a firmly underwritten registered public offering (the "IPO"); the term of office of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders held after the IPO; the term of office of the third class to expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders held after the IPO; and thereafter for each such term to expire at each third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after such election. All directors shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until their respective successors are elected, except in the case of the death, resignation or removal of any director. Directors need not be stockholders.

Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships
 
expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
     Section 2.3 . Subject to the limitations stated in the Certificate of Incorporation, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, but only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of its then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office before the expiration of the applicable term of office only with cause. Vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from such removal may be filled by (i) a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or (ii) the stockholders at a special meeting of the stockholders properly called for that purpose, by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at such special meeting.

However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if timely notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2.11. To be timely, a stockholder nomination for a director to be elected at an annual meeting shall be received at the Corporation's principal executive offices not less than 120 calendar days in advance of the first year anniversary of the date that the Corporation's proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, or in the event of a nomination for director to be elected at a special meeting, notice by the stockholders to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (d) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; and (f) any direct or indirect pecuniary or economic interest in any capital stock or other security of the Corporation of such nominating stockholders, including, without limitation, any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge, or profit-sharing arrangement.

Any committee so designated may exercise the power and authority of the Board of Directors to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock or to adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation if the resolution which designates the committee or a supplemental resolution of the Board of Directors shall so provide. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any committee and any alternate member in his place, the member or members of the committee present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may by unanimous vote appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of the absent or disqualified member.

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
          The Applera Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Applera Plan") was originally adopted to provide specified benefits to a select group of management and/or highly-compensated employees of Applera Corporation ("Applera"), a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Applera Plan was later used to provide benefits to eligible management and/or highly-compensated employees of Applied Biosystems, Inc. ("ABI"), Applera's successor.
          Applera, and later ABI, also sponsored the Excess Benefit Plan of Applera Corporation (the "Excess Plan"). The Excess Plan was designed to provide additional retirement benefits to those employees whose retirement benefits under the Employee Pension Plan of Applied Biosystems, Inc., and/or the Employee 401(k) Savings Plan of Applied Biosystems, Inc., were limited due to the application of Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code.
          ABI merged with Invitrogen Corporation effective November 21, 2008. As of the date of the merger, Invitrogen Corporation sponsored a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the "Invitrogen Plan") benefiting a select group of management and/or highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors of Invitrogen Corporation.
          Following ABI's merger with Invitrogen Corporation, the name of the combined company was changed to "Life Technologies Corporation." Life Technologies Corporation amended and restated the Invitrogen Plan, the Applera Plan, and the defined contribution component of the Excess Plan, combining them into a single non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The combined plan, as so amended and restated, is called the Life Technologies Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is effective April 28, 2010.
          The combined Plan has four major components: (1) a "Core Deferred Compensation" component under which a select group of management and/or highly-compensated employees of Life Technologies Corporation may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, all or a portion of their annual salary, commission, and/or cash bonus; (2) a "Non-employee Director" component under which non-employee directors of Life Technologies Corporation may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their directors' cash retainer; (3) an "Excess Benefit" component which provides additional benefits to eligible Life Technologies Corporation employees whose benefits are limited due to the application of various limits imposed under the Internal Revenue Code; and (4) a "Supplemental Contribution" component under which eligible employees of Life Technologies Corporation can receive a discretionary contribution and/or matching contribution.
 
          The Plan is intended to reward such persons for their material contributions to the continued growth, development, and future business success of Life Technologies Corporation, and to provide them with incentives to put forth maximum effort for the long-term success of Life Technologies Corporation. The Plan shall be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.
          It is intended that all amounts deferred and vested by employees of Applera and/or ABI under either the Applera Plan or the Excess Plan prior to January 1, 2005, and any amounts credited as earnings thereon, shall be considered grandfathered from the application of Code Section 409A. Nothing in this Plan is intended to affect such amounts, which shall be governed by the terms of those plans as in effect on October 3, 2004.
 
     For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, the following phrases or terms shall have the following indicated meanings:

Each subsequent Annual Installment Payment shall be determined by calculating the value of the Deferral Account as of the anniversary of such date, and multiplying this amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of Annual Installment Payments selected by the Participant, minus the number of any Annual Installment Payments previously paid. By way of example, if the Participant elects Annual Installment Payments to be made over a ten year period, the first installment shall be 1/10 of the value of the Deferral Account on the applicable date.

Once the Award has become vested in accordance with this Section 8, the Award shall be settled on the consummation of the Change in Control in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the discretion to revise, without the consent of any Director, the meaning of the terms "Change in Control" and "Ownership Event" should the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or any regulations or other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service require, or make such changes, necessary or desirable to preserve the desired tax impacts to the Director and the Company underlying this Award.
