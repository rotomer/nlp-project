Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Life Technologies Corporation (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2011 (the "Original Filing"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Companys decision regarding how frequently it will conduct stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. No other changes have been made to the Original Filing. At the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Companys stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal regarding the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers  or future "say-on-pay" votes. As previously reported by the Company, a majority of the votes cast on the frequency proposal were cast in favor of holding an annual "say-on-pay" vote. In light of the voting results with respect to the frequency proposal, at a meeting held on July 24, 2011, the Companys Compensation & Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors decided that the Company will hold an advisory "say-on-pay" vote every year in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders until the next vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of executives. The Company is required to hold votes on frequency every six years.
