Item 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On February 7, 2012, Life Technologies Corporation, or the Company, issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for the period ended December 31, 2011. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Certain of the information set forth in the press release may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. We regularly have reported non-GAAP results for net income and earnings per share in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP results exclude merger related non-cash items and other costs. Additionally, the discussion surrounding sales performance related to these results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations period over period and acquisitions to measure core sales growth. This growth rate is referred to as organic growth.
Our financial results under GAAP include substantial non-cash charges and tax benefits related to acquired businesses. Our non-GAAP calculations of net income and earnings per share are limited because they do not reflect the entirety of our business costs. However, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a useful supplemental disclosure to investors as it provides an indication of the profitability and cash flows of the combined businesses apart from the costs related to acquisitions. Also included in the non-GAAP results are certain business transformation cash expenses which management does not believe are indicative of profitability for ongoing business activities. Management believes that this information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.
In addition to the non-cash charges above, we exclude from our non-GAAP results the following costs:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management views these costs as not indicative of the profitability or cash flows of its ongoing or future operations and excludes these costs as a supplemental disclosure to assist investors in evaluating and assessing our past and future operational performance. Management uses non-GAAP earnings as a primary indicator in planning and forecasting for future periods, including trending the Company's core performance period over period. Management uses these non-GAAP earnings to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and uses these results to measure performance at a corporate level. The Company primarily uses non-GAAP earnings for evaluating management's performance for compensation purposes.
Item 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
See the information set forth under Item 2.02 above and attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Life Technologies Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Results
 
 
 
 
 Life Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: LIFE) today announced results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011 and provided financial guidance for 2012.
CARLSBAD, CA, February 7, 2012
"I am pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011, even as we faced a number of challenges, including macroeconomic headwinds and constrained spending by some of our customers," said Gregory T. Lucier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Life Technologies. "Overcoming these obstacles, we delivered top line growth, reduced our operating costs to meet the slower growth environment and expanded our operating margins an impressive 110 basis points, all of which we leveraged to deliver bottom line growth for the twelfth consecutive year. We finished the year with strong free cash flow of $710 million."
"Looking ahead to 2012, we expect growth in our game-changing Ion Torrent franchise, expansion in end markets and geographies and continued operational efficiencies to drive organic revenue growth of 2 to 4 percent over 2011 results and adjusted non-GAAP EPS in a range of $3.90 to $4.05."
Life Technologies reported results compared to quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.

Changes in Reporting
The company plans to modify its reporting to better align with changes it has made in its internal organization. These changes have no impact on results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company as a whole.
The company currently reports revenues for three divisions: Molecular Biology Systems, Genetic Systems and Cell Systems. Starting in the first quarter of 2012, the company will report revenues for the following three business groups: Research Consumables, Genetic Analysis and Applied Sciences. These changes will be finalized during and effective for the first quarter of 2012 and the company will provide revised financial data reflecting these changes prior to reporting its first quarter results in April 2012.
Fiscal Year 2012 Outlook
Subject to the risk factors detailed in the Safe Harbor Statement section of this release, the company provided its expectations for fiscal year 2012 financial performance. The company expects organic revenue growth of 2 to 4 percent over 2011 revenues of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $3.90 to $4.05. The guidance includes a revenue headwind of approximately $26 million, or 0.7 percent, and a benefit to non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.02 from currency. The currency impact consists of a negative effect from changes in currency exchange rates based on December 2011 month end rates, partially offset by a benefit from not having the hedge losses that occurred in 2011. The company will provide further detail on its business outlook during the webcast today.
