Item 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On November 1, 2012, Life Technologies Corporation, or the Company, issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for the period ended September 30, 2012. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Certain of the information set forth in the press release may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. We regularly have reported non-GAAP results for net income and earnings per share in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP results exclude merger related non-cash items and other costs. Additionally, the discussion surrounding sales performance related to these results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations period over period and acquisitions to measure core sales growth. This growth rate is referred to as organic growth.
Our financial results under GAAP include substantial non-cash charges and tax benefits related to acquired businesses. Our non-GAAP calculations of net income and earnings per share are limited because they do not reflect the entirety of our business costs. However, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a useful supplemental disclosure to investors as it provides an indication of the profitability and cash flows of the combined businesses apart from the costs related to acquisitions. Also included in the non-GAAP results are certain business transformation cash expenses which management does not believe are indicative of profitability for ongoing business activities. Management believes that this information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.
In addition to the non-cash charges above, we exclude from our non-GAAP results the following costs:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management views these costs as not indicative of the profitability or cash flows of its ongoing or future operations and excludes these costs as a supplemental disclosure to assist investors in evaluating and assessing our past and future operational performance. Management uses non-GAAP earnings as a primary indicator in planning and forecasting for future periods, including trending the Company's core performance period over period. Management uses these non-GAAP earnings to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and uses these results to measure performance at a corporate level. The Company primarily uses non-GAAP earnings for evaluating management's performance for compensation purposes.

 Life Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: LIFE) today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2012. Revenue for the third quarter was $911 million, a decrease of 1.9 percent over the $929 million reported for the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth for the quarter was 1.4 percent compared to the same period of the prior year.
CARLSBAD, CA, November 1, 2012
 
(See note regarding subsequent litigation below.)
"Our third quarter performance came in stronger than our expectations driven by a significant increase in Ion Torrent platform sales, as well as increased sales in our research consumables and forensics businesses," said Gregory T. Lucier, chairman and chief executive officer of Life Technologies. "During the quarter, we made solid progress in expanding our operations and footprint in high growth and emerging markets, including entering into strategic partnerships for companion diagnostics, building the foundation for our Medical Sciences business and acquiring distributors in China and Chile. We achieved important milestones with several highly anticipated launches including the Ion Proton System, a platform whose speed, ease of use and affordability will democratize genome sequencing, and our Pervenio Lung RS test service, the first of its kind molecular test to identify early-stage lung cancer patients who are at high risk of reoccurrence following surgery."
"We continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing an additional $208 million worth of shares in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $535 million. Based on our performance year-to-date and end market assumptions, we are tightening the full year guidance range by increasing the bottom end by $0.05 and are now expecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.00."
Life Technologies reported current quarter results compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Results are non-GAAP unless indicated otherwise. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the tables of today's press release.

Business Group Highlights
 
 
 
 
Fiscal Year 2012 Outlook
Subject to the risk factors detailed in the Safe Harbor Statement section of this release, the company is updating its guidance. The company's updated 2012 guidance is for organic revenue growth of approximately 2 percent over 2011 revenues of $3.7 billion. Additionally, the company is tightening the previously provided range by increasing the bottom by $0.05 and is now expecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.00. The company will provide further detail on its business outlook during the webcast today.
The Ion Proton System is for Research Use Only and not intended for use in diagnostic procedures.
 
Subsequent Litigation
Earlier today, the company received an unfavorable verdict in its litigation with Enzo Biochem relating to CE sequencing products during the period 1998-2004. The relevant patent expired in 2004, so the verdict does not have any effect on the Company's CE business going forward. The jury ruled that Life Technologies had infringed Enzo Biochem's intellectual property relating to reagent sales and gave a verdict in the amount of $48.5 million in favor of Enzo Biochem. The company strongly disagrees with the verdict and intends to vigorously challenge it in the trial court and on appeal.
 
The company will record a GAAP only expense of $48.5 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. This will result in a reduction of GAAP net income of approximately $31.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share.
 
The current financial tables in this press release do not reflect this expense, but the company intends to update the financial tables in an amended Form 8-K to be filed in the next two business days.

The company will discuss its financial and business results as well as its business outlook on its webcast at 4:30 PM ET today. This webcast will contain forward-looking information.

For actual results, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the company's financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, as well as other material financial and statistical information to be discussed on the webcast will be posted at the company's investor relations website at .
