The price of both the Firm Stock and any Option Stock shall be $54.90 per share. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any of the Stock to be delivered on any Delivery Date (as hereinafter defined), as the case may be, except upon payment for all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date as provided herein. 3. Offering of Stock by the Underwriters. Upon authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Firm Stock, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Stock for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus. 4.

On the First Delivery Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates representing the Firm Stock to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Company of the purchase price by wire transfer in immediately available funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Stock shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the First Delivery Date.

Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of shares of Option Stock as to which the option is being exercised, the names in which the shares of Option Stock are to be registered, the denominations in which the shares of Option Stock are to be issued and the date and time, as determined by the Representatives, when the shares of Option Stock are to be delivered; provided, however, that this date and time shall not be earlier than the First Delivery Date nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised. The date and time the shares of Option Stock are delivered are sometimes referred to as a "Second Delivery Date" and the First Delivery Date and any Second Delivery Date are sometimes each referred to as a "Delivery Date."

On such Second Delivery Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered the certificates representing the Option Stock to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Company of the purchase price by wire transfer in immediately available funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Option Stock shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in the aforesaid written notice. For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of the certificates for the Option Stock, the Company shall make the certificates representing the Option Stock available for inspection by the Representatives in New York, New York, not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to such Second Delivery Date. 5.

any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e); provided further, that the indemnification contained in this paragraph (a) with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any officers or employees of any Underwriter or of any person controlling such Underwriter) on account of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of Stock by such Underwriter to any person if the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and the Underwriter sold Stock to that person without sending or giving at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company has previously furnished sufficient copies thereof to the Underwriter on a timely basis to permit such sending or giving. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company or the Significant Subsidiary may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the officers and employees of the Company, each of the directors of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director of the Company, officer of the Company or controlling person of the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) in any Blue Sky Application or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director of the Company, officer of the Company or controlling person of the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director of the Company, officer of the Company or controlling person of the Company in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director of the Company, officer of the Company, employee of the Company, or controlling person of the Company. 19
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party in writing, (ii) such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel, it is advisable for such indemnified party to employ separate counsel or (iii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by Lehman Brothers Inc., if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of any Underwriters or any of their respective officers, employees or controlling persons, or by the Company, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of the Company or any of the Company's directors, officers, employees or controlling persons. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the 20
indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Significant Subsidiary on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Significant Subsidiary, on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Significant Subsidiary, on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company or the Significant Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the shares of the Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Significant Subsidiary or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the net proceeds deemed to be received by the Company shall be deemed to be also for the benefit of the Significant Subsidiary and information supplied by the Company shall also be deemed to have been supplied by the Significant Subsidiary. The Company, the Significant Subsidiary and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter 21
has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Significant Subsidiary acknowledge that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Stock by the Underwriters in the fourth, seventh, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth and nineteenth paragraphs and the second and third sentences of the sixteenth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 9. Defaulting Underwriters. If, on either Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Stock which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Stock on such Delivery Date if the total number of shares of the Stock which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of shares of the Stock which it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to such Delivery Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Company to sell, the Option Stock) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company and the Significant Subsidiary will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Firm Stock which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. 22
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Stock of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement. 10. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(j), 7(k) or 7(l), shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement. 11. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If (a) the Company shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company and the Significant Subsidiary will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock, and upon demand the Company and the Significant Subsidiary shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representative(s). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company and the Significant Subsidiary shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses. 12. Notices, etc. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., 790 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Department (Fax: (212) 526-3633), with a copy, in the case of any notice pursuant to Section 8(c), to the Director of Litigation, Office of the General Counsel, Lehman Brothers Inc., 790 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019; and (b) if to the Company or to the Significant Subsidiary, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Christopher C. Cambria (Fax: 212-805-5494); provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its acceptance telex to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to any other party hereto by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. The Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Underwriters by Lehman Brothers Inc. on behalf of the Representatives. 23
13. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Company, the Significant Subsidiary and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the officers and employees of the Underwriters and the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (B) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 8(b) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, officers of the Company who have signed the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 13, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. 14. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, the Significant Subsidiary and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Stock and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. 15. Definition of the Terms "Business Day" and "Subsidiary." For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "business day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close and (b) "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rules and Regulations. 16.

EXHIBIT A FORM OF SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT OPINION June 28, 2002 LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC. MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED SG COWEN SECURITIES CORPORATION and the other Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement referred to below c/o Lehman Brothers Inc. 790 Seventh Avenue New York, New York 10019 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Shares"), of the Company from the Company pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated June 24, 2002 among the Company, L-3 Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("L-3 Communications"), Lehman Brothers Inc. and the other several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement. We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-84826) filed by the Company, L-3 Communications and the additional registrants named therein under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement") and the Company's prospectus dated June 20, 2002, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated June 24, 2002 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company and L-3 Communications for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, as amended by the Company's and L-3 Communications' Annual Report on a Form 10-K/A-1 filed on June 19, 2002, the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company and L-3 Communications filed on March 22, 2002, April 24, 2002 and June 19, 2002 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the Company and L-3 Communications for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 (each, an "Exchange Act Document" and collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We have also examined a specimen
certificate representing the Common Stock of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals or duplicates or certified or conformed copies of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and L-3 Communications, and have made such other and further investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth. Our opinion that the Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act is based on oral advice from the staff of the Commission. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. Each of the Company, L-3 Communications and the Company's subsidiaries listed on Schedule A hereto (each, a "Subsidiary" and collectively, the "Subsidiaries") (other than L-3 Communications Integrated Systems LP (the "LP")) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all corporate power and authority necessary to conduct its respective businesses as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 2. The LP has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all limited partnership power and authority necessary to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 3. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; all of the Shares to be sold by the Company have been duly authorized and, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; all of the issued shares of capital stock of L-3 Communications and each Subsidiary (other than the LP) have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable (except for directors' qualifying shares); and, based solely on an examination of each such Subsidiary's stock ledger and minute books, all such shares are held of record by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. 4. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and the Prospectus was filed on June 25, 2002 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act, and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission. 5. The statements made in the Prospectus under the captions "Risks Related to Our Common Stock - Delaware law and the charter documents of L-3 Holdings may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of its shares to
decline," and "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as they describe charter documents, contracts, statutes, rules and regulations and other legal matters, constitute an accurate summary thereof in all material respects. 6. The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects. 7. To our knowledge, there are no contracts or documents of a character required by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described or filed as required by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 8. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and L-3 Communications. 9. The issue and sale of the Shares being delivered by the Company and the compliance by the Company and L-3 Communications, as applicable, with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach, or result in a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement nor will such actions violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, L-3 Communications or the Subsidiaries (other than the LP) or, in the case of the LP, the Limited Partnership Agreement dated February 22, 2002, between L-3 Communications AIS GP Corporation and L-3 Communications Investments, Inc., or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act by any court or governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act is required for the issue and sale of the Shares by the Company, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriters. The opinions set forth in this paragraph are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations, which, in our experience, are normally applicable to securities underwriting transactions.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents), we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and with counsel to the Underwriters. We did not prepare the Exchange Act Documents. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents) and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of June 24, 2002, complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that we express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we have no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission on such effective date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) as of June 24, 2002 and as of the date hereof, contained as of such date or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted as of such date or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents. We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States, Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
