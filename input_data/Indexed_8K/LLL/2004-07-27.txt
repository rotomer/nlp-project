For the 2004 second quarter, sales increased by 36.9% to $1,680.0 million from sales of $1,226.9 million for the 2003 second quarter. The increase in sales from acquired businesses was $279.3 million. Consolidated organic(2) sales growth was 14.2%, or $173.8 million. Organic sales growth for the company's defense businesses was 13.7%, or $149.2 million, driven by continued strong demand for secure communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems and products, aircraft modernization and maintenance, training and government services, training devices, guidance, navigation and imaging products and naval power equipment and services. Organic sales for the company's commercial and other non-military businesses increased by 17.4%, or $24.6 million, primarily due to increased volume for commercial aviation products and maintenance of security systems. Consolidated operating income for the 2004 second quarter increased by 38.3% to $178.1 million from $128.8 million for the 2003 second quarter. Consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) increased to 10.6% for the 2004 second quarter, compared to 10.5% for the 2003 second quarter. The changes in operating margin are explained in the company's segment results discussed below. For the 2004 second quarter, interest and other (income) expense includes a $1.7 million loss for certain equity investments, and a $1.2 million loss related to an increase in the carrying value of the embedded derivatives related to L-3's $420 million of 4% Senior Subordinated Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES). Net income for the 2004 second quarter increased by 65.0% to $88.1 million, compared to net income of $53.4 million for the 2003 second quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 52.8% to $0.81, compared to $0.53 for the 2003 second quarter. Net income for the 2003 second quarter includes an after-tax charge of $7.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the early retirement of the company's $180 million of 8 1/2% senior subordinated notes. Excluding this debt retirement charge, diluted EPS would have increased by 35.0% for the 2004 second quarter compared to the 2003 second quarter. - ------------------- Notes: (1) See discussions and calculations of free cash flow on the financial tables attached to this press release.

"L-3 had strong performance across its business segments, particularly in ISR, secure communications, training devices and services, aircraft modernization, and guidance, navigation and imaging products." YEAR TO DATE RESULTS For the 2004 first half, sales increased by 38.2% to $3,201.6 million from sales of $2,315.9 million for the 2003 first half.

Organic sales for the company's commercial and other non-military businesses increased by 0.9%, or $2.5 million, primarily due to increased volume for commercial aviation products partially offset by lower sales for Explosives Detection Systems (EDS). Operating income for the 2004 first half increased by 38.8% to $329.7 million from $237.6 million for the 2003 first half. Operating margin was unchanged at 10.3%. For the 2004 first half, interest and other (income) expense includes a $2.6 million loss for certain equity investments and a $1.9 million loss related to an increase in the carrying value of the embedded derivatives related to L-3's $420 million of 4% Senior Subordinated Convertible Contingent Debt Securities (CODES).

Net income for the 2003 first half includes the after-tax debt retirement charge of $7.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, as discussed above. Excluding this debt retirement charge, diluted EPS would have increased by 33.6% for the 2004 first half compared to the 2003 first half. For the 2004 first half, funded orders increased by 34.3% to $3,515.0 million, compared to funded orders of $2,617.7 million for the 2003 first half. Net cash from operating activities for the 2004 first half increased by 17.1% to $244.0 million from $208.3 million for the 2003 first half.

Total debt declined by $311.7 million to $2,145.6 million at June 30, 2004, compared to $2,457.3 million at December 31, 2003. Shareholders' equity increased by $513.9 million to $3,088.4 million at June 30, 2004, from $2,574.5 million at December 31, 2003. Total debt as a percentage of book capitalization (total debt plus minority interest plus shareholders' equity) decreased to 40.4% at June 30, 2004, compared to 48.1% at December 31, 2003. Available borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities were $669.9 million at June 30, 2004. The decline in debt is primarily due to the conversion of $298.2 million of convertible notes into 7.3 million shares of L-3 Communications Holdings common stock in January of 2004, which also increased shareholder's equity by $292.3 million. -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS PAGE 3 SEGMENT RESULTS SECURE COMMUNICATIONS & ISR Secure Communications & ISR (SC&ISR) 2004 second quarter sales increased by 17.3% to $413.6 million from $352.6 million for the 2003 second quarter.

Operating income was $35.3 million for the 2004 second quarter, compared to $30.5 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating margin decreased to 11.3% from 11.7%, due to higher sales from cost-reimbursable type and time and material type contracts, which generally have lower profit margins than fixed-priced type contracts.

L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS PAGE 5 aircraft at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and an increase in volume for commercial aviation products. Organic sales growth does not include the portion of the AMCOM contract sales of $22.4 million attributable to Vertex Aerospace's pre-acquisition ownership interest of 40% in the contract, which are included in sales from acquired businesses above. AP&AM generated operating income of $54.2 million for the 2004 second quarter, compared with $33.7 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating margin decreased to 9.8% from 13.3%, primarily because of the anticipated lower operating margins from the Vertex Aerospace acquired business and the AMCOM contract, as well as higher cost-reimbursable contract type sales for aircraft modifications. Orders for the AP&AM segment were $536.6 million during the 2004 second quarter and included: o Additional funding for Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOF-SA) to provide full service logistics support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). o An award to provide risk reduction tasks associated with the communications system and interior configuration for the Presidential VXX Phase I helicopter. o Selection to design and manufacture a state-of-the-art Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. o A U.S. Army award for L-3's all-purpose recorder to be fitted for the entire U.S. Army helicopter inventory. o An award from Cirrus Design for Altitude Indicators, Sky Watch(R) Collision Warning Systems and Stormscope(R) Weather Mapping Systems. o A U.S. Navy award for the P-3C Enhanced Special Structural Inspection (ESSI) program to conduct Enhanced Special Structural Inspections (ESSIs) on 16 P-3 aircraft. o Multiple orders for Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) to be used on various regional aircraft.

L-3 will be providing in service support and major subsystems. For the first half of 2004, sales for AP&AM increased by 164.4% to $1,073.8 million from $406.1 million for the first half of 2003. The increase in sales from acquired businesses was $526.1 million. The acquired businesses include Avionics Systems, Vertex Aerospace, Military Aviation Services and Flight Systems Engineering, which were acquired during 2003, and Avysis, Inc., which was acquired in 2004. Organic sales growth was $141.6 million, or 34.9%, driven by higher sales for aircraft modernization and maintenance, including the AMCOM contract, and commercial aviation products. Most of the organic sales growth for commercial aviation products occurred during the 2004 second quarter. AP&AM generated operating income of $104.0 million for the 2004 first half, compared to $54.5 million for the 2003 first half. Operating margin decreased to 9.7% from 13.4%, primarily because of trends similar to those for the 2004 second quarter. SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS Specialized Products 2004 second quarter sales increased by 11.3% to $401.7 million from $360.8 million in the 2003 second quarter.

L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS PAGE 6 million. The acquired businesses include Klein Associates, which was acquired in September 2003, and Bay Metals and Brashear LP, which were both acquired during the 2004 second quarter. These increases were partially offset by volume declines for ruggedized computers and displays. Sales for undersea warfare products also declined due to contracts nearing completion and reliability problems on a product that are being remediated, which reduced production and sales. Operating income was $31.8 million for the 2004 second quarter, compared with $22.1 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating margin increased to 7.9% from 6.1%, primarily because of cost reductions and volume increases for navigation and imaging products, naval power equipment and services and microwave components, which were partially offset by an increase in the estimated costs to remediate the product reliability problems on an undersea dipping sonar product. Orders for the Specialized Products segment were $525.9 million during the 2004 second quarter and included: o An award from the Polish Air Force to provide F-16 Block 50 aircraft flight simulators and egress procedure trainers. o An award from Egypt for the company's Low Frequency Active Towed Sonar (LFATS). This contract launches a new product in an emerging market; namely Low Frequency Variable Depth Sonars for shipboard applications. o Several orders for L-3's Cargo screening business, including orders from Dutch and Polish customs for the company's high-energy mobile screening trucks. o An award from the Royal Australian Air Force to provide F-18 simulators to support pilot training and mission readiness. o An initial subcontract to develop and support the U.S. Army's Flight School XXI program. o An order from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) for L-3's MX-15 multi-sensor electro-optic and infrared (EO/IR) systems for installation on the U.S. Navy P-3C maritime patrol aircraft. o An award to design, fabricate and install a series of sophisticated technology upgrades to the 37-meter-diameter Radio Telescope. o An order from the U.S. Navy for an Intrusion Detection Radar System as well as an Automated Identification System (AIS) Base Station with an installed Harbor Guard(R) Real Time Situational Awareness workstation. o A follow-on award from the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for the Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR). o Continued support for subsystems in efforts for the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). o Several international orders for L-3's Automated screening systems and an order from the New York City Police Department for an X-ray screening system. o A contract from the National Defense Organization (NDO) for radio transceivers configurable to many applications, such as a man-pack, vehicular or base station systems. o An order to provide deployable Satellite Communications Systems, Subsystems and Components, including maintenance support, to the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR). -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS PAGE 7 o An award for the TriTrak Strike Projectile SAASM GPS receivers for the Hunter UAV. For the first half of 2004, sales for Specialized Products increased by 2.7% to $747.9 million, from $728.2 million for the first half of 2003. The increase in sales from acquired businesses was $10.0 million. The acquired businesses include Klein Associates, which was acquired in 2003, and Bay Metals and Brashear LP, which were acquired in 2004. Organic sales growth was $9.7 million, or 1.3%, driven by the trends affecting the 2004 second quarter, as well as lower volume for EDS systems during the 2004 first quarter. Specialized Products generated operating income of $55.5 million for the 2004 first half, compared to $47.8 million for the 2003 first half. Operating margin increased to 7.4% from 6.6%, primarily because of the trends affecting the 2004 second quarter, as well as the lower volumes for sales of EDS systems. GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES RESULTS For the 2004 second quarter, sales from the company's government businesses increased by 39.5% to $1,501.8 million from $1,076.6 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating income from the company's government businesses for the 2004 second quarter increased by 28.5% to $158.1 million from $123.0 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating margin declined to 10.5% from 11.4%, primarily due to lower margins from the Vertex acquired business and the AMCOM contract. Sales from the company's commercial businesses increased by 18.6% to $178.2 million, compared to $150.3 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating income from the company's commercial businesses for the 2004 second quarter increased by 245% to $20.0 million, compared to operating income of $5.8 million for the 2003 second quarter. Operating margin increased to 11.2% from 3.9%, primarily due to lower losses at the company's PrimeWave Communications business, cost improvements for microwave components and higher sales volume for commercial aviation products. For the first half of 2004, sales from the company's government businesses increased by 42.1% to $2,876.0 million from $2,023.4 million for the 2003 first half. Operating income from the company's government businesses for the 2004 first half increased by 32.2% to $300.1 million from $227.0 million for the 2003 first half.

For the first half of 2004, sales from the company's commercial businesses increased by 11.3% to $325.6 million from $292.5 million for the 2003 first half. Operating income from the company's commercial businesses for the 2004 first half increased by 179.2% to $29.6 million from $10.6 million for the 2003 first half. Operating margin increased to 9.1% from 3.6%, primarily due to trends similar to those affecting the 2004 second quarter. OUTLOOK "We expect continued good performance for the second half of 2004," said Mr. Lanza, "as the DoD continues to invest in the military transformation of its operations, focusing on ISR, security, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), training, precision weapons and aircraft modernization. The U.S. Congress continues to be very supportive of defense spending for fiscal 2005, despite the pressures of an upcoming general election and the challenges of significant troop deployment in the Middle East." "The top line DoD budget growth for fiscal 2006 could vary between 1% and 6%," continued Mr. Lanza, "depending on the outcome of the presidential election and on which party leads Congress. In any event, both parties have strong defense appropriations leadership, which will not allow the DoD budget to be a bill player for other budget and spending priorities. In addition, there is widespread support for funding to advance military transformation initiatives, and we expect L-3 to continue to grow organically because we believe that L-3's products are key to the enhancement and upgrade of existing and new military platforms and systems, and can also provide added value to the diversity of systems." -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS PAGE 8 Mr. Lanza also said that the DoD is continuing to make progress in ensuring more opportunities for the vendor base to bid their products into large defense platform contracts managed by the prime system contractors as large-scale integrators. In homeland security, L-3 has become a major presence in providing a number of products for a variety of applications. "We are beginning to see more planning and focused spending from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and state and local governments to secure their citizens and their infrastructure," said Mr. Lanza, "and we expect this to increase for the next several years." He also said that L-3 has developed a broad array of products for homeland security, including integrated airport, cargo, maritime, port and border security solutions, as well as crisis management systems and vehicles for command and control and bioterrorism. Mr. Lanza also noted that the acquisition pipeline continues to be strong. "Although there are fewer large acquisition candidates available, there continue to be many companies with $50 million to $300 million of annual revenues that would be a very attractive fit for L-3. We will continue to rely on an acquisition strategy that has proven successful for us over a long period of time to supplement L-3's organic growth. Our strategy is to acquire synergistic companies with products that are number-one or number-two in their markets and to continue to demonstrate financial prudence in what we pay for these companies and ensure that they are accretive within one year. We do not use size as a metric to decide which companies are a good fit for L-3. We are looking for good companies that are undervalued and can expand our product and service offerings to L-3's customer base, rather than stand alone additions to L-3's portfolio of businesses." "As we look to the second half of 2004, we expect continued good growth and that we will exceed our target of 20% growth - 10% through internal growth and 10% from acquisitions," said Mr. Lanza. "Our internal growth is driven by a solid defense budget and the fact that our offerings are well positioned to take advantage of continuing transformation of the U.S. Military. There continues to be a good number of affordable acquisition candidates that can add to our ISR, secure communications, government services, training and simulation, aircraft modernization and our expanding catalog of specialized products, as well as products and systems for homeland defense." The company expects sales for 2004 compared to 2003 to grow in excess of 30% to more than $6.6 billion, including organic sales growth of between 10% and 12% and increases from acquired businesses. Operating income is expected to grow by more than 26%, resulting in 2004 diluted earnings per share of approximately $3.40. The company expects to generate free cash flow of between $430 million and $440 million for 2004, which is comprised of net cash from operating activities of between $535 million and $545 million, less approximately $105 million of capital expenditures, net of dispositions of property, plant and equipment.

L-3 COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC. UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) ---------------- (a) In 2004, we consolidated the explosives detection systems (EDS) business into L-3 Security and Detection Systems, the IMC business into L-3 Government Services, Inc., the EMP business into our ESSCO business and the Apcom business into our Communication System-East business. As a result of these business realignments, certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period sales and operating income amounts to conform them to the current period presentation. Specifically, $13.6 million of sales and $3.3 million of operating income was reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" to "Commercial, primarily products" primarily for the EDS business, and $9.1 million of sales and $0.6 million of operating income was reclassified from "Commercial, primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government," primarily for the IMC business for the three months ended June 30, 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, $43.2 million of sales and $5.7 million of operating income was reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" to "Commercial, primarily products," primarily for the EDS business and $20.7 million of sales and $0.8 million of operating income was reclassified from "Commercial primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government," primarily for the IMC business. (b) In order to calculate diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003, the after-tax interest expense savings on the assumed conversion of Convertible Notes must be added to net income and then divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The amount to add to net income is $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and $5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (IN MILLIONS) --------------- (c) In 2004, we consolidated the IMC business into L-3 Government Services, Inc. As a result of this realignment, $9.1 million of sales and $1.3 million of operating income was reclassified from the Specialized Products segment to the Training, Simulation & Government Services segment for the three months ended June 30, 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, $19.1 million of sales and $2.7 million of operating income was reclassified from the Specialized Products segment to the Training, Simulation & Government Services segment. (d) The company discloses free cash flow because the company believes that, subject to the limitations discussed below, it is one indicator of the cash flow generated that is available for investing and financing activities. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment). Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying for interest on borrowings, income taxes, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, but before repaying principal amount of outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on common stock and investing cash to acquire businesses and making other strategic investments. Thus, key assumptions underlying free cash flow are that the company will be able to refinance its existing debt when it matures with new debt, and that the company will be able to supplementally finance any new acquisitions it makes by raising new debt or equity capital. Because of these assumptions, free cash flow is not a measure that can be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.
