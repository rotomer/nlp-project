(NYSE: LLL)announced today that it has initiated a full redemption of all of itsoutstanding 4.00% Senior Subordinated Convertible Contingent Debt Securities(CODES) due 2011 (the "CODES"). On or prior to the close of business onThursday, October 21, 2004, holders of the CODES may elect to convert theirCODES into common stock of L-3 at a conversion price of $53.8125 per share bysurrendering the CODES in accordance with the indenture to The Bank of New York,as conversion agent, at 101 Barclay Street, 7 East, New York, New York 10286,Attention: Kin Lau, Reorganization Unit. As of October 4, 2004, the lastreported sales price of L-3's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was$67.89. Holders of the CODES who convert their CODES into common stock of L-3Communications will receive accrued and unpaid interest on their CODES(including contingent interest) to October 25, 2004.To the extent that holders of the CODES do not convert their CODES into commonstock of L-3 Communications, such CODES will be redeemed for cash on October 25,2004 at a redemption price of 102.000% of the principal amount thereof, plusaccrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest) to October 25, 2004.On or before October 25, 2004, such CODES should be presented to The Bank of NewYork, as paying agent for the redemption, at the address set forth in the Noticeof Redemption, dated October 5, 2004, to be sent that day to all registeredholders.Interest on the CODES (including contingent interest) will cease to accrue onand after October 25, 2004 and the only remaining right of holders of the CODESis to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender to the payingagent, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest) up to,but not including, October 25, 2004.                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS INITIATES FULL REDEMPTION OF CONVERTIBLE SENIOR SUBORDINATEDNOTES AND DESCRIBES THE NON-CASH IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING RULE (EITF 04-8) ONL-3's DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE                                         PAGE 2This press release shall not constitute a notice of redemption of the CODES.As a result of the redemption of the CODES or the conversion of the CODES intoL-3 common stock, L-3's annual cash interest expense payments will be reduced byapproximately $17 million, which is expected to prospectively increase L-3'sannual net cash from operating activities by about $11 million (after relatedincome taxes).Additionally, on September 30, 2004 the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) reached a consensus on EITF IssueNo. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings PerShare, which addresses when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debtinstruments should be included in diluted earnings per share (EPS). EITF 04-8requires that contingently convertible debt instruments are to be included inthe computation of diluted EPS regardless of whether the market price triggerhas been met. EITF 04-8 also requires that prior period diluted EPS amountspresented for comparative purposes be restated. Upon FASB ratification, EITF04-8 will become effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004.As previously disclosed by the Company, the impact of applying EITF 04-8 toL-3's CODES will result in non-cash reductions to L-3's previously reporteddiluted EPS, as follows: for the full year 2002 by $0.03 from $1.93 to $1.90;for the full-year 2003 by $0.09 from $2.71 to $2.62; and, for the 2004 firsthalf by $0.05 from $1.47 to $1.42. These reductions to L-3's diluted EPS areequal to those that would have resulted assuming a conversion of the CODES intoL-3 common stock, which L-3 has previously disclosed in its quarterly reports onForm 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company's previousoutlook for the full-year 2004 estimated diluted EPS of approximately $3.40 willbe reduced by $0.13 to $3.27, including a reduction to diluted EPS for the 2004third quarter of $0.04. The Company expects that the reductions to diluted EPSafter 2004 will be partially offset by future improvements in operatingperformance.Headquartered in New York City, L-3 Communications is a leading provider ofIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, securecommunications systems, aircraft modernization, training and government servicesand is a merchant supplier of a broad array of high technology products. Itscustomers include the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security,selected U.S. Government intelligence agencies and aerospace prime contractors.SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth inthis news release are forward-looking statements.
