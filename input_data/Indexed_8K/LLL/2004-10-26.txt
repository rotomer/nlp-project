Organic sales growthwas $48.0 million, or 4.3%, driven by the trends similar to those affecting the2004 third quarter (discussed above), as well as by volume declines for underseawarfare products and ruggedized computers and displays. Specialized Productsgenerated operating income of $87.7 million for the 2004 nine-month period,compared to $91.7 million for the 2003 nine-month period. Operating margindecreased to 7.4% from 8.3%, primarily because of trends similar to thoseaffecting the 2004 third quarter (discussed above), and lower volume forruggedized computers and displays, which were partially offset by higher volumefor imaging products.GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES RESULTSFor the 2004 third quarter, sales from the company's government businessesincreased by 43.1% to $1,586.1 million from $1,108.6 million for the 2003 thirdquarter.

The 2004 third quarter operating income also included a $4.5million gain related to the settlement of a claim.Sales from the company's commercial businesses increased by 27.0% to $198.1million, compared to $156.0 million for the 2003 third quarter. Operating incomefrom the company's commercial businesses for the 2004 third quarter increased by44.3% to $15.3 million, compared to operating income of $10.6 million for the2003 third quarter.

EITF 04-8 requires thatcontingently convertible debt instruments are to be included in the computationof diluted EPS regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. Forcomparative purposes, the adoption of EITF 04-8 will also require thatpreviously reported diluted EPS amounts be restated to include the provisions ofEITF 04-8. EITF 04-8 is expected to be effective for reporting periods endingafter December 15, 2004.                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS                   PAGE 8L-3 will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-8 during the 2004 fourth quarter. Theimpact of applying EITF 04-8 to L-3's CODES will result in non-cash reductionsto L-3's reported diluted EPS, as follows: for the 2004 third quarter by $0.04from $0.93 to $0.89; for the 2003 third quarter by $0.03 from $0.74 to $0.71;for the 2004 nine-month period by $0.09 from $2.41 to $2.32; and for the 2003nine-month period by $0.05 from $1.77 to $1.72. As discussed above,substantially all of L-3's CODES were converted into L-3 common stock as ofOctober 21, 2004, following L-3's notice of redemption for the CODES which wasmade on October 5, 2004.OUTLOOK"We expect our fourth quarter performance to continue to be strong, helping usto achieve excellent full year results," said Mr. Lanza. "We also see continuedgrowth in 2005 and beyond. The DoD is in the initial stages of itstransformation strategy, which we believe will continue for the rest of thedecade and will impact the size and capabilities of the U.S. military, includingthe way in which they engage and defeat the enemy, the platforms they use andhow they use them. We believe that the DoD will continue to prioritize fundingfor this transformation, upgrading ISR systems, communications, sensors,precision weaponry, and putting more focus on UAVs and modernizing existingassets to fight more efficiently and effectively."Mr. Lanza also noted that there has been much debate about increases in defensespending over the next few years, considering the impact of the upcomingelections and other government budget demands. "We believe that defense spendinghas the continued support of Congress and will remain a priority in anyadministration," said Mr. Lanza. He noted that L-3 should continue to benefiteven if the overall DoD budget were to remain flat, because it is expected thatthe procurement and research and development segments of the budget willcontinue to grow and L-3's systems, products and services are in higher growthareas of defense spending."We anticipate that there will be changes in spending priorities for the armedforces as they review their 2006 defense budget proposals," continued Mr. Lanza."The military will have to balance its requirements with the affordability ofnew platforms on the drawing board today and some may have to be sacrificedand/or stretched. The DoD also will have to determine how transformation playsinto today's threat environment, the impact that spiral modernization will haveand how our forces can be optimized to succeed in urban warfare, along with anumber of other unstable world conditions.""Both Congress and the DoD have been concerned about the viability of certainsegments of the defense industry," said Mr. Lanza, "and we believe they havetaken an important step in ensuring that small and medium-sized vendor companiescan continue to bring innovation to defense platforms." Historically, one of thekey drivers of innovation and cost-effective products in the defense industryhas been the technological contributions of the vendor base. However, over theyears, the number of vendor companies has been shrinking due to industryconsolidation and vertical integration. As a result, Michael Wynn, DoD deputyundersecretary (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) has issued a policy toensure that the military receives the benefits of competition. This policyrequires that large scale integrators allow vendors to compete on platform "makeor buy" decisions.In addition, the DoD is looking for ways to leverage its existing and newplatforms and assets to assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inprotecting the U.S. There are many areas of homeland security where the DoD canplay a significant mission role. For instance, the government is studying how itcould combine its vast air, land and sea sensors and communicationsinfrastructure and battle-management systems to create a layered, interoperabledefense for the U.S.                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS                   PAGE 9On the issue of homeland security spending, Mr. Lanza reiterated his view thatprotecting U.S. citizens and infrastructure will continue to be a priority inany administration. "L-3 believes it has the broadest base of homeland securityproducts and services in the industry," said Mr. Lanza. "Major business areasfor L-3 are aviation security, military force protection, mobile command,control and communications, communications for the U.S. Coast Guard Deepwaterprogram and U.S. customs P-3 support. Other large potential business areasinclude port, cargo and transportation security." L-3 also manufactures a numberof other homeland security products, including biometric access and vehiclebarrier products, airborne stabilized imaging systems, border security, crisismanagement systems and secure communications.Regarding the acquisition climate, Mr. Lanza commented that "there are still alarge number of companies in the defense arena, primarily in the range of $50million to $300 million in revenue that are available for acquisition. We arelooking for companies that add greater depth, capability and synergies to ourexisting business segments. As we have in the past, we will select thosecompanies with products that are number-one or number-two in their nichemarkets, exercise great discipline in what we will pay for these assets andensure they are accretive within a year."2004 Financial Outlook. The company expects sales for 2004 compared to 2003 togrow in excess of 34% to about $6.8 billion, including organic sales growth ofbetween 13% and 14%, with the remaining growth coming from acquired businesses.Operating income is expected to grow by about 28%, resulting in 2004 dilutedearnings per share of approximately $3.33. The company's diluted EPS estimate ofapproximately $3.33 for the full year 2004 includes (i) a non-cash reduction of$0.13 caused by the new accounting rule (EITF 04-8) concerning the effect ofcontingently convertible debt on diluted EPS, which is expected to becomeeffective for L-3 in the 2004 fourth quarter, and the conversion of the CODESfrom debt into L-3 common stock, which occurred in October 2004 (discussedabove), and (ii) a $0.03 increase for the restoration of the R&E tax credit andthe related reduction to the effective income tax rate for the full year 2004from 36.5% to 36.0% (discussed above). The company expects to generate free cashflow of about $460 million for 2004, which is comprised of net cash fromoperating activities of approximately $545 million, less approximately $85million of capital expenditures, net of dispositions of property, plant andequipment.CONFERENCE CALLIn conjunction with this release, L-3 Communications will host a conferencecall, which will be broadcast live over the Internet.

As a result of    these business realignments, certain reclassifications have been made to the    prior period sales and operating income amounts to conform them to the    current period presentation. Specifically, for the three months ended    September 30, 2003, $6.9 million of sales and $6.1 million of operating    income was reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" to    "Commercial, primarily products" primarily for the EDS business, and $4.3    million of sales and $0.4 million of operating loss was reclassified from    "Commercial, primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government,"    primarily for the IMC business. For the nine months ended September 30,    2003, $50.1 million of sales and $11.8 million of operating income was    reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" to "Commercial,    primarily products," primarily for the EDS business and $25.0 million of    sales and $0.4 million of operating income was reclassified from "Commercial    primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government," primarily for    the IMC business.(b) In order to calculate diluted earnings per share for the three and nine    months ended September 30, 2003, the after-tax interest expense savings on    the assumed conversion of Convertible Notes must be added to net income and    then divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The    amount to add to net income is $2.6 million for the three months ended    September 30, 2003 and $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,    2003.                                     -more-

As a result of this realignment, $4.3 million of sales and $0.5 million of    operating loss was reclassified from the Specialized Products segment to the    Training, Simulation & Government Services segment for the three months    ended September 30, 2003. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003,    $23.4 million of sales and $2.2 million of operating income was reclassified    from the Specialized Products segment to the Training, Simulation &    Government Services segment.(d) The company discloses free cash flow because the company believes that,    subject to the limitations discussed below, it is one indicator of the cash    flow generated that is available for investing activities, other than    capital expenditures and financing activities. Free cash flow is defined as    net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital    expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and    equipment). Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying for    interest on borrowings, income taxes, capital expenditures and changes in    working capital, but before repaying principal amount of outstanding debt,    paying cash dividends on common stock and investing cash to acquire    businesses and making other strategic investments. Thus, key assumptions    underlying free cash flow are that the company will be able to refinance its    existing debt when it matures with new debt, and that the company will be    able to finance any new business acquisitions it makes by raising new debt    or equity capital. Because of these assumptions, free cash flow is not a    measure that can be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow    available for discretionary expenditures.
