SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATIONITEM 2.02.        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.On February 1, 2005 L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (L-3) issued a pressrelease setting forth L-3's 2004 fourth quarter financial results. A copy ofthis press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.This press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1, and shall not bedeemed filed for purposes of the Exchange Act.SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTSSECTION 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.The following updates the Company's previous disclosure with respect to theKalitta Air litigation solely to reflect that the trial with respect to suchlitigation began on January 18, 2005.L-3 Integrated Systems and its predecessors have been involved in a litigationwith Kalitta Air arising from a contract to convert Boeing 747 aircraft frompassenger configuration to cargo freighters. The lawsuit was brought in thenorthern district of California on January 31, 1997. The aircraft were modifiedusing Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) issued in 1988 by the FederalAviation Administration (FAA) to Hayes International, Inc. (Hayes/Pemco) as asubcontractor to GATX/Airlog Company (GATX). Between 1988 and 1990, Hayes/Pemcomodified five aircraft as a subcontractor to GATX using the STCs. Between 1990and 1994, Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. (CTAS), a predecessor toL-3 Integrated Systems, performed as a subcontractor to GATX and modified anadditional five aircraft using the STCs. Two of the aircraft modified by CTASwere owned by American International Airways, the predecessor to Kalitta Air. In1996, the FAA determined that the engineering data provided by Hayes/Pemcosupporting the STCs was inadequate and issued an Airworthiness Directive thateffectively grounded the ten modified aircraft. The Kalitta Air aircraft havenot been in revenue service since that date. The matter was tried in January2001 against GATX and CTAS with the jury finding fault on the part of GATX butrendering a unanimous defense verdict in favor of CTAS. Certain co-defendantshad settled prior to trial. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reversedand remanded the trial court's summary judgment rulings in favor of CTASregarding a negligence claim by Kalitta Air, which asserts that CTAS as anexpert in aircraft modification should have known that the STCs were deficient,and excluding certain evidence at trial. Based on this ruling, a retrial hasbeen scheduled for September 2004. In preparation for retrial, Kalitta Air hassubmitted to us an expert report on damages that calculated Kalitta Air'sdamages at either $232 million or $602 million, depending on different factualassumptions. We have retained experts whose reports indicate that, even in theevent of an adverse jury finding on the liability issues at trial, Kalitta Airhas already recovered amounts from the other parties to the initial suit thatmore than fully compensated Kalitta Air for any damages it incurred. CTAS'insurance carrier has accepted defense of the matter with a reservation of itsright to dispute its obligations under the applicable insurance policy in theevent of an adverse jury finding. The trial began on January 18, 2005, and isexpected to go to the jury for deliberation in mid-to late February 2005. Wehave meritorious defenses and intend to continue to vigorously defend thismatter. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is possible that anadverse jury decision could be rendered, which could have a material adverseeffect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cashflows.SECTION 9 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITSITEM 9.01         FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

The increasein sales from acquired businesses was $967.6 million, or 94.9%. The acquiredbusinesses include Avionics Systems, Vertex Aerospace, MAS and Flight SystemsEngineering, which were acquired during 2003, and AVISYS, Inc., which wasacquired in 2004. Organic sales growth was $302.6 million, or 29.7%, driven byhigher sales for aircraft modernization, operations and maintenance, includingthe AMCOM contract, and commercial and military aviation products. Operatingincome was $249.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to$147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating margin decreasedto 10.9% from 14.5%, primarily because of trends similar to those affecting the2004 fourth quarter (previously discussed).SPECIALIZED PRODUCTSSpecialized Products 2004 fourth quarter sales increased by 3.2% to $497.3million from $481.9 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. Organic sales declinedby $4.8 million, or 1.0%, due to lower sales volume for explosives detectionsystems (EDS), caused primarily by a later-than-expected receipt of an orderfrom the U.S. Transportation and Security Administration, and a reduction insales for navigation products due to contracts nearing completion. Thesedecreases to sales were partially offset by higher volume for training devices,naval power equipment services and maintenance of security systems. The increasein sales from acquired businesses was $20.2 million, or 4.2%. The acquiredbusinesses include Bay Metals, Brashear, LP and Infrared Products, which wereacquired during 2004. Operating income was $44.1 million for the 2004 fourthquarter, compared with $53.1 million for the 2003 fourth quarter. Operatingmargin decreased to 8.9% from 11.0%, primarily because of changes in productsales mix for security products, including lower sales of higher margin EDSsystems and telemetry products. These decreases to operating margin werepartially offset by higher margins on undersea warfare products, primarily dueto higher volume for spares and lower product reliability costs.Orders for the Specialized Products segment were $471.4 million during the 2004fourth quarter and included:o    An award for the development phase of the Swiss F/A-18 Flight Simulator     Upgrade program.o    Funding to provide study and system evaluation services associated with the     development of the modernization of the Global Positioning System (GPS).o    An award from the Royal Omani Air Force to provide a full F-16 Aircrew     Training System.o    Sole source follow-on funding for Strategic Weapons System (SWS), providing     support of shipboard and down range tracking equipment for Test and     Training activities associated with the Trident Submarine fleet.o    An award from the U.S. Army for the production of the M762A1 and M767A1     electronic timed artillery fuzes.                                     -more-

The increasein sales from acquired businesses was $47.4 million, or 3.0%. The acquiredbusinesses include Klein Associates, which was acquired in 2003, and Bay Metals,Brashear, LP and Infrared Products, which were acquired in 2004. Organic salesgrowth was $43.3 million, or 2.7%, driven by increased sales of trainingdevices, imaging products, naval power equipment and services, partially offsetby volume declines for EDS, undersea warfare products and ruggedized computersand displays. Operating income was $131.8 million for the year ended December31, 2004, compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.Operating margin decreased to 7.8% from 9.1%, primarily because of changes inproduct sales mix for security products, including lower sales of higher marginEDS systems and telemetry products, and a $4.5 million gain related to thesettlement of a claim recorded in September, 2003. These decreases werepartially offset by operating income for the naval power equipment businesses in2004, as compared to operating losses in 2003.GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES RESULTSFor the 2004 fourth quarter, sales from the company's government businessesincreased by 33.4% to $1,693.6 million from $1,269.8 million for the 2003 fourthquarter.

"We expect that for 2005 U.S.defense spending will remain strong as the DoD continues to focus ontransforming the military and upgrading its assets." Mr. Lanza said that DoDpriorities include information distribution, network fusion, SIGINT, rapidstrike, ISR, communications, precision weaponry, improved training, aircraftmodernization and support, as well as new missions and sensors for unmanned airand land vehicles. With the military engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is aneed to ensure that existing aircraft, ships and land vehicles are upgraded andmaintained. These are all areas where L-3 has a significant presence."We believe that the DoD budget will grow at a conservative rate," continued Mr.Lanza. "Investors should understand that there is no problem with the DoDbudget; the budget itself is reasonable, although there will be a significantfocus on cost containment since the backlog of both new and desired programs for2005 does not fit into a reasonable 2007 budget and beyond."In fact, the DoD is currently assessing its upcoming requirements and hasalready demonstrated that it is prepared to cancel or delay new platforms andreallocate funding to meet the demands of transformation. That process shouldcontinue as the military prepares its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which isexpected to be released in the second half of 2005. "We believe that the DoDwill continue to either delay or cut new platforms," said Mr. Lanza, "but at thesame time allocate increased funding for transformation. This trend shouldbenefit L-3, because of L-3's portfolio of high technology products and servicesthat play heavily into the upgrade and modernization of present platforms aswell as those new platforms that will survive."In the area of homeland security, Mr. Lanza noted that the new BushAdministration has made it a priority to increase the homeland security budget,and Congress also is very concerned about protecting key infrastructure assets,including cargo, ports and maritime travel. In addition, Mr. Lanza expects thatthe government will be working toward upgrading its passenger portals andcarry-on baggage equipment to protect against other threats. L-3 has a broadbase of products for homeland security, including systems for aviation, cargo,port and maritime security, crisis management, border security and vehicles forrestoral communications and bioterrorism threats."The acquisition pipeline is full," continued Mr. Lanza. He said that there aremany defense companies with revenues in the $50 million to $300 million range aswell as assets from major platform companies that are on the market. Many ofthese companies are synergistic to L-3, have products that are number-one ornumber-two in their niches and have affordable EBITDA multiples. "You can expectthat in 2005, L-3 will continue to acquire companies in areas that wouldsupplement our products and services in intelligence, communications, sensors,training and simulation and government services."                                     -more-

As a result of the 2004 Business Realignments,     reclassifications between "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" and     "Commercial, primarily products" have been made to the prior period sales     and operating income amounts. Specifically, for the three months ended     December 31, 2003, $46.4 million of sales and $14.5 million of operating     income was reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government" to     "Commercial, primarily products," and $5.6 million of sales and $1.7     million of operating income was reclassified from "Commercial, primarily     products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government." For the twelve months     ended December 31, 2003, $96.5 million of sales and $26.3 million of     operating income was reclassified from "Contracts, primarily U.S.     Government" to "Commercial, primarily products," and $30.6 million of sales     and $2.1 million of operating income was reclassified from "Commercial     primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily U.S. Government." These 2004     Business Realignments and related reclassifications did not result in any     changes to consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash     flow.(b)  In order to calculate diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve     months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the after-tax interest expense     savings on the assumed conversions of Convertible Notes and our CODES must     be added to net income and then divided by the weighted average number of     shares outstanding. The amount to add to net income is $0.8 million for the     three months ended December 31, 2004, $4.5 million for the three months     ended December 31, 2003, $9.1 million for the twelve months ended December     31, 2004 and $20.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.(c)  Previously reported diluted EPS amounts have been restated in accordance     with EITF 04-8. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding     increased by 7.8 million shares, which resulted in non-cash reductions to     diluted EPS of $0.04 for the three months ended December 31, 2003, and     $0.09 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.                                     -more-

As a result of this realignment of management   responsibilities, $5.6 million of sales and $1.7 million of operating   income was reclassified from the Specialized Products segment to the   Training, Simulation & Government Services segment for the three months   ended December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003,   $29.1 million of sales and $3.9 million of operating income was   reclassified from the Specialized Products segment to the Training,   Simulation & Government Services segment.(e)The company discloses free cash flow because the company believes that,   subject to the limitations discussed below, it is one indicator of the   cash flow generated that is available for investing activities, other   than capital expenditures and financing activities. Free cash flow is   defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital   expenditures (capital expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions   of property, plant and equipment). Free cash flow represents cash   generated after paying for interest on borrowings, income taxes,   capital expenditures and changes in working capital, but before   repaying principal amount of outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on   common stock and investing cash to acquire businesses and making other   strategic investments. Thus, key assumptions underlying free cash flow   are that the company will be able to refinance its existing debt when   it matures with new debt, and that the company will be able to finance   any new business acquisitions it makes by raising new debt or equity   capital. Because of these assumptions, free cash flow is not a measure   that can be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow available   for discretionary expenditures.
