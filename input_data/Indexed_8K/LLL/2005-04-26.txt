"Congressional support for the 2005supplemental budget request is very strong and initial deliberations for the DoD2006 budget indicate that the investment account, which includes bothprocurement and research and development, will show growth.""In addition, conditions in Iraq have vastly improved. The Iraqi government isestablishing itself and continuing its infrastructure initiatives aimed atstabilizing the nation. U.S., Coalition and Iraqi forces have made significantprogress toward reducing the insurgency and U.S. commanders have indicated thatthey will be able to reduce the U.S. military presence in Iraq by the end of2005. These developments should lead to reduced funding to support theoperations in Iraq going forward, which will likely shift resources to other DoDinitiatives.""Also, lessons learned from the deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq have hadprofound effects on how the military is approaching the transformation of itsforces, strategies and assets, which will be reflected in its upcoming planningdocument, the Quadrennial Defense Review. It is expected that the transformationwill not be platform-centric. Instead, the focus will be on recapitalization ofexisting assets through steady evolutionary change, with spiral insertion toupgrade their capabilities and to meet readiness needs. This likely will resultin the need for fewer new platforms.""L-3 has key products, sub-systems, services and capabilities that are part ofthis transformation process," continued Mr. Lanza. He noted that the DoD willemphasize real time, persistent intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance,precision weaponry with in-flight retargeting and battle damage assessmentcapabilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), network-centric battlefieldawareness, joint operations, seamless command, control and communications,extreme mobility and survivability and rapid forward reach and positioning.                                    - more -
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS                   PAGE 6"We also expect that homeland security spending will continue to grow," said Mr.Lanza. "The new secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), MichaelChertoff, has initiated a comprehensive review of the organization, operationsand policies of the department, which should be completed in a few months. Webelieve that the DHS will identify and prioritize those infrastructure assetsthat need protection and fund necessary projects, while working in partnershipwith local authorities to protect those sites. Some of the areas of focus willbe container and cargo security requirements, port security, next-generationsensors for nuclear, biological and chemical detection, aircraft cabinsurveillance, maritime security and gateway portal scanners for passenger travel- - all areas where L-3 is well-positioned and offers products, services andexpertise.""The acquisition pipeline is robust," said Mr. Lanza. "We continue to reviewacquisition candidates that can add niche complementary capabilities to ourexpanding offerings. Our strategy is to look for companies that have products orservices that are number-one or number-two in their markets, add significantcapabilities to our base, have affordable EBITDA multiples and can be accretivewithin a year."FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2005Based on the 2005 first quarter results, the company revised its financialguidance for the year ending December 31, 2005, as follows:o    sales of approximately $8.2 billion, with growth of 19%, compared to 2004,     including organic sales growth of at least 10%, with the remaining growth     coming from business acquisitions;o    diluted earnings per share of between $4.00 and $4.05; operating margin of     approximately 11.1%, and an estimated effective income tax rate of between     35.5% and 36.0%. The effective income tax rate for the full year 2005 is     expected to decline in the second half of 2005 from the effective tax rate     of 36.2% for 2005 first quarter, upon the resolution of certain tax     contingencies; ando    free cash flow in excess of $600 million.

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased    by 7.8 million shares, which resulted in non-cash reductions to diluted EPS    of $0.02 for the three months ended March 31, 2004.                                    - more -

 flow generated that is available for investing, other than capital    expenditures and financing activities. Free cash flow is defined as net cash    from operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital    expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and    equipment). Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying for    interest on borrowings, income taxes, capital expenditures and changes in    working capital, but before repaying principal amount of outstanding debt,    paying cash dividends on common stock and investing cash to acquire    businesses and making other strategic investments. Thus, key assumptions    underlying free cash flow are that the company will be able to refinance    its existing debt when it matures with new debt, and that the company will    be able to finance any new acquisitions it makes by raising new debt or    equity capital. Because of these assumptions, free cash flow is not a    measure that can be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow    available for discretionary expenditures.
