The acquired businesses are primarily comprisedof Brashear LP, the Raytheon Commercial Infrared business and CincinnatiElectronics, Inc., which were acquired in 2004, and CAE's Marine Controlsdivision, Boeing Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc., and General Dynamics'Propulsion Systems business unit, which were acquired in the first half of 2005.Operating income was $46.0 million for the 2005 second quarter, compared with$31.8 million for the 2004 second quarter.

"It appears that the Pentagon may adjustits defense strategy, which would curtail the need for some platforms, stretchothers and reduce the quantities of other platforms. We anticipate prioritieswill be precision weapons, command, control, communications and ISR (C(3)ISR),three wings of F-22 aircraft, the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH), thefuture cargo aircraft, non line-of-sight (NLOS) cannon, a restructured FutureCombat System, Special Operations Forces and rapid deployment capabilities.""Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England will focus on acquisitionreform, including lines of responsibility, cost containment, verticalintegration, maintenance of the critical vendor base and accountability inindustry and military execution. Critical milestones will be the QDR completionand its shaping of the final transformation plan for the remainder of thisdecade, which includes the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process toinclude the overseas realignment study for the next few decades."                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2005 RESULTS                  PAGE 8Mr. Lanza also noted that the Iraqi political solution will dramatically affectfuture budget requirements for additional supplemental funding and the length ofpresent programs, as well as new platform starts."As a result, we believe that the continued transformation will not be definedas a radical transition to new platforms - that is too expensive and too riskyat a time when readiness and preparedness are the highest priorities. Instead,we expect that the DoD will contain costs and increase its capabilities byrecapitalizing existing platforms with spiral technology inserts. The focus willbe on real-time persistent ISR; UAVs; communications; precision weaponry within-flight retargeting; battle damage assessment capabilities; network-centricbattlefield awareness; joint operations; seamless command, control andcommunications; extreme mobility and survivability and rapid forward reach andpositioning.""L-3 will continue to invest its IR&D to support the transformation nowprojected by our military. We have extensive ISR and aircraft modernizationcapabilities and a wide array of state-of-the-art high technology products toaid the DoD in its transformation efforts," said Mr. Lanza. "But in addition toparticipating in three major U.S. budget categories - DoD's investment account(procurement and research and development), operations and maintenance and keyU.S. intelligence and civil agencies - L-3 is also well positioned for anothermajor budget; the growing homeland security budget.""Having suffered through the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Americanswere deeply saddened by the events that took place in London on July 7th," saidMr. Lanza. "We were also reminded of the number of vulnerabilities that continueto threaten our citizens, our country and our infrastructure, as well as thoseof our allies."Mr. Lanza noted that DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has announced somerealignments and changes to his agency and strategy. His priorities will involveprotecting against the most damaging kinds of terrorist activities, securingtransportation modes, improving screening technology and rolling out a new planfor port security, border protection and immigration. Mr. Lanza further notedthat L-3 has a number of products and services for federal, state and localgovernments, ranging from aviation, transportation and port security equipment,to crisis management systems and first responder vehicles for command andcommunications and biochemical detection."We must now focus on protecting major civilian hubs, which if attacked willresult in significant casualties, as well as the destruction of assets anddisruption of commerce, transportation or utilities that will cause majoreconomic impact to our country. It is hoped that the DHS and Congress aredeveloping a realistic analysis of threats and vulnerabilities and resultantpriorities to support the domestic security strategy for the country. There isno single silver bullet."Mr. Lanza noted there are many products available for perimeter protection,intrusion detection and weapon detection systems, proven effective that could beapplied to protect ports and major transportation hubs. All that is needed inthe U.S. is the funding from Congress and the implementation of a soundsolution."We are also very pleased with our preliminary review of the Titan acquisition.The company is synergistic with L-3 with its C(3)ISR, naval warfare in both airand surface, technical services and network communications. The fact that thecompany has 9,000 employees with U.S. government clearances, including over5,000 with top secret and above clearances and more than 2,400 with specialclearances is an extraordinary asset that we believe will benefit L-3 greatly aswe pursue new business opportunities.""As we look to the second half of 2005, we expect to exceed our annual growthtarget of 20% sales growth - 10% from organic growth and 10% from acquisitions,"said Mr. Lanza. "Our organic growth is driven by a solid defense budget and thefact that our offerings are well positioned to take advantage of the continuingtransformation of the U.S. military. There continues to be a good number ofaffordable acquisition candidates with revenues in the $50 million to $300million range that can add to our ISR, secure                                     -more-

For the six months ended June 30,     2004, $14.2 million of sales and $0.5 million of operating income was     reclassified from "Commercial, primarily products" to "Contracts, primarily     U.S. Government."  (b)In order to calculate diluted earnings per share for the three and six     months ended June 30, 2004, the after-tax interest expense savings on the     assumed conversion of the CODES must be added to net income and then     divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The amount to     add to net income is $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004     and $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004.  (c)Previously reported diluted EPS amounts have been restated in accordance     with EITF 04-8. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding     increased by 7.8 million shares which resulted in a non-cash reduction to     diluted EPS of $0.03 for the three months ended June 30, 2004. For the six     months ended June 30, 2004, diluted weighted average common shares     outstanding also increased by 7.8 million shares, which resulted in a     non-cash reduction to diluted EPS of $0.05.                                     -more-

Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net     capital expenditures (capital expenditures less cash proceeds from     dispositions of property, plant and equipment). Free cash flow represents     cash generated after paying for interest on borrowings, income taxes,     capital expenditures and changes in working capital, but before repaying     principal amount of outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on common stock     and investing cash to acquire businesses and making other strategic     investments. Thus, key assumptions underlying free cash flow are that the     company will be able to refinance its existing debt when it matures with     new debt, and that the company will be able to supplementally finance any     new acquisitions it makes by raising new debt or equity capital. Because of     these assumptions, free cash flow is not a measure that can be relied upon     to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary     expenditures.
