Consolidated organic(2) sales growth was 5.5%, or $97.5million, bringing the company's year to date organic sales growth to 12.0%, ontarget to achieve the full year estimate of over 10%. Organic sales growth forthe company's defense businesses was 6.4%, or $101.8 million, driven primarilyby continued strong demand for aircraft modernization and maintenance,government services, simulation devices, secure networked communications andacoustic undersea anti-submarine warfare products. Organic sales for thecompany's commercial businesses declined by 2.2%, or $4.3 million, primarily dueto volume decreases for commercial aviation products, which were partiallyoffset by increases for security products. The increase in consolidated salesfrom acquired businesses was $624.7 million, or 35.0%, including $443.7 milliondue to the acquisition of The Titan Corporation (Titan), which was acquired onJuly 29, 2005.Consolidated operating income for the 2005 third quarter increased by 33.7% to$266.5 million from $199.4 million for the 2004 third quarter. Consolidatedoperating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) decreased to 10.6%for the 2005 third quarter, compared to 11.2% for the 2004 third quarter. TheTitan acquired businesses reduced consolidated operating margin by 70 basispoints because Titan's business is largely performed under lower margin (andlower risk) cost-reimbursable type and time-and-material type contracts. Thechanges in operating margins for the company's segments are discussed below.Other income for the 2005 third quarter was $0.9 million, primarily due to $3.6million of interest income on the company's cash and cash equivalents, largelyoffset by a $3.0 million pre-tax charge to write-down the carrying value of anequity investment.Interest expense for the 2005 third quarter increased by $25.0 million to $59.9million, or 71.6%, compared to the 2004 third quarter, primarily due to interestincurred on debt issued to finance the Titan acquisition.- -----------Notes:(1)   See discussions and calculations of free cash flow on the table of      selected financial data attached to this press release.(2)   Organic sales growth is defined as the current period vs. prior period      increase or decrease in sales excluding the increase in sales from      acquired businesses.                                     -more-

Net income for the 2005 third quarter increased by32.0% to $135.3 million, compared to net income of $102.5 million for the 2004third quarter.As expected, the company's effective income tax rate declined to 34.0% for the2005 third quarter from 36.2% for the 2005 first half, primarily as a result ofa favorable disposition of certain tax contingencies. This tax benefit waspartially offset by an increase to the effective income tax rate caused by theacquisition of Titan, which is expected to reduce, on a relative basis, thecompany's tax credits for research and experimentation expenditures. Refer tothe "Calendar Year 2005 Financial Guidance" section below, for furtherdiscussion of the estimated tax rate for 2005.For the 2005 third quarter, funded orders increased by 35.0% to $2,632.4million, compared to funded orders of $1,950.1 million for the 2004 thirdquarter.

Consolidated organic salesgrowth was 12.0%, or $598.7 million. Organic sales growth for the company'sdefense businesses was 12.0%, or $535.9 million, driven primarily by continuedstrong demand for secure networked communications and intelligence, surveillanceand reconnaissance (ISR) systems and products, aircraft modernization andmaintenance, government services, simulation devices and naval power equipment.Organic sales growth for the company's commercial businesses was 12.0%, or $62.8million, primarily due to volume increases for security products and commercialaviation products. The increase in consolidated sales from acquired businesseswas $960.0 million, or 19.3%.Consolidated operating income for the 2005 nine-month period increased by 30.5%to $690.6 million from $529.1 million for the 2004 nine-month period.Consolidated operating margin was unchanged at 10.6% for both the 2005 and 2004nine-month periods. The Titan acquired businesses reduced the 2005 nine-monthperiod consolidated operating margin by 20 basis points.Other income for the 2005 nine-month period was $6.4 million, primarilycomprised of interest income on the company's cash and cash equivalents,partially offset by a write-down of the carrying value of an equity investment.Interest expense for the 2005 nine-month period increased by $29.7 million to$136.5 million, or 27.8%, compared to the 2004 nine-month period, primarily dueto interest incurred on debt issued to finance the Titan acquisition.Diluted EPS increased by 27.2% to $2.95 for the 2005 nine-month period, comparedto $2.32 for the 2004 nine-month period.

The increase was primarily due to the issuanceof $2,450.0 million of debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Titan.Available borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities afterreduction for outstanding letters of credit were approximately $886.7 million atSeptember 30, 2005.Shareholders' equity increased by $509.5 million to $4,309.3 million atSeptember 30, 2005, from $3,799.8 million at December 31, 2004. The increase isprimarily due to the company's net income, less dividends paid plus proceedsfrom the exercise of stock options during the 2005 nine-month period.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSDuring the 2005 third quarter, the company integrated the Titan acquiredbusinesses into L-3. Titan's eight legacy business sectors (excluding Titan'sproducts businesses) were consolidated into four new L-3 divisions arranged tofocus on Titan's unique and complimentary businesses. These four divisionsrepresent a new L-3 operating group, named the L-3 Titan Group, led by TonyFrederickson, and are included in L-3's reportable segments as follows:o    Intelligence Solutions, which provides support to the Department of Defense     (DoD) and intelligence agencies (C(3)ISR segment);o    Technical & Management Services, which provides continental U.S. (CONUS)     and outside continental U.S. (OCONUS) support of intelligence, logistics,     Command, Control and Communications (C(3)), and combatant commands (C(3)ISR     segment);o    Aviation & Maritime Services, which provides support for maritime and     expeditionary warfare (Government Services segment); ando    Enterprise Solutions, which provides conventional high-end information     technology (IT) support to U.S. federal agencies and the DoD (Government     Services segment).Additionally, Titan's Technical and Operational Support division was integratedinto L-3's Government Services Group, which is led by General Carl Vuono, andwas renamed the Linguist Operations and Technical Support division. L-3'sGovernment Services reportable segment is now principally focused on governmentservices, managed by General Vuono and Mr. Frederickson, with estimated fullyear 2006 sales of approximately $2.7 billion.Titan's remaining legacy businesses, which are products focused, were integratedinto four existing L-3 operating groups that are all included in L-3'sSpecialized Products reportable segment, as follows:o    Information Products into L-3's Microwave Group;o    Unidyne (Titan's ship modernization and modification business) into L-3's     Power & Controls Systems Group;o    Advanced Systems Development into L-3's Sensors & Simulation Group; ando    Applied Technologies into L-3's Products Group.                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2005 RESULTS                  PAGE 4During the 2005 third quarter, L-3 also revised the aggregation of its divisionsinto its four reportable segments, to provide a more clearly definedpresentation of L-3's businesses, focused on customers, markets, and independentresearch and development. Consequently, the company made certain re-alignmentsto its reportable segments, reclassifying into the Specialized Productsreportable segment, (i) L-3's aviation products businesses, which werepreviously in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance reportable segment(formerly Aircraft Modernization, O&M and Products), and (ii) the Link Trainingbusiness, which was previously in the Government Services reportable segment.The company's reportable segments are now:o     C(3)ISR;o     Government Services;o     Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M); ando     Specialized Products.Refer to the "Reportable Segment Selected Financial Data" tables attached tothis press release which present (1) the previous reportable segment data asreported for the three years ended December 31, 2004, the quarterly periodsended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2004, and the quarterlyperiods ended March 31, and June 30, 2005; (2) the reclassifications for theseperiods to our reportable segments; and (3) the revised reportable segment datapresentation for these periods.C(3)ISRC(3)ISR sales for the 2005 third quarter increased by $160.9 million, or 36.4%,to $603.3 million from sales of $442.4 million for the 2004 third quarter. Theincrease in sales from acquired businesses was $157.0 million, including $154.9million for the Titan acquired businesses. Organic sales growth was $3.9million, or 0.9%, driven by demand for secure network communications. Volume forsecure terminal equipment increased slightly. Sales for the C(3)ISR segment werelower than expected in the 2005 third quarter primarily because of delays in thereceipt and induction of customer furnished aircraft that will be upgraded withairborne mission and ISR systems, and such sales are expected to occur in the2005 fourth quarter. C(3)ISR generated operating income of $69.6 million for the2005 third quarter, compared to $53.6 million for the 2004 third quarter.Operating margin decreased to 11.5% from 12.1% for the 2004 third quarter. Thedecrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower margins from the Titanacquired businesses and unit sales prices on a follow-on contract for secureterminal equipment, which are lower than those on the previous contract. Fullyear 2005 operating margins for this segment are expected to be between 11% and12%. Orders for the C(3)ISR segment were $643.5 million during the 2005 thirdquarter.For the 2005 nine-month period, sales for C(3)ISR increased by $224.6 million,or 18.1%, to $1,464.9 million from sales of $1,240.3 million for the 2004nine-month period. The increase in sales from acquired businesses was $162.0million. Organic sales growth was $62.6 million, or 5.0%. C(3)ISR generatedoperating income of $178.5 million for the 2005 nine-month period, compared to$156.6 million for the 2004 nine-month period. Operating margin decreased to12.2% from 12.6%. The trends affecting C(3)ISR results for the 2005 nine-monthperiod were similar to those affecting the 2005 third quarter, but upgrades ofairborne mission and ISR systems for allied foreign governments also increasedduring the 2005 nine-month period.GOVERNMENT SERVICESGovernment Services sales for the 2005 third quarter increased by $274.4million, or 98.3%, to $553.6 million from sales of $279.2 million for the 2004third quarter. The increase in sales from acquired businesses was $245.9million, including $233.6 million for the Titan acquired businesses. Theacquired businesses also included D.P. Associates Inc., which was acquired in2004. Organic sales growth was $28.5 million, or 10.2%, driven primarily byincreased volume in international training services and logistics andcommunication systems and software engineering services for the U.S. Army.Government Services generated operating income of $47.4 million for the 2005third quarter, compared to $28.3 million for the                                     -more-

GovernmentServices generated operating income of $103.1 million for the 2005 nine-monthperiod, compared to $85.1 million for the 2004 nine-month period. Operatingmargin decreased to 9.0% from 11.1%. The trends affecting Government Servicesresults for the 2005 nine-month period were similar to those affecting the 2005third quarter, but also included higher sales due to increased support servicesfor the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and lower margins, due to cost overruns oncertain fixed price contracts and lower absorption of indirect costs primarilybecause of timing and sales volume.AIRCRAFT MODERNIZATION AND MAINTENANCEAM&M sales for the 2005 third quarter increased by $78.9 million, or 16.8%, to$549.0 million from sales of $470.1 million in the 2004 third quarter. Organicsales growth was $57.4 million, or 12.2%, driven by higher sales on aircraftbase operations, support and maintenance, and support services for the recentcompetitively awarded Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (MHP). The increasein sales from the L-3 Electronics Systems acquired business, which was acquiredon December 30, 2004, was $21.5 million. Operating income was $56.4 million forthe 2005 third quarter, compared to $59.7 million for the 2004 third quarter.Operating margin decreased to 10.3% from 12.7%, primarily due to higher salesvolume of lower margin aircraft base operations and support and maintenance,which are primarily performed under cost-reimbursable type and time-and-materialtype contracts. Additionally, the 2004 third quarter included the initialrecognition of incentive fees on a new contract for which performance commencedin December of 2003, because the realization of such fees became determinable inthe 2004 third quarter. Full year 2005 operating margins for this segment areexpected to be approximately 9%. Orders for the AM&M segment were $507.8 millionduring the 2005 third quarter.For the 2005 nine-month period, sales for AM&M increased by $336.2 million, or24.6%, to $1,704.9 million from sales of $1,368.7 million for the 2004nine-month period.

These increases were partially offset by volumedeclines for commercial aviation products. Operating income was $93.1 millionfor the 2005 third quarter, compared to $57.8 million for the 2004 thirdquarter. Operating margin increased to 11.6% from 9.7%, primarily because oflower reliability costs related to repairs of certain airborne dipping sonarsused for acoustic undersea warfare applications, continued cost improvements fornaval power equipment and higher margins for acquired businesses. Full year 2005operating margins for this segment are expected to be between 10% and 11%.Orders for the Specialized Products segment were $915.0 million during the 2005third quarter.                                     -more-

"Our businesses are on track toperform well as we conclude the year and move into 2006. In fact, thePresident's 2006 defense budget is $419.3 billion, a 4.8% increase over fiscalyear 2005, and there are many opportunities for L-3 within that budget." OnOctober 7, Congress also approved $50 billion for the wars in Iraq andAfghanistan and for U.S. military efforts involving its global war on terrorism.The initial Congressional marks indicate sustained growth in the investmentaccounts and with increased demands on the federal budget, one should anticipatemarginal growth in the 2007-2011 time period. We expect supplementals in 2006and 2007 and steady growth in the basic investment account, reaching $165billion from today's $145 billion by 2010.Mr. Lanza noted that the focus in the 2006 U.S. DoD budget will be to transformcapabilities and technologies that modernize its forces and enhance presentplatforms. The DoD's key transformational segments include C(3)ISR, SpecialOperating Forces (SOF), mobility programs, command and control, precisionweaponry, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), fast sea lift, and unmanned land andsea platforms.                                     -more-
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2005 RESULTS                  PAGE 7The DoD is placing an emphasis on stability initiatives - including peaceoperations, "fragile state" operations, post-conflict reconstruction, as well astraining, simulators, mobilization, leap-ahead technologies and littoralcombatants. Additionally, the need for a significant reduction in tactical airplatforms is gaining support."However, our view continues to be that with the upcoming announcement of theQuadrennial Defense Review (QDR), 2007 will be a defining year for U.S. defensespending," said Mr. Lanza. "We believe that U.S. defense spending growth in 2007and beyond will not be as robust as in previous years. There are a number ofpressure points that will impact overall government spending and the DoD budget,such as the federal deficit, the high cost of rebuilding Gulf Coast areasaffected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, budgetary supplementals to pay for thewar in Iraq and the Iraq sustainment, as well as mandatory readiness requiringspiral modernization of present assets.""And so we are beginning to see signs that defense spending priorities arechanging to reflect the reality of prudent DoD spending and the variety ofpotential threats faced by the U.S. military," said Mr. Lanza. "There has beenspeculation that the QDR will balance military planning toward preparation forirregular warfare, traditional threats and Homeland Security."Kenneth Krieg, the Pentagon's undersecretary for acquisition, also warneddefense contractors to expect cuts in new platforms in the future. WhileUndersecretary Krieg was not specific about which programs would be cut, manyobservers believe the Pentagon was signaling its intent to cancel somehigh-profile new platforms rather than make small reductions to a number ofprograms. In order to ensure readiness, the Pentagon will then have to focus onthe modernization and spiral upgrade of existing assets, which is acost-efficient way to preserve the military's investments while increasing itscapabilities. Intrinsic in his comments is for industry to cooperate and notpolitically engage in an adversarial movement."We also believe that the U.S. military will begin withdrawing a number oftroops from Iraq," said Mr. Lanza, "as Iraqi forces assume more day-to-dayresponsibility for their country. That will prompt the reset of a considerablenumber of aircraft, ships and ground vehicles for maintenance and upgrade, whichshould provide significant opportunities for L-3."In the area of homeland security, Mr. Lanza noted that there are growthopportunities for L-3 in both the domestic and international markets. The U.S.government has allocated funds for new aviation security initiatives, includingresearch and development (R&D), state-of-the-art equipment and the deploymentinto airports. The international market for aviation and cargo security andintrusion detection is also growing.Mr. Lanza also said that the recent hurricanes have prompted U.S. cities andstates to review their crisis management and communications capabilities. Thedemand for L-3's communications restoral and command and control vehicles hasincreased, along with L-3's port security solutions. In addition, in themaritime security area, L-3's Automatic Identification System (AIS), which iscompliant with International Maritime Organization (IMO) security requirements,continues to perform well.Calendar Year 2005 Financial Guidance. Based on the 2005 third quarter results,the company updated its financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2005as follows:o    sales in excess of $9.3 billion, with total growth of about 35% compared to     2004, including organic growth of over 10% and the remaining sales growth     coming from business acquisitions;o    diluted EPS of between $4.12 and $4.15, with operating margin of     approximately 10.6% and an estimated full-year effective income tax rate of     approximately 35.7% (approximately 36.5% for the fourth quarter); ando    free cash flow in excess of $650 million.

The     full year 2005 free cash flow estimate excludes the $67.4 million expected     to be paid in the                                     -more-

The amount to    add to net income is $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30,    2004 and $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Also,    previously reported diluted EPS amounts have been restated in accordance    with EITF 04-8. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004,    diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased by 7.8 million    shares which resulted in a non-cash reduction to diluted EPS. The non-cash    reduction in diluted EPS was $0.04 for the three months ended September 30,    2004 and $0.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.                                    - more -

The company discloses free cash flow because the company believes           that, subject to the limitations discussed below, it is one indicator           of the cash flow generated that is available for investing and           financing activities. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from           operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital           expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant           and equipment). Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying           for interest on borrowings, income taxes, capital expenditures and           changes in working capital, but before repaying principal amount of           outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on common stock and investing           cash to acquire businesses and making other strategic investments.           Thus, key assumptions underlying free cash flow are that the company           will be able to refinance its existing debt when it matures with new           debt, and that the company will be able to supplementally finance any           new acquisitions it makes by raising new debt or equity capital.           Because of these assumptions, free cash flow is not a measure that           can be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow available for           discretionary expenditures.                                    - more -
