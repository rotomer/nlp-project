Exhibit 99
L-3 COMMUNICATIONS REVISES 2007 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR LOSS OF LINGUIST CONTRACT
NEW YORK, NY, December 18, 2006  L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) announced today that the U.S. Armys Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) did not select L-3s contract proposal to provide translators and linguists worldwide, including support to the U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as related activities at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. L-3 is the incumbent contractor on the linguist contract, which contract ends, in accordance with its terms, on March 9, 2007. The linguist contract was assumed by L-3 as part of its acquisition of The Titan Corporation, which was completed on July 29, 2005.
Michael T. Strianese, L-3s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, said, While the company is disappointed about the loss of the contract, we maintain our full support and confidence in our exceptional employees who have made the current worldwide linguist contract a success.
The company is revising its financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2007, as a result of the loss of the linguist contract, as summarized in the attached table. L-3s recently announced guidance for 2007 assumed that the company would win the recompetition of the linguist contract. The loss of the linguist contract does not affect the companys previously announced financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2006. Despite the loss, L-3 remains well positioned for profitable growth in 2007 and beyond.
Headquartered in New York City, L-3 Communications is a leading provider of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, secure communications systems, aircraft modernization, training and government services. The company is a leading merchant supplier of a broad array of high technology products, including guidance and navigation, sensors, scanners, fuzes, data links, propulsion systems, simulators, avionics, electro optics, satellite communications, electrical power equipment, encryption, signal intelligence, antennas and microwave components.

Its customers include the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, selected U.S. Government intelligence agencies and aerospace prime contractors.
