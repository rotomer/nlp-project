L-3 ANNOUNCES A NEW $750 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
NEW YORK, NY, December 11, 2007  L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

We are pleased to increase our share repurchase program, said Michael T. Strianese, President and Chief Executive Officer of L-3. L-3 is committed to disciplined capital allocation, which includes productively deploying the companys strong cash flow to increase shareholder value. Our share repurchases will continue to supplement the cash we return to shareholders with dividends.
This new share repurchase authorization represents L-3s second authorization.  The first occurred in December 2006 and was for $500 million over two years.  The company expects to complete the first repurchase authorization by the end of 2007.
Repurchases under the program may be made through open market purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or any combination thereof, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by the companys management and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The program will be funded using the companys cash on hand and cash generated from operations. The program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
