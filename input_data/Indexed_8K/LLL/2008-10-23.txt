Exhibit 99
NEW YORK, October 23, 2008  L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted EPS of $1.73 for the quarter ended Sept. 26, 2008 (2008 third quarter), up 11%, compared to $1.56 for the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2007 (2007 third quarter). Net sales increased 6% to $3.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion for the 2007 third quarter. The 2008 third quarter net cash from operating activities was $403 million, compared to $324 million for the 2007 third quarter.
"Our third quarter results continued the strong momentum we established during the first half of the year, with gains in sales and operating income that resulted in EPS of $1.73 and free cash flow of $340 million for the quarter," said Michael T. Strianese, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We continued to deploy the company's cash flow to increase shareholder value, with share repurchases totaling $688 million. We also paid dividends of $37 million during the third quarter and $111 million year-to-date."

Consolidated Results
For the 2008 third quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6% compared to the 2007 third quarter driven by continued strong demand for ISR systems, networked communication systems, engineering solution services, base support services, and several specialized product areas, including simulation & training, power & control systems and precision engagement. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in linguist services. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $74 million, or 2%.
Third Quarter Results of Operations:
(3)
The 2008 third quarter operating income increased by $29 million to $400 million compared to $371 million for the 2007 third quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin), increased by 10 basis points to 10.9% compared to the 2007 third quarter. See Segment Results below for additional discussion of segment operating income and margin results.
Interest expense and other items for the 2008 third quarter decreased compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.
The effective tax rate for the 2008 third quarter increased by 280 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to: (1) a benefit in the 2007 third quarter for a reversal of previously accrued amounts related to the 2003 U.S. Federal income tax return that did not recur in the 2008 third quarter, and (2) the expiration of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit on Dec. 31, 2007 that was re-enacted on Oct. 3, 2008, which did not effect the 2008 third quarter.
In the 2008 third quarter as compared to the 2007 third quarter, diluted EPS increased by $0.17, or 11%, to $1.73 from $1.56, and net income for the 2008 third quarter increased by $13 million to $212 million from $199 million.
 
 
For the year-to date period ended Sept. 26, 2008 (2008 year-to date period), consolidated net sales increased 7% compared to the year-to date period ended Sept. 28, 2007 (2007 year-to date period). The increase was driven by continued strong demand for networked communication systems, ISR systems, government services, base and aircraft support services and several specialized product areas, including power & control systems, microwave products, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) products, precision engagement, and simulation & training. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in linguist services. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $199 million, or 2%.
Year-to-Date Results of Operation:
The 2008 year-to-date period results were impacted by three items aggregating a net gain of $0.57 per diluted share, which are collectively referred to as the Q2 2008 Items:
Operating income for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by $217 million to $1,269 million from $1,052 million for the 2007 year-to-date period. The Q2 2008 Items increased consolidated operating income by an aggregate $110 million. Excluding the Q2 2008 Items, consolidated operating margin increased by 20 basis points to 10.6% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period.
Interest expense and other items for the 2008 year-to-date period decreased compared to the same period last year because of the reversal of $7 million of accrued interest during the 2008 second quarter in connection with the Litigation Gain. Lower interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt also reduced interest expense for the 2008 year-to-date period as compared to the 2007 year-to-date period.
The effective tax rate for the 2008 year-to-date period compared to the same period last year increased by 200 basis points. The Q2 2008 Items increased the effective tax rate by 30 basis points. The remaining increase was primarily driven by: (1) a benefit for a reversal of previously accrued amounts related to the 2002 and 2003 U.S. Federal income tax returns that did not recur in the 2008 year-to-date period, and (2) the expiration of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit on Dec. 31, 2007 that was re-enacted on Oct. 3, 2008, which did not effect the 2008 year-to-date period.
In the 2008 year-to-date period as compared to the 2007 year-to-date period, diluted EPS increased by $1.17 to $5.51 from $4.34, and net income for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by $133 million to $682 million from $549 million. Excluding the Q2 2008 Items, diluted EPS increased $0.60 to $4.94 and net income increased $62 million to $611 million.
Funded orders for the 2008 third quarter increased 10% to $4.0 billion from $3.6 billion for the 2007 third quarter and increased 12% to $12.2 billion for the 2008 year-to-date period from $10.9 billion for the 2007 year-to-date period. Funded backlog increased 18% to $11.3 billion at Sept. 26, 2008, from $9.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2007. Highlights of recent contract awards include:
Orders:
 
Net cash from operating activities for the 2008 third quarter was $403 million compared with $324 million for the 2007 third quarter. Free cash flow for the 2008 third quarter was $340 million compared with $290 million for the 2007 third quarter. Net cash from operating activities for the 2008 year-to-date period was $1,031 million compared with $935 million for the 2007 year-to-date period. Free cash flow for the 2008 year-to-date period was $897 million compared with $836 million for the 2007 year-to-date period.
Cash flow:
The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $77 million to $857 million at Sept. 26, 2008, from $780 million at Dec. 31, 2007. The increase was principally due to the company's 2008 year-to-date period free cash flow, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases, dividends and business acquisitions.
Total debt at Sept. 26, 2008, remained at $4.5 billion compared to Dec. 31, 2007. Available borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities, after reduction for outstanding letters of credit, were $957 million at Sept. 26, 2008. Shareholders' equity increased by $186 million to $6,175 million at Sept. 26, 2008, from $5,989 million at Dec. 31, 2007.
On Oct. 8, 2008, we sold our interest in a business that will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $29 million. The gain on the sale will be recorded in the results of operations for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2008.
Fourth Quarter Business Divestiture:
Segment Results
Command, Control, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C
3
ISR)
CISR net sales for the 2008 third quarter increased by 20% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily due to continued demand and new contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD) for airborne ISR and networked communication systems for manned and unmanned platforms.
Third Quarter:
3
CISR operating income for the 2008 third quarter increased by 23% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily because of higher sales volume and higher operating margin. Operating margin increased by 20 basis points. Higher sales volume for networked communication systems and lower development costs for new secure communications products were partially offset by higher costs for international airborne ISR systems.
3
CISR net sales for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 13% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period driven by trends similar to those for the 2008 third quarter. Sales growth was lower in the 2008 year-to-date period compared to the 2008 third quarter because of lower sales growth during the 2008 first quarter due to timing of airborne ISR system deliveries.
Year-to-Date:
3
CISR operating income for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 25% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period primarily because of higher sales volume and higher operating margin. Operating margin increased by 100 basis points due primarily to higher sales volume and improved contract performance for airborne ISR and networked communication systems, and lower development costs for new secure communication products.
3
Government Services
 
Government Services net sales for the 2008 third quarter decreased by 6% compared to the 2007 third quarter. A decline for linguist services of $124 million was partially offset by increases primarily for engineering solution services to the DoD. The decline in linguist services is due to a decline in L-3's work share in connection with the transition on June 9, 2008 from an L-3 prime contract to a subcontract following the loss of a previous contract upon re-competition. Total linguist-Iraq sales were $56 million for the 2008 third quarter. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $15 million, or 1%.
Third Quarter:
Government Services operating income for the 2008 third quarter decreased by 9% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily because of lower sales and lower operating margin. Operating margin for the 2008 third quarter decreased by 40 basis points. Operating margin declined by 60 basis points primarily due to lower sell prices on certain new contracts. A decline in lower margin linguist sales improved operating margin by 10 basis points. Acquired businesses increased operating margin by 10 basis points.
Government Services net sales for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by approximately 1% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $44 million. A decline in sales of $168 million for linguist services was largely offset by an increase in sales primarily for the DoD for training, information technology, engineering solution services and other support services. Total linguist-Iraq sales for the 2008 year-to-date period were $356 million.
Year-to-Date:
Government Services operating income for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 6% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period primarily because of higher sales and higher operating margin. Operating margin for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 50 basis points compared to the 2007 year-to-date period primarily due to higher sales and lower indirect costs as a percentage of sales. Operating margin increased by 10 basis points because of a decline in lower margin linguist sales. These increases were partially offset by approximately $4 million, or 10 basis points, for severance and other costs related to business realignment and consolidation activities.
Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M)
AM&M net sales for the 2008 third quarter increased by 2% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily driven by higher sales for base and aircraft support services and the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) contract. These increases were partially offset by lower aircraft modernization sales for international customers.
Third Quarter:
AM&M operating income for the 2008 third quarter increased by 10% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily because of higher sales volume and higher operating margin. Operating margin for the 2008 third quarter compared to the 2007 third quarter increased by 90 basis points. Improved contract performance, including delivery incentive fees, increased operating margin by 30 basis points and an adjustment of approximately $3 million to litigation accruals for costs to settle certain claims increased operating margin by 60 basis points.
AM&M net sales for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 2% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period. The increase was primarily driven by higher base and aircraft support services and the JCA contract. These increases were partially offset by lower sales for: (1) the Canadian Maritime Helicopter program due to previously completed milestones, and (2) aircraft modernization, primarily to modify C-130 aircraft for international customers and head-of-state aircraft for foreign government customers.
Year-to-Date:
AM&M operating income for the 2008 year-to-date period decreased by 7% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period primarily because of lower operating margin partially offset by higher sales volume. Operating margin for the 2008 year-to-date period compared to the 2007 year-to-date period decreased by 100 basis points. The 2008 year-to-date period includes $10 million of litigation accruals for costs to settle certain claims, which reduced operating margin by 50 basis points. Operating margin for the 2008 year-to-date period compared to
 
the 2007 year-to-date period also declined by another 50 basis points due to change in sales mix, primarily the JCA contract, and lower international sales, partially offset by improved contract performance.
Specialized Products
Specialized Products net sales for the 2008 third quarter increased by 14% compared to the 2007 third quarter reflecting higher sales volume primarily for: (1) simulation & training due to timing of deliveries, (2) power & control systems mostly for commercial shipbuilding, (3) precision engagement primarily related to new contracts and timing of deliveries on existing contracts, and (4) EO/IR products primarily due to higher demand and deliveries from existing and follow-on contracts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease for displays due to timing of contractual deliveries and completed contracts. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $59 million, or 5%.
Third Quarter:
Specialized Products operating income for the 2008 third quarter increased by 14% compared to the 2007 third quarter primarily because of higher sales volume. Operating margin for the 2008 third quarter was unchanged compared to the 2007 third quarter. Contract performance and higher sales across several business areas increased operating margin by 40 basis points and acquired businesses increased operating margin by 40 basis points. These increases were offset by 30 basis points due to an adjustment of $4 million to certain litigation accruals for costs to settle a claim. In addition, a $7 million gain in the 2007 third quarter from the settlement of a third party claim that did not recur decreased operating margin by 50 basis points.
Specialized Products net sales for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 13% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period reflecting higher sales volume primarily for: (1) power & control systems mostly for commercial shipbuilding, (2) microwave products due to higher demand and deliveries of mobile communications systems and satellite and space components for the U.S. military, (3) precision engagement primarily related to new contracts and increased shipments of fuzing products, (4) EO/IR products primarily due to higher demand and deliveries on existing and follow-on contracts, and (5) simulation & training primarily related to timing of deliveries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease for displays due to timing of contractual deliveries and completed contracts. The increase in net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, was $155 million, or 5%.
Year-to-Date:
Specialized Products operating income for the 2008 year-to-date period increased by 12% compared to the 2007 year-to-date period primarily because of higher sales volume partially offset by lower operating margins. The 2008 year-to-date period includes a gain of $12 million for the Product Line Divestiture Gain and a $28 million non-cash Impairment Charge. Excluding these two items, operating income was $473.0 million and operating margin increased 20 basis points to 12.1%. Operating margin increased by 60 basis points due to improved contract performance and higher sales across several business areas. These increases were partially offset by 20 basis points due to $6 million of litigation accruals to settle a claim. Additionally, a $7 million gain from the settlement of a claim against a third party in the 2007 third quarter that did not recur decreased operating margin by 20 basis points.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain of the matters discussed in this release that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as ''expects,'' ''anticipates,'' ''intends,'' ''plans,'' ''believes,'' ''estimates,'' and similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, including projections of total sales growth, sales growth from business acquisitions, organic sales growth, consolidated operating margins, total segment operating margins, interest expense, earnings, cash flow, research and development costs, working capital, capital expenditures and other projections, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, and therefore, we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved. Such statements will also be influenced by factors which include, among other things: our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of, or contractors to, the U.S. Government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding our contracts with the U.S. or foreign governments and the results of any investigation of our contracts undertaken by the U.S. or foreign governments; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts (revenue arrangements); our ability to successfully compete for and win new business and related contracts (revenue arrangements) and to win re-competitions of our existing contracts; our ability to identify and acquire additional businesses in the future with terms that are attractive to L-3 and to integrate acquired business operations; our ability to maintain and improve our consolidated operating margin and total segment operating margin in future periods; our ability to obtain future government contracts (revenue arrangements) on a timely basis; election year uncertainties; the availability of government funding or cost-cutting initiatives and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions
 
contained in our debt agreements; our ability to continue to retain and train our existing employees and to recruit and hire new qualified and skilled employees as well as our ability to retain and hire employees with U.S. Government Security clearances; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and stock options amounts; our collective bargaining agreements, our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; global economic uncertainty and tightening of the credit markets; our ability to perform contracts on schedule; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our international operations; our extensive use of fixed-price type contracts as compared to cost-reimbursable type and time-and-material type contracts; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in the defense industry and the commercial industries in which our businesses participate; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; the outcome of litigation matters; anticipated cost savings from business acquisitions not fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; Titan's compliance with its plea agreement and consent to entry of judgment with the U.S. Government relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including Titan's ability to maintain its export licenses; ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations; competitive pressure among companies in our industry; and the fair values of our assets, which can be impaired or reduced by other factors, some of which are discussed above.
For a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see ''Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors'' and Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2007.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this release to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
