ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
AND
SECTION 2  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
     On October 23, 2009, in connection with its entry into a new credit agreement on such date (as discussed below), L-3 Communications Corporation ("L-3 Communications"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), terminated its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 29, 2005 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time) (the "Prior Credit Agreement") among L-3 Communications, the guarantors party thereto, the several lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as administrative agent, swing line lender and an L/C issuer.
     The Prior Credit Agreement provided for total aggregate borrowings of $1,000,000,000 under a revolving facility, up to $750,000,000 under a term loan facility, swing line loans made available by the swing line lender and L/C credit advances. The loans under the Prior Credit Agreement were due and payable on March 9, 2010 and were (1) base rate loans, which bore interest at a rate equal to the sum of (A) the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% and the Bank of America prime rate as publicly announced from time to time (the "Base Rate") plus (B) the Applicable Rate as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement, and/or (2) eurodollar loans, which bore interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate for base rate loans ranged from 0% to 0.750%, and the Applicable Rate for eurodollar loans ranged from 0.625% to 1.750%, in each case based on L-3 Communications' non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt rating.
     L-3 Communications did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.
     On October 23, 2009, L-3 Communications also entered into a new credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"), among L-3 Communications, the guarantors party thereto, the several lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, as administrative agent, swing line lender and an L/C issuer.
     The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for total aggregate borrowings of $1,000,000,000 under a revolving credit facility, swing line loans made available by the swing line lender and L/C credit advances. The loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement are due and payable on October 23, 2012 and may be (1) base rate loans, which shall bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of the Applicable Rate, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the highest of (A) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (B) the Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement for a one-month interest period, plus 1%, and (C) Bank of America's prime rate, and/or (2) eurodollar loans, which shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate for base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 3.00%, and the Applicable Rate for eurodollar loans ranges from 2.25% to 4.00%, in each case based on L-3 Communications' non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt rating.
     The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and covenants, including, among other things, covenants that restrict the ability of L-3 Communications and certain of its subsidiaries to create or permit liens on assets, make certain investments and certain payments with respect to its equity interests and engage in certain mergers or consolidations. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants restricting L-3 Communications' consolidated interest coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio. The Prior Credit Agreement required L-3 Communications' consolidated leverage ratio to be less than or equal to (1) 4.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2005, (2) 4.25 to 1 for the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2006 and (3) 4.0 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2006. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires L-3 Communications' consolidated leverage ratio to be less than 4.0 to 1.0. Extensions of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of L-3 Communications' wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries until certain ratings thresholds are reached.
     The lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided and may, from time to time, continue to provide investment banking, financial advisory and other services to Holdings and L-3 Communications, for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses, and for which they expect to receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses, respectively. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Revolving Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     (iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

If any Lender becomes
 
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. If the Borrower so notifies the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after any Lender notifies the Borrower of any increased cost pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Borrower may convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender then outstanding into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the terms hereof.
     (b) . If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount deemed by such Lender be material in its sole discretion, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

Certificates for Reimbursement
     (d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests

Each Lender claiming any payment pursuant to this shall do so by giving notice thereof to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (showing calculation of the amount claimed in reasonable detail) within 60 Business Days after a failure to borrow, convert or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to prepay, after notice or after a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period therefor.
