On June 21, 2010, L-3 Communications Corporation received notice from U.S. Special Operations Command that the follow-on Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) contract was not awarded to L-3.

The company intends to update its full year 2010 guidance on July 27, 2010 in connection with its release of second quarter 2010 results.
