Exhibit 99
NEW YORK, October 27, 2011  L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported an 8% increase in diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) to $2.24 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 (2011 third quarter) compared with $2.07 for the quarter ended September 24, 2010 (2010 third quarter). Net sales of $3.8 billion decreased by approximately 1% compared to the 2010 third quarter.
"Overall, we had a solid third quarter, underscored by strong orders, cash flow and EPS. Sales performance reflected our areas of competitive strength as well as a challenging defense budget environment. CISR sales grew by 13%, and sales were also strong in intelligence and cyber support within Government Services and contractor logistics support within AM&M due to recent competitive wins. Also, volume increased for EO/IR and commercial shipbuilding products within Electronic Systems. At the same time, certain businesses within AM&M, Government Services and Electronic Systems continue to experience budgetary headwinds. We ended the quarter with funded backlog of $11.5 billion," said Michael T. Strianese, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, our focus will be on strengthening the company by continuing our outstanding program performance, providing affordable solutions that address customer imperatives and deploying our capital and free cash flow in a balanced and disciplined manner to enhance shareholder value."

Key wins during the quarter included contracts to provide contractor logistics support (CLS) for U.S. Navy and Army training aircraft, ProVision ATD personnel screening systems to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), next-generation data link communication systems to the U.S. Air Force, AVDS-1790 Series Air Cooled V-12 Turbocharged Diesel Engines and spare parts to the Israeli Ministry of Defense and support to the U.S. Army Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). L-3 was also awarded a contract to develop a new 5x5-inch color Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display for the U.S. Army's AH-64D Apache Helicopter.
Mr. Strianese continued, "Our strategy of balanced free cash flow deployment enabled us to repurchase $371 million of our common stock and pay dividends of $46 million during the quarter. Year-to-date we have returned $943 million of cash to our shareholders, including $800 million in stock repurchases."
 
Consolidated Results
For the 2011 third quarter, consolidated net sales of $3.8 billion decreased by $48 million, or 1%, as compared to the 2010 third quarter. Sales growth from the Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (CISR) and Electronic Systems segments was offset by lower sales from the Government Services and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M) segments. Acquired businesses, which are all included in the Electronics Systems segment, added $33 million to net sales in the 2011 third quarter.
Third Quarter Results of Operations:
3
(1)
Operating income for the 2011 third quarter decreased by $31 million, or 7%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) decreased by 70 basis points to 10.7% for the 2011 third quarter compared to 11.4% for the 2010 third quarter. Lower operating margins in the Government Services and Electronic Systems segments were partially offset by higher operating margins for the CISR and AM&M segments. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.
3
Net interest expense and other income decreased by $12 million for the 2011 third quarter compared to the same period last year. The decrease was due primarily to lower amortization of bond discounts and lower interest expense as a result of recent debt refinancings. The 2010 third quarter included a $5 million ($3 million after income taxes, or $0.03 per diluted share) debt retirement charge.
The effective tax rate for the 2011 third quarter decreased by 260 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to a larger portion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the 2010 third quarter and the reenactment of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit.
Net income attributable to L-3 in the 2011 third quarter decreased by $3 million, or 1%, compared to the 2010 third quarter, and diluted EPS increased 8% to $2.24 from $2.07. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2011 third quarter compared to the 2010 third quarter declined by 9% due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
For the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2011 (2011 year-to-date period), consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion decreased by $271 million, or 2%, as compared to the year-to-date period ended September 24, 2010 (2010 year-to-date period). Lower sales from the AM&M, Government Services and Electronic Systems segments were partially offset by sales growth from the CISR segment. Additional days in the 2011 year-to-date period as compared to the 2010 year-to-date period favorably impacted sales by $83 million, primarily for the Government Services and AM&M segments. Acquired businesses, which are all included in the Electronics Systems segment, contributed $147 million to net sales in the 2011 year-to-date period.
Year-to-Date Results of Operations:
3
Operating income for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $89 million, or 7%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 50 basis points to 10.8% for the 2011 year-to-date period compared to 11.3% for the 2010 year-to-date period. Lower operating margins in the CISR, Government Services and Electronic Systems segments were partially offset by higher operating margins for the AM&M segment. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.

Net interest expense and other income decreased by $19 million for the 2011 year-to-date period compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of bond discounts and lower interest expense as a result of recent debt refinancings, and both the 2011 and 2010 year-to-date periods each included an $18 million debt retirement charge.
The effective tax rate for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to: (1) $12 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the reversal of previously accrued amounts primarily related to the 2006 and 2007 U.S. Federal income tax returns, (2) a larger portion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the 2010 year-to-date period, (3) the reenactment of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit, and (4) a 2010 year-to-date period tax provision of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the unfavorable tax treatment of the U.S. Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that did not recur.
Net income attributable to L-3 in the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by 1% compared to the 2010 year-to-date period, and diluted EPS increased 8% to $6.34 from $5.89. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2011 year-to-date period compared to the 2010 year-to-date period declined by 8% due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
Funded orders for the 2011 third quarter increased to $4.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion for the 2010 third quarter. Funded backlog was $11.5 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2010.
Orders:
Net cash from operating activities for the 2011 year-to-date period was unchanged at $984 million compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Capital expenditures, net of dispositions of property, plant and equipment, were $124 million for the 2011 year-to-date period, compared to $91 million for the 2010 year-to-date period.
Cash flow:
The table below summarizes the cash returned to shareholders during the 2011 year-to-date period compared to the 2010 year-to-date period.

Reportable Segment Results
C
3
ISR
: CISR net sales for the 2011 third quarter increased by $102 million, or 13%, compared to the 2010 third quarter primarily due to increased volume and new business for networked communication systems for manned and unmanned platforms, airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and international airborne ISR platforms.
Third Quarter
3
CISR operating income for the 2011 third quarter increased by $19 million, or 23%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Operating margin increased by 90 basis points. Improved efficiencies for airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services and higher sales volume increased operating margin by 130 basis points. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable contract performance on a networked communications contract for the U.S. Navy, which reduced operating margin by 40 basis points.
3
CISR net sales for the 2011 year-to-date period increased by $166 million, or 7%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period primarily due to increased volume and new business for networked communication systems for manned and unmanned platforms, airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services to the DoD, and international airborne ISR platforms. These increases were partially offset primarily by lower sales for airborne ISR platforms to the DoD and force protection products to foreign ministries of defense.
Year-to-Date:
3
CISR operating income for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $1 million compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 90 basis points due to lower margin sales mix, unfavorable contract performance on a networked communications contract for the U.S. Navy and a $6 million loss on a contract termination recorded in the 2011 year-to-date period.
3
Government Services
: Government Services net sales for the 2011 third quarter decreased by $90 million, or 9%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. The decrease in sales was due to: (1) $40 million related to the loss of an Afghanistan Ministry of Defense (MoD) support contract and a Federal Aviation Administration Information Technology (IT) support services contract, (2) $37 million in lower linguist services and training and logistics support services for the U.S. Army as the drawdown of U.S. military forces from Iraq continues, (3) $15 million in reduced pass-through subcontractor sales related to systems and software engineering services (SSES), (4) $11 million for completed contracts primarily the SBInet program for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and (5) $11 million for IT support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command due to fewer task orders received because of more competitors on the current contract. These decreases were partially offset by $24 million in higher sales due to increased demand for intelligence and information technology support services for U.S. Government agencies.
Third Quarter
Government Services operating income for the 2011 third quarter decreased by $18 million, or 20%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Operating margin decreased by 110 basis points. Lower contract profit rates on select new business and re-competitions of existing business due to competitive price pressures and higher business development costs for the cyber security business decreased operating margin by 120 basis points. Transaction costs of $4 million for the Engility spin-off reduced operating margin by 40 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of semi-annual award fees awarded by the customer in the 2011 third quarter for select intelligence and information technology support services contracts, which increased operating margin by 50 basis points.
 
Government Services net sales for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $113 million, or 4%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Additional days in the 2011 year-to-date period as compared to the 2010 year-to-date period increased sales by approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of the additional days, sales decreased by approximately $173 million, or 6%, due to trends similar to the 2011 third quarter. Specifically, SSES subcontractor pass-through volume declined $68 million and sales were lower by $78 million due to the loss of the Afghanistan MoD support contract.
Year-to-Date:
Government Services operating income for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $33 million, or 13%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 90 basis points due to reasons similar to the 2011 third quarter.
AM&M
: AM&M net sales for the 2011 third quarter decreased by $85 million, or 12%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) $106 million from the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) contract loss in June 2010, and (2) $25 million due to lower Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) volume. These decreases were partially offset by increased CLS services primarily for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft, a new contract which was competitively won in November 2010.
Third Quarter
AM&M operating income for the 2011 third quarter increased by $7 million, or 13%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Operating margin increased by 220 basis points. The increase in operating margin was due to: (1) 120 basis points because of the sales decline on the lower margin SOFSA contract, (2) 100 basis points as a result of improved contract performance, primarily for rotary wing cabin assemblies and special mission aircraft modernizations, and (3) 40 basis points from lower costs for CLS services. These margin increases were partially offset by 40 basis points primarily due to higher costs related to JCA.
AM&M net sales for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $294 million, or 14%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Additional days in the 2011 year-to-date period as compared to the 2010 year-to-date period increased sales by $23 million. Excluding the impact of the additional days, sales decreased by $317 million, or 15%. The decrease was primarily the result of $304 million from the SOFSA contract loss and $58 million from lower JCA volume, partially offset by increased CLS services for C-12 aircraft.
Year-to-Date:
AM&M operating income for the 2011 year-to-date period increased by $12 million, or 7%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Operating margin increased by 200 basis points, of which 150 basis points was primarily due to reasons similar to the 2011 third quarter and 50 basis points due to a 2011 first quarter favorable price adjustment of $10 million for an international aircraft modernization contract.
Electronic Systems
: Electronic Systems net sales for the 2011 third quarter increased by $25 million, or 2%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Sales from acquired businesses added $33 million to net sales. Volume increases on existing contracts primarily for Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) products to the U.S. Army and new business for commercial shipbuilding products increased sales by $48 million. These increases were partially offset by lower sales primarily for: (1) warrior systems due to lower shipments of night vision products, (2) simulation & training devices due primarily to declining production volumes on the F-22, Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and F-18 programs, and (3) combat propulsion systems due primarily to lower volume for Bradley Fighting Vehicle transmissions, M-1 Abrams tank engines and spare parts.
Third Quarter
 
Electronic Systems operating income for the 2011 third quarter decreased by $39 million, or 19%, compared to the 2010 third quarter. Operating margin declined by 320 basis points due to: (1) unfavorable contract performance and lower sales primarily for warrior systems, simulation & training and combat propulsion systems, which together reduced operating margin by 250 basis points, (2) a favorable contract modification of $5 million for precision engagement in 2010 that did not recur, which reduced operating margin by 50 basis points, and (3) lower manufacturing yields for power devices for satellite communication systems, which reduced operating margin by 20 basis points.
Electronic Systems net sales for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $30 million, or 1%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period, reflecting lower sales volume for: (1) warrior systems, (2) microwave products due to reduced deliveries of mobile satellite communications systems and related power devices and amplifiers, and lower volume related to the Prophet program, (3) simulation & training devices due to declining production volumes on the F-22, AVCATT and F-18 programs and the delay of a foreign maritime simulation contract, and (4) combat propulsion systems due primarily to reduced DoD funding for Bradley Fighting Vehicles. These decreases were partially offset primarily by sales from acquired businesses of $147 million, and volume increases primarily for EO/IR.
Year-to-Date:
Electronic Systems operating income for the 2011 year-to-date period decreased by $66 million, or 11%, compared to the 2010 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 150 basis points, of which 190 basis points was primarily due to reasons similar to the 2011 third quarter. Additionally, the decrease in operating margin was partially offset by 40 basis points due primarily to increased EO/IR sales volume.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain of the matters discussed in this release, including information regarding the company's 2011 financial outlook that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, including projections of total sales growth, sales growth from business acquisitions, organic sales growth, consolidated operating margins, total segment operating margins, interest expense, earnings, cash flow, research and development costs, working capital, capital expenditures and other projections, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties, and therefore, we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved. Such statements will also be influenced by factors which include, among other things: timing and completion of the planned spin-off of a new, independent, publicly traded government services company, our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government defense budget; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed funding of the Department of Defense (DoD) budget; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of, or contractors to, the U.S. Government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding our contracts with the U.S. or foreign governments and the results of any investigation of our contracts undertaken by the U.S. or foreign governments; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts (revenue arrangements); our ability to successfully compete for and win new business and related contracts (revenue arrangements) and to win re-competitions of our existing contracts; our ability to identify and acquire additional businesses in the future with terms that are attractive to L-3 and to integrate acquired business operations; the impact of any strategic initiatives undertaken by us, including but not limited to the potential spin-off of a portion of our Government Services segment, and our ability to achieve anticipated benefits; our ability to maintain and improve our consolidated operating margin and total segment operating margin in future periods; our ability to obtain future government contracts (revenue arrangements) on a timely basis; the availability of government funding or cost-cutting initiatives and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements; our ability to continue to retain and
 
train our existing employees and to recruit and hire new qualified and skilled employees as well as our ability to retain and hire employees with U.S. Government security clearances; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining agreements, our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate, including those for the commercial aviation, shipbuilding and communications markets; global economic uncertainty; the DoD's contractor support services in-sourcing and efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts (revenue arrangements) on schedule; our international operations; our extensive use of fixed-price type contracts as compared to cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in the defense industry and the commercial industries in which our businesses participate; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; the outcome of litigation matters, including in connection with jury trials; results of audits by U.S. Government agencies; results of on-going governmental investigations, including potential suspensions or debarments; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; anticipated cost savings from business acquisitions not fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; the outcome of matters relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar non-U.S. regulations; ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations; competitive pressure among companies in our industry; and the fair values of our assets, which can be impaired or reduced by other factors, some of which are discussed above.
For a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see "Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors" and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on for the year ended December 31, 2010, as well as any material updates to these factors in our future filings.

Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this release to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
