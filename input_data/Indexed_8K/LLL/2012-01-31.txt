NEW YORK, January 31, 2012  L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) of $2.72 for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 (2011 fourth quarter), including a $0.28 net gain for certain items and a $0.10 debt retirement charge that are discussed below. Excluding these items, diluted EPS increased 7% to $2.54, compared to $2.37 for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 (2010 fourth quarter). Net sales decreased by approximately 6% to $4.0 billion, compared to $4.3 billion for the 2010 fourth quarter. Net cash from operating activities was $500 million for the 2011 fourth quarter, compared to $477 million for the 2010 fourth quarter.
"Overall, we had a solid fourth quarter, underscored by strong cash flow and EPS. Sales performance reflected our areas of competitive strength as well as a challenging defense budget environment which is creating headwinds in the AM&M, Government Services and Electronic Systems segments. C

ISR sales grew by 8%, and sales were also solid in contractor logistics support services within AM&M due to recent competitive wins. Also, volume increased for EO/IR products within Electronic Systems. We ended the quarter with funded backlog of $10.7 billion," said Michael T. Strianese, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, our focus will be on strengthening the company by continuing our outstanding program performance and improving operational efficiencies, while investing in R&D to provide affordable solutions that address customer imperatives positioned in budget priority areas. Our spin-off of the Engility businesses will strengthen both L-3 and Engility, improve L-3's growth and margin profile, and remains on schedule to be completed by mid-year. We will also continue to focus on adding new capabilities that expand our product lines and customer base, as with the pending acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical."
Key wins for the quarter included the U.S. Air Force's F-16 Training System program, as well as continued strong orders for Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) products, Rover 6, and satellite communications products and services.
Mr. Strianese continued, "Consistent with our strategy of deploying capital and free cash flow to enhance shareholder value, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock and paid dividends of $45 million during the quarter. For 2011, total share repurchases were $958 million and total dividends paid increased to $188 million, a 13% increase in total cash returned to shareholders compared to 2010."

ISR) segment was offset by lower sales from the Government Services, Electronic Systems, and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M) segments. Fewer days in the 2011 fourth quarter as compared to the 2010 fourth quarter unfavorably impacted sales by $83 million, primarily for the Government Services and AM&M segments. Acquired businesses(1), which are all included in the Electronics Systems segment, added $13 million to net sales in the 2011 fourth quarter.
Consolidated operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $63 million compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. The goodwill impairment charge decreased consolidated operating income by $43 million.

Segment operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $20 million, or 4%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Segment operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) increased by 20 basis points to 11.0% for the 2011 fourth quarter compared to 10.8% for the 2010 fourth quarter. Higher operating margins in the C

ISR and Electronic Systems segments were partially offset by lower operating margins for the Government Services and AM&M segments. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.
Net interest expense and other income increased by $6 million for the 2011 fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to $14 million for the company's share of an impairment charge for long-lived assets at an equity method investment, partially offset by lower amortization of bond discounts.
During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company recorded a debt retirement charge of $17 million ($10 million after income tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) related to the redemption of $500 million of the company's outstanding $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6

% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the "Redemption Charge"). The redemption was financed with proceeds from the $500 million of 3.95% senior notes due November 15, 2016, which were issued on November 22, 2011, and cash on hand.
The effective tax rate for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased to 11.2% from 31.7% for the same period last year. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, the effective tax rate would have increased to 32.5% for the 2011 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to the recognition of the full year benefit for the re-enactment of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit in the 2010 fourth quarter, partially offset by a decrease related to the repatriation of foreign earnings in the 2011 fourth quarter.
Net income attributable to L-3 in the 2011 fourth quarter increased 2% to $274 million compared to the 2010 fourth quarter, and diluted EPS increased 15% to $2.72 from $2.37. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, net income attributable to L-3 decreased $22 million to $246 million and diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $2.44. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2011 fourth quarter compared to the 2010 fourth quarter declined by 11% due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
Excluding the Engility businesses, consolidated net sales would have decreased by 4% to $3,543 million for the 2011 fourth quarter from $3,671 million for the 2010 fourth quarter. Segment operating margin would have increased by 40 basis points to 11.3% for the 2011 fourth quarter from 10.9% for the 2010 fourth quarter.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated net sales of $15.2 billion decreased by $511 million, or 3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Sales growth from the C

ISR, Government Services and Electronic Systems segments were partially offset by higher operating margins for the AM&M segment. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.
Net interest expense and other income decreased by $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of bond discounts and lower interest expense as a result of recent debt refinancings, partially offset by $14 million for the company's share of an impairment charge for long-lived assets at an equity method investment.
During 2011, the company redeemed its $650 million of 5

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased to 27.1% from 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, the effective tax rate would have decreased to 32.1% for 2011. This decrease was primarily due to: (1) $12 million for the reversal of previously accrued amounts in the

second quarter of 2011, (2) additional Federal tax benefits on the repatriation of foreign earnings, and (3) a 2010 tax provision of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the unfavorable tax treatment of the U.S. Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that did not recur in 2011.
Net income attributable to L-3 in the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $1 million compared to last year, and diluted EPS increased 9% to $9.03 from $8.25. Excluding the Q4 2011 Items, net income attributable to L-3 decreased $27 million to $928 million and diluted EPS increased $0.52, or 6%, to $8.77. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for 2011 compared to 2010 declined by 8% due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
Excluding the Engility businesses, consolidated net sales would have decreased by 2% to $13,141 million for 2011 from $13,374 million for 2010. Segment operating margin would have decreased by 20 basis points to 11.1% for 2011 from 11.3% for 2010.
Funded orders for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased to $3.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion for the 2010 fourth quarter and funded orders for 2011 decreased to $14.8 billion compared to $15.7 billion for 2010. Funded backlog was $10.7 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2010.
Orders:
Net cash from operating activities was $1,484 million for 2011, an increase of $23 million compared to $1,461 million for 2010. Capital expenditures, net of dispositions of property, plant and equipment, were $186 million for 2011, compared to $171 million for 2010.

Fourth Quarter
3
ISR net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter increased by $79 million, or 8%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter primarily due to increased volume for airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and new business for international airborne ISR platforms.
C
3
ISR operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter increased by $19 million, or 18%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Operating margin increased by 100 basis points primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments in the 2010 fourth quarter on a networked communications development contract for the U.S. Navy, which did not recur during the 2011 fourth quarter.
C
Full Year:
3
ISR net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $245 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily due to increased volume and new business for networked communication systems for manned and unmanned platforms, airborne ISR logistics support and fleet management services to the DoD, and international airborne ISR platforms. These increases were partially offset primarily by lower sales for airborne ISR platforms to the DoD and force protection products to foreign ministries of defense.
C
3
ISR operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $18 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating margin decreased by 30 basis points primarily due to lower margin sales mix for networked communication systems and a $6 million loss on a contract termination recorded in 2011.
Government Services
 
: Government Services net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $192 million, or 19%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Fewer days in the 2011 fourth quarter as compared to the 2010 fourth quarter decreased sales by approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of the fewer days, sales decreased by approximately $132 million. The decrease in sales was due to: (1) $57 million in lower linguist, intelligence support and logistics services for the U.S. Army due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces from Iraq, (2) $43 million primarily related to re-competition losses of an Afghanistan Ministry of Defense (MoD) support contract and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) IT support services contract (3) $23 million for Information Technology (IT) support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command due to fewer task orders received because of more competitors on the current contract, and (4) $9 million in reduced pass-through subcontractor sales related to systems and software engineering services (SSES).
Fourth Quarter
Government Services operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $28 million, or 31%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 130 basis points due to transaction costs of $5 million for the Engility spin-off, severance charges of $2 million and higher business development costs for cyber security initiatives.
Government Services net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $305 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in sales was due to: (1) $124 million primarily related to the loss of the Afghanistan MoD support contract and the FAA IT support services contract, (2) $118 million in lower linguist services, training, intelligence support, and logistics support services for the U.S. Army due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces from Iraq, (3) $75 million in reduced SSES pass-through volume, (4) $51 million of lower sales related to the SBInet program for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and an international maritime security enhancement program, and (5) $42 million for IT support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command due to fewer task orders received because of more competitors on the current contract. These decreases were partially offset by $105 million in higher sales due to increased demand for intelligence and information technology support services for U.S. Government agencies.
Full Year:
 
L-3 Announces Results for the 2011 Fourth Quarter
 
Government Services operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $62 million, or 18%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating margin decreased by 100 basis points. Lower contract profit rates on select new business and re-competitions of existing business due to competitive price pressures and higher business development costs for cyber security initiatives decreased operating margin by 60 basis points. Transaction costs of $9 million for the Engility spin-off and severance charges of $5 million reduced operating margin by 40 basis points.
AM&M
 
: AM&M net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $47 million, or 7%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Fewer days in the 2011 fourth quarter as compared to the 2010 fourth quarter decreased sales by approximately $23 million. Excluding the impact of the fewer days, sales decreased by approximately $24 million, or 4%. The decrease was primarily due to: (1) $28 million from the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) contract loss in June 2010, (2) $17 million due to lower Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) volume, and (3) $17 million due to lower sales volume for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (MHP). These decreases were partially offset by increased Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services primarily for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft, a new contract which was competitively won in November 2010.
Fourth Quarter
AM&M operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $9 million, or 16%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 80 basis points. The decrease in operating margin was due to: (1) the timing of costs for the U.S. Army C-12 aircraft contract, which reduced operating margin by 90 basis points, and (2) a $12 million charge to reduce the total JCA order quantity to 21 aircraft, which reduced operating margin by 80 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 90 basis points primarily due to improved contract performance for special mission aircraft.
AM&M net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $341 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily the result of $332 million from the SOFSA contract loss, $75 million from lower JCA volume, and $35 million due to lower sales for MHP, partially offset by increased CLS services for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft.
Full Year:
AM&M operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $3 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating margin increased by 130 basis points. The increase in operating margin was due to: (1) improved contract performance for rotary wing cabin assemblies and special mission aircraft, which increased operating margin by 100 basis points, (2) the sales decline on the lower margin SOFSA contract, which increased operating margin by 60 basis points, and (3) a 2011 first quarter favorable price adjustment of $10 million for an international aircraft modernization contract, which increased operating margin by 40 basis points. These margin increases were partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in operating margin primarily due to JCA for higher costs and reduced aircraft order quantities.
Electronic Systems
 
: Electronic Systems net sales for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $80 million, or 5%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter, reflecting lower sales of: (1) $117 million due to declining DoD demand for night vision products, display systems, navigation and telemetry products, antenna systems, combat propulsion systems, undersea warfare products and simulation & training devices, and (2) $10 million due to lower manufacturing yields for power devices for satellite communications and airborne radar systems. In addition, $9 million from the sale of a general aviation product technology license in the 2010 fourth quarter did not recur in the 2011 fourth quarter. These decreases were partially offset by sales from acquired businesses of $13 million and sales volume increases of $43 million for EO/IR products to the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force.
Fourth Quarter
 
L-3 Announces Results for the 2011 Fourth Quarter
 
Electronic Systems operating income for the 2011 fourth quarter decreased by $2 million, or 1%, compared to the 2010 fourth quarter. Operating margin increased by 50 basis points. Higher sales volume for EO/IR products, favorable sales mix for security & detection products and lower severance charges in the 2011 fourth quarter compared to the 2010 fourth quarter increased operating margin by 160 basis points. These increases in operating margin were partially offset by a decrease of 110 basis points due primarily to lower sales for night vision products and the sale of a technology license in the 2010 fourth quarter that did not recur in the 2011 fourth quarter.
Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $110 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting lower sales of: (1) $376 million due to declining DoD demand for night vision products, combat propulsion systems, mobile satellite communication systems and simulation & training devices, (2) $40 million due to lower manufacturing yields for power devices for satellite communications systems, and (3) $9 million from the sale of a general aviation product technology license in the 2010 fourth quarter that did not recur in the 2011 fourth quarter. These decreases were partially offset by sales from acquired businesses of $160 million, sales volume increases of $122 million for EO/IR products to the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, and higher sales for commercial shipbuilding products of $33 million, with a majority of the increases due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.
Full Year:
Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $68 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating margin decreased by 90 basis points. Unfavorable contract performance and lower sales primarily for warrior systems and simulation & training reduced operating margin by 150 basis points, and lower manufacturing yields for power devices for satellite communication systems reduced operating margin by 20 basis points. These decreases in operating margin were partially offset by 80 basis points due primarily to higher sales volume for EO/IR products.

Although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, including projections of total sales growth, sales growth from business acquisitions, organic sales growth, consolidated operating margins, total segment operating margins, interest expense, earnings, cash flow, research and development costs, working capital, capital expenditures and other projections, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties, and therefore, we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved. Such statements will also be influenced by factors which include, among other things: timing and completion of the planned spin-off of a new, independent, publicly traded government services company, our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government defense budget; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed funding of the Department of Defense (DoD) budget; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of, or contractors to, the U.S. Government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding our contracts with the U.S. or foreign governments and the results of any investigation of our contracts undertaken by the U.S. or foreign governments; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts (revenue arrangements); our ability to successfully compete for and win new business and related contracts (revenue arrangements) and to win re-competitions of our existing contracts; our ability to identify and acquire additional businesses in the future with terms that are attractive to L-3 and to integrate acquired business operations; the impact of any strategic initiatives undertaken by us, including but not limited to the potential spin-off of a portion of our Government Services segment, and our ability to achieve anticipated benefits; our ability to maintain and improve our consolidated operating margin and total segment operating margin in future periods; our ability to obtain future government contracts (revenue arrangements) on a timely basis; the availability of government funding or cost-cutting initiatives and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements; our ability to continue to retain and train our existing employees and to recruit and hire new qualified and skilled employees

For a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see "Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors" and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and "Part II  Item A  Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, as well as any material updates to these factors in our future filings.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this release to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
