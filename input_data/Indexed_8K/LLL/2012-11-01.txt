Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, November 1, 2012  L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) from continuing operations of $1.98 for the quarter ended September 28, 2012 (2012 third quarter), compared to $2.02 for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 (2011 third quarter). The 2012 third quarter included a tax benefit of $0.11 per diluted share that is discussed below. Net sales of $3.3 billion for the 2012 third quarter decreased by 0.5% compared to the 2011 third quarter.
On July 17, 2012, L-3 completed the previously announced spin-off of its subsidiary, Engility Holdings, Inc. (Engility). The spin-off was a tax-free distribution to L-3 shareholders for U.S. federal tax purposes in which L-3 shareholders of record on July 16, 2012 (the record date) received one share of Engility common stock for every six shares of L-3 common stock held on the record date. In connection with the spin-off, Engility made a cash distribution of $335 million to L-3. L-3 used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $250 million of its 6

% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (2015 Notes) on July 26, 2012. L-3 intends to use the remaining proceeds primarily to repurchase additional outstanding shares of its common stock. L-3's results present Engility as a discontinued operation.
"Overall, we had a solid third quarter and performed well in our core areas and we continued to make progress in our international and commercial businesses. In spite of the challenges and uncertainty in the U.S. defense budget, sales grew in our Electronic Systems, C

ISR and AM&M segments, which demonstrates that L-3 is well-positioned and executing on its strategy to grow market share and be adaptable and agile in the markets we serve," said Michael T. Strianese, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Orders for the quarter were $3.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99x. We ended the quarter with funded backlog of $11.0 billion, up 11% compared to December 2011."
"We remain focused on delivering innovation to our customers and value to all of our stakeholders. We are proactively reducing our operating costs and rightsizing our business units, while also investing in research and development. We continue to deploy our capital using a disciplined and balanced approach, with cash, cash dividends and share buybacks, modest debt reduction, plus acquisitions that expand our market share and strengthen our businesses. On August 7, 2012, we acquired the commercial aircraft simulation business from Thales Group, which extends our simulation and training business into the global commercial marketplace and also provides us a full-motion simulator capability. Going forward, this strategy will continue to serve L-3 well."
Key contract wins for the quarter included: (1) continued operations and sustainment for the U.S. Army Constant Hawk aircraft, (2) an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contract to supply VideoScout products and related upgrades to the Marine Corps, (3) communications systems for NASA's Common Communications for Visiting Vehicles (C2V2) program, and (4) an ID/IQ contract to supply medium-speed explosives detection and ProVision ATD (Automatic Target Detection) advanced imaging technology systems to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
 
 
Mr. Strianese continued, "We remain committed to shareholder value, deploying capital and free cash flow to enhance our operations and return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $189 million of our common stock and paid dividends of $51 million, resulting in $653 million of cash returned to our shareholders year-to-date."

, which are all included in the Electronic Systems segment, added $63 million to net sales in the 2012 third quarter. Net sales to commercial and foreign government end customers grew 19% to $808 million for the 2012 third quarter compared to $679 million for the 2011 third quarter.
Operating income for the 2012 third quarter decreased by $28 million compared to the 2011 third quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) decreased by 80 basis points to 10.1% for the 2012 third quarter compared to 10.9% for the 2011 third quarter. Higher pension expense of $15 million ($9 million after income tax, or $0.09 per diluted share) reduced operating margin by 40 basis points. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.
Net interest expense and other income increased by $1 million for the 2012 third quarter compared to the same period last year. The 2012 third quarter includes a $3 million ($2 million after income tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) non-cash asset impairment charge related to the planned dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture. Interest expense declined by $2 million due to lower interest rates on outstanding fixed rate debt.
During the 2012 third quarter, the company recorded a debt retirement charge of $8 million ($5 million after income tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) related to the redemption of $250 million of the 2015 Notes.
The effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter decreased by 230 basis points compared to the same period last year. The effective tax rate decreased by 390 basis points due to a tax benefit of $11 million, primarily related to the reversal of amounts previously accrued for tax years in which the statute of limitations had expired, partially offset by the expiration of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit on December 31, 2011.
Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the 2012 third quarter decreased 9% to $193 million compared to the 2011 third quarter, and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 2% to $1.98 from $2.02. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2012 third quarter declined by 7% compared to the 2011 third quarter due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
 
 
For the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2012 (2012 year-to-date period) consolidated net sales decreased by $29 million compared to the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2011 (2011 year-to-date period). Higher sales from the C

ISR and AM&M segments were offset by lower sales from the NSS and Electronic Systems segments. Acquired businesses, which are all included in the Electronic Systems segment, added $130 million to net sales in the 2012 year-to-date period. Net sales to commercial and foreign government end customers grew 12% to $2,223 million for the 2012 year-to-date period compared to $1,992 million for the 2011 year-to-date period.
Operating income for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $58 million compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 10.3% for the 2012 year-to-date period compared to 10.9% for the 2011 year-to-date period. Higher pension expense of $28 million ($17 million after income tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) reduced operating margin by 30 basis points. See segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin.
Net interest expense and other income decreased by $10 million for the 2012 year-to-date period compared to the same period last year. Lower interest expense of $13 million on outstanding fixed rate debt was partially offset by the $3 million non-cash asset impairment charge, recorded in the 2012 third quarter, related to the planned dissolution of an unconsolidated joint venture.
The company recorded debt retirement charges of $8 million ($5 million after income tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) during the 2012 year-to-date period and $18 million ($11 million after income tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) during the 2011 year-to-date period as a result of debt redemptions and refinancings.
The effective tax rate for the 2012 year-to-date period increased by 120 basis points compared to the same period last year primarily due to the expiration of the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credit on December 31, 2011. The 2012 and 2011 year-to-date periods included tax benefits of $11 million and $12 million, respectively, primarily related to the reversal of amounts previously accrued for prior tax years.
Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the 2012 year-to-date period decreased 6% to $570 million compared to the 2011 year-to-date period, and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 3% to $5.78 from $5.62. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2012 year-to-date period declined by 8% compared to the 2011 year-to-date period due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.
Funded orders for the 2012 year-to-date period increased 4% to $10.5 billion compared to $10.0 billion for the 2011 year-to-date period. Funded backlog grew 11% to $11.0 billion at September 28, 2012, compared to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2011.
Orders:
Net cash from operating activities was $692 million for the 2012 year-to-date period, a decrease of $57 million, compared to $749 million for the 2011 year-to-date period. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to the decline in income from continuing operations and higher income tax payments, partially offset by lower interest payments. Capital expenditures, net of dispositions of property, plant and equipment, were $118 million for the 2012 year-to-date period, compared to $119 million for the 2011 year-to-date period.
Cash flow:

Reportable Segment Results
Electronic Systems
 
Electronic Systems net sales for the 2012 third quarter increased by $9 million, or 1%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Sales increased for: (1) Microwave Products by $35 million primarily for increased deliveries of mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military and power devices for commercial satellite communication systems, (2) Sensor Systems by $30 million primarily from the Kollmorgen Electro-Optical (KEO) acquisition, which was completed in February 2012, and (3) Simulation & Training by $20 million primarily due to the commercial aircraft simulation business acquired from Thales Group, which was completed in August 2012 and named Link Simulation & Training U.K., Limited (Link U.K.). These increases were partially offset by a sales decrease of $63 million for Marine & Power Systems due to lower demand primarily for commercial shipbuilding products, which reduced sales by $37 million (including $15 million of negative foreign currency translation), and reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army, which reduced sales by $26 million. Also, sales declined by $13 million for Precision Engagement due to lower volume from contracts nearing completion during the quarter and lower demand.
Third Quarter:
Electronic Systems operating income for the 2012 third quarter decreased by $8 million, or 5%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 11.3%. Sales mix changes reduced operating margin by 40 basis points and higher pension expense of $4 million reduced operation margin by 30 basis points.
Electronic Systems net sales for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $13 million, or 0.3%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Sales declined for: (1) Marine & Power Systems by $105 million primarily due to reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army, which reduced sales by $72 million, and $33 million of negative foreign currency translation, (2) Warrior Systems by $68 million for night vision and illumination products due to reduced U.S. Army requirements, (3) Precision Engagement by $65 million due to contracts nearing completion and lower demand. These declines were partially offset by sales increases of: (1) $135 million for Sensor Systems, comprised of $100 million from the KEO acquisition and $35 million primarily for higher sales of airborne EO/IR turrets for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), (2) $66 million primarily for Microwave Products due to reasons similar to the 2012 third quarter, and (3) $24 million for the Link U.K. acquisition.
Year-to-Date:
Electronic Systems operating income for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $23 million, or 5%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 11.8%. Sales mix changes reduced operating margin by 80 basis points and higher pension expense of $4 million reduced operating margin by 10 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved contract performance, primarily for Displays, Warrior Systems and Precision Engagement, which increased operating margin by 30 basis points.

ISR net sales for the 2012 third quarter increased by $11 million, or 1%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Sales for ISR Systems increased by $49 million primarily due to higher volume for airborne ISR systems. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of $38 million for networked communication systems primarily from fewer deliveries of remote video terminals and lower volume on the Hawklink contract due to development and low rate initial production work nearing completion.

ISR operating income for the 2012 third quarter decreased by $7 million, or 7%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Operating margin decreased by 90 basis points to 10.5%. Higher pension expense of $10 million reduced operating margin by 110 basis points and sales mix changes reduced operating margin by 40 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved contract performance, which increased operating margin by 60 basis points.

ISR net sales for the 2012 year-to-date period increased by $167 million, or 7%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Sales for ISR Systems increased by $144 million primarily due to higher volume on airborne ISR systems and increased demand for logistic support and fleet management services. Sales also increased by $23 million primarily for networked communication systems due to higher volume for manned and unmanned platforms for DoD customers.

ISR operating income for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $13 million, or 5%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 120 basis points to 10.3%. Higher pension expense of $19 million reduced operating margin by 70 basis points and sales mix changes reduced operating margin by 80 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by improved contract performance, which increased operating margin by 30 basis points.
AM&M
 
AM&M net sales for the 2012 third quarter increased by $26 million, or 4%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Platform systems sales increased by $99 million, partially offset by a decline of $73 million for logistics support services. The platform systems increase was due primarily to volume on new contracts, including the Australia C-27J and international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, and increased scope on the EC-130 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Logistics support services decreased due primarily to the competitive loss of a task order for U.S. Army contract field team support services in Southwest Asia.
Third Quarter:
AM&M operating income for the 2012 third quarter increased by $5 million, or 8%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 10.0%. Operating margin increased by 100 basis points due to lower costs related to the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA). This increase was partially offset by 50 basis points primarily due to sales mix changes and 20 basis points due to higher pension expense of $1 million.
AM&M net sales for the 2012 year-to-date period increased by $29 million, or 2%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Platform systems sales increased by $78 million, which was partially offset by a decline of $49 million for logistic support services. The platform systems increase was due primarily to volume on new contracts, including the Australia C-27J and international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, and increased scope on the EC-130 aircraft for the USAF. These increases were partially offset by lower JCA volume for the USAF. Logistics support services decreased due primarily to the loss of a task order for U.S. Army contract field team support services in Southwest Asia, partially offset by increased demand for field maintenance and sustainment services on a U.S. Army rotary wing aircraft contract that was competitively won in September 2011 and for U.S. Army C-12 aircraft.
Year-to-Date:
 
AM&M operating income for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $2 million, or 0.9%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 9.6%. The decrease in operating margin was due to a $6 million, or 30 basis points, net favorable adjustment in the 2011 year-to-date period, comprised of a favorable price adjustment for an international modification contract, partially offset by start-up costs for the U.S. Army C-12 aircraft maintenance contract. Pension expense increased by $5 million, which reduced operating margin by 30 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by 30 basis points primarily due to lower costs related to JCA.
NSS
 
NSS net sales for the 2012 third quarter decreased by $65 million, or 16%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Less demand for U.S. Special Operations Command information technology (IT) support services, due to our previous single-award contract converting to several multiple-award contracts which reduced our workshare, lowered sales by $27 million. A decline in IT support services for select non-DoD U.S. Government agencies due to customer IT spending reductions and competitive contract losses in 2011 lowered sales by $25 million. Sales declined by $13 million for intelligence support services due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq.
Third Quarter:
NSS operating income for the 2012 third quarter decreased by $18 million, or 55%, compared to the 2011 third quarter. Operating margin decreased by 370 basis points to 4.1%, primarily due to: (1) lower contract profit rates on re-competitions of existing business and lower sales volume, which reduced operating margin by 200 basis points, (2) a $4 million inventory write-down for security and safety equipment, which reduced operating margin by 110 basis points, and (3) legal fees of $2 million related to a supplier dispute, which reduced operating margin by 60 basis points.
NSS net sales for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $213 million, or 17%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. The decrease was primarily due to trends similar to the 2012 third quarter. Specifically, lower volumes for IT support services reduced sales by $84 million, less U.S. Special Operations Command IT support services lowered sales by $81 million, and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq lowered sales by $48 million.
Year-to-Date:
NSS operating income for the 2012 year-to-date period decreased by $20 million, or 26%, compared to the 2011 year-to-date period. Operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 5.4%. Lower sales volume and lower contract profit rates on re-competitions of existing business decreased operating margins by 40 basis points, a $4 million inventory write-down for security and safety equipment reduced operating margin by 40 basis points, and legal fees of $3 million related to a supplier dispute reduced operating margins by 30 basis points. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of award fees for acquisition management and IT support services, which increased operating margin by 40 basis points.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain of the matters discussed in this release, including information regarding the company's 2012 financial outlook that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, including projections of total sales growth, sales growth from business acquisitions, organic sales growth, consolidated operating margins, total segment operating margins, interest expense, earnings, cash flow, research and development costs, working capital, capital expenditures and other projections, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties, and therefore, we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved. Such statements will also be influenced by factors which include, among other things: our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government defense budget; backlog processing and program slips resulting from delayed funding of the Department of Defense (DoD) budget; our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of, or contractors to, the U.S. Government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform; the extensive legal and regulatory requirements surrounding our contracts with the U.S. or foreign governments and the results of any investigation of our contracts undertaken by the U.S. or foreign governments; our ability to retain our existing business and related contracts (revenue arrangements); our ability to successfully compete for and win new business and related contracts (revenue arrangements) and to win re-competitions of our existing contracts; our ability to identify and acquire additional businesses in the future with terms that are attractive to L-3 and to integrate acquired business operations; the impact of any strategic initiatives undertaken by us, and our ability to achieve anticipated benefits; our ability to maintain and improve our consolidated operating margin and total segment operating margin in future periods; our ability to obtain future government contracts (revenue arrangements) on a timely basis; the availability of government funding or cost-cutting initiatives and changes in customer requirements for our products and services; our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements; our ability to continue to retain and train our existing employees and to recruit and hire new qualified and skilled employees as well as our ability to retain and hire employees with U.S. Government security clearances; actual future interest rates, volatility and other assumptions used in the determination of pension benefits and equity based compensation, as well as the market performance of benefit plan assets; our collective bargaining agreements,
 
our ability to successfully negotiate contracts with labor unions and our ability to favorably resolve labor disputes should they arise; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate, including those for the commercial aviation, shipbuilding and communications markets; global economic uncertainty; the DoD's contractor support services in-sourcing and efficiency initiatives; events beyond our control such as acts of terrorism; our ability to perform contracts (revenue arrangements) on schedule; our international operations; our extensive use of fixed-price type contracts as compared to cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts; the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in the defense industry and the commercial industries in which our businesses participate; our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in civil and commercial products or companies; the outcome of litigation matters, including in connection with jury trials; results of audits by U.S. Government agencies; results of on-going governmental investigations, including potential suspensions or debarments; the impact on our business of improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners; anticipated cost savings from business acquisitions not fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; the outcome of matters relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar non-U.S. regulations; ultimate resolution of contingent matters, claims and investigations relating to acquired businesses, and the impact on the final purchase price allocations; competitive pressure among companies in our industry; and the fair values of our assets, which can be impaired or reduced by other factors, some of which are discussed above.
For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could impair our results of operations or financial condition, see "Part I  Item 1A  Risk Factors" and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, "Part I  Item 2  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview and Outlook  Industry Considerations," included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 29, 2012 and March 30, 2012, and any material updates to these factors contained in any of our future filings.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. As for the forward-looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to these forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this release to reflect events or changes in circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events.
