Contact: Paul Coghlan 6:30 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 15, 2003 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS IMPROVED SALES AND PROFITS BOTH OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, April 15, 2003, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its third quarter ended March 30, 2003, were $153,750,000, an increase of 18% over net sales of $130,155,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $60,622,000 or $0.19 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 18% from $51,480,000 or $0.16 diluted earnings per share reported for the third quarter of last year. The Company is increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.05 to $0.06 per share. The payment will be on May 14, 2003 to stockholders of record on April 25, 2003. For the quarter the Company generated approximately $16 million in additional cash and short-term investments, net of spending approximately $39 million to purchase 1,500,000 shares of its common stock. During the quarter, the Company entered into a patent portfolio cross licensing and royalty agreement with Texas Instruments, Inc. for a 10 year period, which terminates existing litigation. The amortization expense for the royalty to be incurred is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "This was a good quarter for us as we grew sales 6% and profits 8% over the previous quarter. We continue to be strongly profitable as demonstrated by our 39% return on sales. We focus our efforts on unique high-performance analog intensive, market opportunities often in the newest generation end user products. This enables us to achieve good financial results during these difficult economic and geo-political times. However, accurately forecasting short-term results remains a
challenge. Nevertheless, we had good momentum in the March quarter and consequently estimate that sales and profits for the June quarter will grow sequentially in the mid to high single digits, 5% to 8%." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this news release are forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp-up of new facilities, and the timely introduction of new processes and products. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 16, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (913) 981-5508 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.
