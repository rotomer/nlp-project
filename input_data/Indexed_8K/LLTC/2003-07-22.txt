Contact: Paul Coghlan 6:30 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 22, 2003 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY INCREASE IN SALES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 22, 2003, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its fiscal year ended June 29, 2003, were $606,573,000, an increase of 18% from net sales of $512,282,000 for the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the year of $236,591,000 or $0.74 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 20% from $197,629,000 or $0.60 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2002. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended June 29, 2003 were $165,767,000, an 18% increase from net sales of $140,757,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $66,004,000 or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, compared with $55,034,000 or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 40% for the quarter and 39% for the year. A cash dividend of $0.06 per share will be paid on August 20, 2003 to stockholders of record on August 1, 2003. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $272 million for the year and $92 million for the fourth quarter before the purchase of common stock. The Company purchased 8,390,348 shares of its common stock for $230 million for the year including 1,945,000 shares for $64 million in the quarter, resulting in a net increase in cash and short-term investments of $42 million for the year and $28 million for the quarter. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Fiscal 2003 was a successful, but challenging year for Linear, as we reported solid growth in a modestly improving economic environment. We benefited from the demand for our high-performance analog solutions in many new diverse applications in wireless, high-end consumer, automotive,
security, computer, military, industrial/medical and networking. Our sales increased 18%, and operating income improved 31%. We had an increase in net income of 20%, which was impacted by a decrease in interest income due to the dramatic decrease in interest rates. Although the overall demand for our products is improving, our customers continue to be cautious in their ordering patterns. While accurately forecasting short-term results remains a challenge, we expect low single digit growth in sales and profits in the September quarter, which is in line with our normal summer quarter patterns. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainities, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, July 23, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 457-2641 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.
