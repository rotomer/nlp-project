Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, October 14, 2003 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND PROFITS OVER BOTH THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, October 14, 2003, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its first quarter ended September 28, 2003, were $174,077,000, an increase of 23% over net sales of $142,011,000 for the first quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $69,471,000 or $0.22 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 29% from $53,802,000 or $0.17 diluted earnings per share reported for the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company generated approximately $74 million in additional cash and short-term investments. A cash dividend of $0.06 per share will be paid on November 12, 2003 to stockholders of record on October 24, 2003. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "The September quarter was a strong summer quarter for us as we grew both sales and profits 5% sequentially over the June quarter. Demand for our products improved particularly in portable product areas such as cell phones, notebook computers and high-end portable consumer products. We continue to be both strongly profitable, as demonstrated by our 40% return on sales, and strongly cash flow positive from operations, as evidenced by the increase in cash. Looking forward, the overall demand for our products is improving in all geographic markets with international business being the strongest. Consequently, should these trends continue, we expect similar percentage growth sequentially in sales and profits in the December quarter."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003.
