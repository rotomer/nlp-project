Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EST Vice President, Finance Monday, February 9, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN MARCH QUARTER GUIDANCE Milpitas, California, February 9, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that the strong demand for its products that the Company discussed in connection with its announcement of its December quarter results has accelerated during the March quarter. Consequently, should these current trends continue, the Company expects to grow both sales and profits in the March quarter approximately 10% sequentially from the December quarter. This is an increase over the 7% to 8% sequential growth guidance previously given. The foregoing statements regarding demand for the Company's products and anticipated growth for the March quarter are forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as world economic conditions, new orders received and shipped during the quarter, the continuing availability of existing operating facilities and the absence of any unexpected significant changes in operating expenses. The Company refers investors to its public disclosures including the risk factor disclosure continued therein, pertaining to its recently concluded December quarter. A press release was issued on January 13, 2004. A conference call was webcasted on January 14, 2004. An archive of the webcast is available at www.linear.com and www.streetevents.com.
