Contact: Paul Coghlan 6:30 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 13, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SALES AND PROFITS OVER BOTH THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, April 13, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its third quarter ended March 28, 2004, were $209,133,000, an increase of 36% over net sales of $153,750,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $85,549,000 or $0.27 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 41% from $60,622,000 or $0.19 diluted earnings per share reported for the third quarter of last year. During the quarter the Company's cash and short-term investments decreased by $38.4 million, net of spending $121.2 million to purchase 2,950,000 shares of its common stock. A cash dividend of $0.08 per share will be paid on May 12, 2004 to stockholders of record on April 23, 2004. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "This was another strong quarter for us. Sales grew 12% and profits 15% sequentially over the December quarter. Demand for our products has continued to be robust, increasing in each major end-market, led by industrial and communications, and increasing also in every major geographical area. Our return on sales was 41%. We generated approximately $83 million in cash and short-term investments, before purchasing the shares of our stock referred to above. In each of the last three quarters we have accelerated our year over year sales and profit growth. Looking forward, we are experiencing very broad based strength in our market place and, should these current trends continue, we expect to grow sales by roughly a similar percentage in the June quarter to the quarter just completed."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003.
