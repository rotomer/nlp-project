Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 20, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS A STRONG YEAR WITH ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY INCREASES IN SALES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 20, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its fiscal year ended June 27, 2004, were $807,281,000, an increase of 33% over net sales of $606,573,000 for the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the year of $328,171,000 or $1.02 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 39% from $236,591,000 or $0.74 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2003. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended June 27, 2004 were $238,050,000, a 44% increase from net sales of $165,767,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $98,816,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, compared with $66,004,000 or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 50% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 42% for the quarter and 41% for the year. A cash dividend of $0.08 per share will be paid on August 18, 2004 to stockholders of record on July 30, 2004. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $395 million for the year and $135 million for the fourth quarter before the purchase of common stock. The Company purchased 8,411,200 shares of its common stock for $332 million for the year including 3,406,200 shares for $127 million in the quarter, resulting in a net increase in cash and short-term investments of $63 million for the year and $8 million for the quarter. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Fiscal 2004 was a very strong year for Linear with momentum building steadily as each of the quarters had accelerated year over year growth in sales and profits.
Accordingly, we closed the year with our strongest quarter growing sales 14% and profits 16% sequentially over the March quarter. Typically the summer quarter, which we are entering, is the quarter with the lowest sequential growth, generally low single digits. However, this year, given the broad based strength we are experiencing in our marketplace, should these current trends continue, we expect to have a seasonally strong start to our new fiscal year with sales growing roughly 5% to 7% sequentially from the quarter just completed." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets, and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, July 21, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.
