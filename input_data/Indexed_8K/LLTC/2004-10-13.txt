EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, October 12, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND PROFITS OVER BOTH THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, October 12, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its first quarter ended September 26, 2004, were $253,028,000, an increase of 45% over net sales of $174,077,000 for the first quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $103,476,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 49% from $69,471,000 or $0.22 diluted earnings per share reported for the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $48.1 million, net of spending $54.6 million to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.08 per share will be paid on November 10, 2004 to stockholders of record on October 22, 2004. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Sales grew 6% sequentially from the June quarter and we continued to be cash flow positive and strongly profitable as evidenced by our 41% return on sales. However, during the quarter bookings softened moderately. End-demand appeared to ease as shipments from both our international and domestic distributors to their end customers decreased slightly. These changes were moderate. Therefore it is difficult to conclude whether these trends reflect mostly tightening of inventory in these various channels combined with minor seasonal end-demand reductions, or whether end-demand will soften more substantially in the coming quarter. Specific to Linear Technology, we presently view this tightening as temporary. Our ending on-hand inventory at distributors is lean; cancellations are still minimal; and, lead times have remained unchanged at 4 to 6 weeks.
These are challenging times to forecast. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect continued cautiousness in the marketplace relative to inventory levels. However we expect end-demand to be relatively stable, with bookings increasing slightly over the quarter. Consequently we expect sales to be largely unchanged from the prior quarter with sequential revenues ranging from slightly down to flat." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, October 13, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.
