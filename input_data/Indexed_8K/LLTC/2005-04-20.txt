Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 19, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED QUARTERLY REVENUES AND PROFITS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR'S QUARTER. CURRENT REVENUES INCLUDE ROYALTY REVENUE OF $40 MILLION. Milpitas, California, April 19, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that total revenue for its third quarter ended April 3, 2005, was $290,734,000, an increase of 39% over revenue of $209,133,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. Included in the current quarter's revenue is royalty revenue of $40,000,000, which represents past royalties receivable under terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. Linear Technology expects to earn further royalties, dependent on sales of licensed products, quarterly from July 2005 through June 2013. Such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarter's total revenue. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $121,633,000 or $0.39 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 42% from $85,549,000 or $0.27 diluted earnings per share reported for the third quarter of last year. The current quarter net income has been reduced by various expenses related to royalty revenue. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $5.2 million, net of spending $57.8 million to purchase 1,532,770 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on May 18, 2005 to stockholders of record on April 29, 2005 According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Linear Technology completed a solid quarter, further enhanced by the settlement and license agreement. Product sales were similar to last quarter, whereas bookings improved slightly during the quarter. The Company continues to be cash flow positive and profitable as evidenced by the 42% return on sales.
The license agreement confirms the strength of our intellectual property. We continue to lead the market with high performance analog technology and innovative products. With regard to the upcoming quarter, these continue to be challenging times to forecast. Many customers are cautious given the general concerns in the macroeconomic environment. We expect end demand to be relatively stable with bookings increasing slightly over the prior quarter. Additional royalty revenue under the license agreement does not commence until the September quarter. However, we expect sequential product revenues in the June quarter to increase 2% to 3% over the quarter just ended. Consequently, we expect total revenue in the range of $255 million to $258 million." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 20, 2005 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.
