Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 26, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS A STRONG YEAR WITH ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 26, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net revenue for its fiscal year ended July 3, 2005, was $1,049,694,000, an increase of 30% over net revenue of $807,281,000 for the previous year. This revenue included $40,000,000 in royalty revenue received and previously reported in the third quarter. The Company also reported net income for the year of $433,974,000 or $1.38 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 32% from $328,171,000 or $1.02 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2004. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended July 3, 2005 were $255,811,000, a 7% increase from net sales of $238,050,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $106,047,000 or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, compared with $98,816,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, also an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 41% for both the quarter and the year. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on August 24, 2005 to stockholders of record on August 5, 2005. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $134.4 million for the year, net of spending $257.2 million to purchase 7,032,770 shares of its common stock. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $53.8 million, net of spending $90.2 million to purchase 2,500,000 shares of its common stock. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase an additional 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years. According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Fiscal 2005 was a good year for us in what was generally described as a slow growth environment, and our rate of sales growth was greater than all of our major competitors allowing us to achieve over $1 billion in revenues for the first time in the Company's history. For the June quarter our product sales grew 2% sequentially from the prior quarter, however, the March quarter also had $40,000,000 of royalty revenue, whereas there was no royalty revenue in the June quarter. The September quarter that we are entering is difficult to confidently forecast. It is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication business, yet typically shows growing strength in consumer oriented businesses, as the build period for year end holiday sales approaches. Further, while we expect our bookings to increase over the prior quarter, we enter the quarter requiring a modestly higher percentage of "turns" business, which is orders that must be both booked and shipped in the period. Consequently, we currently expect sales to be similar to the quarter just completed. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004.
