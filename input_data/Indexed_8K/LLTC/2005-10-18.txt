Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, October 18, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND PRO FORMA PROFITS OVER THE SIMILAR QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR Milpitas, California, October 18, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its first quarter ended October 2, 2005, were $256,013,000, an increase of 1% over net sales of $253,028,000 for the first quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $99,181,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, ($108,451,000 or $0.35 pro forma excluding stock based compensation as noted below) as compared to $103,476,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share reported for the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payments", which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement. Since the Company began its fiscal year this quarter, it is one of the first companies required to implement FAS123R. For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock based compensation during this quarter was $13,338,000. Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding. Consequently, pro forma earnings per share, excluding stock based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.35 for the quarter ended October 2, 2005 versus $0.33 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter. The Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $43.6 million, net of spending $64.5 million to purchase 1,656,165 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on November 16, 2005 to stockholders of record on October 28, 2005. According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sequentially sales were similar to the June quarter, however, demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio. We continue to be strongly cash flow positive and our return on sales was 39% or 42% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock based compensation accounting. Looking ahead to the December quarter, our bookings have improved, particularly in consumer related products, and consequently we expect sales to increase, roughly in the 3% to 4% range."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005.

FAS123R - Stock Based Compensation became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005. FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock based compensation particularly during this transitional period when most companies have not yet adopted the provisions of FAS123R.
