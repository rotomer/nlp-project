LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND 50% FROM $0.10 TO $0.15 PER SHARE
Milpitas, California, January 17, 2006, Linear   Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its second quarter ended January 1, 2006, were $265,146,000, an increase of 6% over net sales of $250,121,000 for the second quarter of the previous year.  The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $103,264,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, ($112,807,000 or $0.36 pro forma excluding stock based compensation as noted below) as compared to $102,818,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share reported for the second quarter of last year.  During this fiscal year, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payments," which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, includ ing stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement.  For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock based compensation during this quarter was $13,731,000.  Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding.  Consequently, pro forma diluted earnings per share, excluding stock based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.36 for the quarter ended January 1, 2006 versus $0.34 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter.  Sequentially, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $7.1 million, net of spending $56 million to purchase 1,617,557 shares of common stock.
The Company also declared a 50% increase in its dividend from $0.10 to $0.15 per share.  This cash dividend will be paid on February 15, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 27, 2006.    
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sales and profits for the December quarter increased
both year over year and sequentially from the September quarter.  Demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio.  Our return on sales was a strong 39%, or 43% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock based compensation accounting.
We continue to be cash flow positive and our confidence in our cash generating capabilities has enabled us to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 50%.
Looking ahead we expect sales growth of 5% to 6% in the March quarter over the December quarter fueled by bookings growth in industrial, communications infrastructure, networking and automotive end markets."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005.

(1) Excludes 2,010 and 1,929 shares for the three and six months ended January 1, 2006, respectively, to conform diluted outstanding shares calculated under FAS123R to diluted shares calculated under prior accounting standards.
FAS123R - Stock Based Compensation became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005.  FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement.  To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock based compensation.  This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock based compensation particula rly during this transitional period when many companies have not yet adopted the provisions of FAS123R.
