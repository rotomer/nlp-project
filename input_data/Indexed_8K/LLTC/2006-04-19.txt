Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 18, 2006 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER. Milpitas, California, April 18, 2006, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that total revenues for its third quarter ended April 2, 2006, of $278,888,000, increased 5% over second quarter total revenues of $265,146,000. The Company also reported that third quarter net income of $110,555,000, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, increased 7% over second quarter net income of $103,264,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share. Sequentially, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $74.1 million, net of spending $20.2 million to purchase 532,769 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.15 per share will be paid on May 17, 2006 to stockholders of record on April 28, 2006. On a year-over-year basis, fiscal 2006 third quarter total revenues of $278,888,000 decreased 4% from total revenues of $290,734,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. Included in last year's quarterly revenues was a royalty payment of $40,000,000, which represented past royalties under terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. Subsequent quarterly royalty payments have been immaterial to each individual quarter's total revenues. Net income for the quarter of $110,555,000 or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, ($119,742,000 or $0.38 per share pro forma excluding stock-based compensation as noted below) decreased 9% as compared to $121,633,000 or $0.39 diluted earnings per share ($126,562,000 or $0.40 per share pro forma) reported for the third quarter of last year. Net income for the third quarter of last year was also positively affected by the $40,000,000 royalty payment. During this fiscal year, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payment," which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement. For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock-based compensation during this quarter was $13,218,000. Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding. Consequently, pro forma diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.38 for the quarter ended April 2, 2006 versus $0.40 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sales and profits for the March quarter increased sequentially from the December quarter. Demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio. Our return on sales was a strong 40%, or 43% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock-based compensation accounting, and we continue to be cash flow positive. As we had anticipated, strong sales for domestic and European distributors signaled a solid improvement in our broad based industrial business. Looking ahead, we currently expect this to continue into the June quarter and we are expecting sales and profits to again increase roughly 5%." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 19, 2006 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (In thousands, except per share amounts) GAAP (unaudited)
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME (In thousands, except per share amounts) NON-GAAP (unaudited) (1) Excludes 1,958 and 1,943 shares for the three and nine months ended April 2, 2006, respectively, to conform diluted outstanding shares calculated under FAS123R to diluted shares calculated under prior accounting standards FAS123R - Share-Based Payment became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005. FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock-based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock-based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock-based compensation particularly during this transitional period when many companies are initially adopting the provisions of FAS123R.
