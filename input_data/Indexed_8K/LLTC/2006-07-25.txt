Exhibit 99.1
(1)
Excludes 2,025 and 1,929 shares for the three and twelve months ended July 2, 2006, respectively, to conform diluted outstanding shares calculated under FAS123R to diluted shares calculated under prior accounting standards
FAS123R - Share-Based Payment became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005. FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Companys earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Companys historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock based compensation particularly during this transitional period when many companies have not yet adopted the provisions of FAS123R.
