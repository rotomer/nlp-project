LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER. REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WERE SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.
 
 
Milpitas, California, July 24 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended July 1, 2007.  Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased 5.1% to $268.1 million over third quarter revenues of $255.0 million and decreased 8% or $24.8 million from $292.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36 increased $.04 a share over third quarter diluted EPS of $0.32 and decreased $.01 from $0.37 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 of $95.7 million decreased $2.8 million or 2.9% from $98.6 million reported in the third quarter and decreased $20.0 million or 17% from $115.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  In April 2007, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt.  As a result the Company had both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense reducing pre tax income by $19.5 million. The Company retired 72.2 million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and expects to retire an additional 7.7 million shares during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Consequently, the transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the increased interest expense and reduced interest income.
Revenue for the year ended July 1, 2007 was $1.083 billion, a decrease of 1.0% from revenue of $1.093 billion for the previous fiscal year.  Diluted EPS for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $.02 per share higher at $1.39 compared with $1.37 for the prior fiscal year.  Net income in accordance with GAAP for fiscal year 2007 of $411.7 million decreased $17.0 million or 4.0% from $428.7 million reported in the previous fiscal year.  Total cash dividends paid during fiscal year 2007 of $192.4 million increased $38.6 million or 25% over the prior fiscal year. A cash dividend of $0.18 per share will be paid on August 22, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2007.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 was $0.42 a $.05 per share increase over $0.37 reported from the sequential March quarter and $.01 per share increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million decreased $1.8 million from $111.7 million in the third quarter and decreased $16.0 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Fiscal year 2007 non-GAAP net income of $463.4 million decreased 1.0% or $3.5 million from non-GAAP net income of $466.9 million in the previous fiscal year. The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "The Company ended the year on a positive note with sequential quarterly revenue growth of 5.1% and sequential earnings per share growth of 12.5%.  Moreover, orders placed on the Company increased during the quarter and we had a positive book to bill ratio. In addition, we are encouraged by the financial markets positive reaction to the Companys ASR discussed above and we feel that the Company is well positioned with its new capital structure.
 
Looking forward, although the summer or September quarter is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication infrastructure businesses, this should be offset by growing strength in consumer oriented businesses. In addition, our earnings per share will have a full quarter positive impact from the accelerated share repurchase because the increase in interest expense and lower interest income will be more than offset by the decrease in outstanding shares. Currently, we expect revenues in the September quarter to increase 4% to 6% from the June quarter and to have EPS increase more in the high end of this range.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2006.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
