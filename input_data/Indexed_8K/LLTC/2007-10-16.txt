LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, October 16, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased 5.0% to $281.5 million over the previous quarter revenue of $268.1 million and decreased 3.6% or $10.6 million from $292.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 increased $0.04 per share over fourth quarter diluted EPS of $0.36 per share and increased $0.03 per share over $0.37 per share reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 of $91.5 million decreased $4.2 million or 4.4% from $95.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 largely due to an increase in net interest expense and an increase in the provision for income taxes. Net income decreased $20.9 million or 18.6% from $112.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.
 
In April 2007, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt.  As a result, the Companys first quarter results had both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense when compared to both last quarter and the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The first quarter of fiscal year 2008 had higher interest expense than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 due to the fourth quarter having two months of accrued interest versus three months in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS decreased by 37.2 million shares or 14% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Consequently, the ASR transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the increase in interest expense and lower interest income.
 
A cash dividend of $0.18 per share will be paid on November 28, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 16, 2007.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.45 a $0.03 per share increase over $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.04 per share increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  First quarter non-GAAP net income of $101.4 million decreased $8.5 million from $109.9 million in the fourth quarter and decreased $22.8 million from the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was a good September quarter for us. Revenue, EPS and cash generated from operations all increased and we had a positive book to bill ratio for the quarter. We are pleased with the results of the ASR which was partially responsible for the 11% increase in diluted EPS over the prior quarter which follows on a 12.5% sequential increase in diluted EPS in the quarter before that.
 
Looking ahead to the December quarter, growth will be impacted by the usual seasonal slowdown in our businesses.  Consequently,  we expect revenues and diluted EPS to increase in the 1% to 4% range from the September quarter just completed.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
