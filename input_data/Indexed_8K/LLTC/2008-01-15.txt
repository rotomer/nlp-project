LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.18 TO $0.21 PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, January 15, 2008, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 30, 2007.  Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased 2.6% to $288.7 million over the previous quarters revenue of $281.5 million and increased 7.8% or $20.9 million over $267.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.41 increased $0.01 per share over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and increased $0.07 per share over the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Second quarter Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income of $93.8 million increased $2.3 million or 2.5% from $91.5 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Net income decreased $11.3 million or 10.7% from $105.0 million in the second quarter of last fiscal year primarily due to the increase in net interest expense as a result of the Companys issuance of convertible debt during fiscal year 2007. During the December quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased $54.5 million net of spending $32.1 million to purchase 1.0 million shares of its common stock.
 
The Company also increased its dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.21 per share for the quarter.  This cash dividend will be paid on February 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2008.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.46 per share, a $0.01 per share increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and a $0.07 per share increase over the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Second quarter non-GAAP net income of $104.0 million increased $2.6 million over $101.4 million in the first quarter and decreased $13.8 million from the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The Company grew revenues sequentially 2.6% in the December quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter that the Company has sequentially grown revenues.  In the same time period the Company has grown EPS faster than revenues.  We are pleased with the Companys results as we have grown revenues, sustained our margins, lowered our outstanding shares by 25%, grown EPS and increased our quarterly dividend by 17%.
 
Looking ahead, given the concerns about economic difficulties particularly in the USA, March is a challenging quarter to forecast. From a Linear specific point of view, March should be a good growth quarter. We had a positive book to bill ratio in the December quarter and we would expect the March quarter to have strength in the industrial and communication end markets to more than offset the normal seasonal softness in the consumer end market. However, the overriding general economic conditions merit concern. Consequently, we presently estimate that revenues and earnings will grow 1% to 5% sequentially from the December quarter.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
