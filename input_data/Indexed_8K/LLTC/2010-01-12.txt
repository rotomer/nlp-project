Milpitas, California, January 12, 2010, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 27, 2009.  Revenue of $256.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $20.2 million or 9% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $236.1 million and increased $7.2 million or 3% over $249.2 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Net income of $75.5 million increased $14.8 million or 24% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and decreased $10.7 million or 12% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 which had a gain on the early retirement debt of $14.6 million and a lower tax rate of 20.7% compared to 24.5% this quarter.
 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.33 increased $0.06 cents per share over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and decreased $0.05 cents per share from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Diluted EPS was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.3 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on the Companys Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1), which the Company adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.   All adjustments were made retrospectively as of the April 24, 2007 issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and, therefore, all prior quarters and years have been adjusted accordingly.
 
During the December quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased by $33.0 million to $942.5 million.  The Company is increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.23 per share.  This marks the 18 consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend.

According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The Company began to recover from the global recession in the first quarter, but we continued to be relatively cautious as we entered the second quarter given the economic climate and level of uncertainty among our customers.  However, the recovery continued throughout the second quarter and we experienced stronger than expected bookings with particular strength in the industrial, communication and computer end-markets.   This allowed us to beat the high end of our second quarter revenue guidance as we grew revenues $20.2 million or 9% sequentially.  In addition, higher gross margins and tight operating expense controls resulted in a 16% increase in our operating income, thereby increasing our operating margin to 45.1% of sales, up from 42.2% last quarter.
 
Our factories continue to execute well, enabling us to maintain low lead times which allows our customers to place orders on us close to their demand requirements.  Strong second quarter bookings and a related postive book-to-bill ratio that was higher than we have experienced in the past several quarters, leads us to be optimistic as we enter our third quarter.  As a result, we are forecasting revenue growth for our third fiscal quarter in the range of 7% to 10% over our second fiscal quarter.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
