Net income was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.1 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense and $10.5 million ($0.03 per share) of non-cash loss on the early retirement of a portion of the Companys senior convertible notes.

A cash dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid on August 25, 2010 to stockholders of record on August 13, 2010.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, One year ago as we entered fiscal 2010 we were starting to recover from a global recession and there were concerns about the sustainability of the recovery.  However, our recovery from the steep decline we experienced in fiscal 2009 was surprisingly rapid as we delivered four very strong quarters of sequential growth, reaching record revenues in our fiscal third quarter and again handily beating that mark in the fourth quarter.  Our growth was broad-based across all regions and end-markets, most notably in the automotive, industrial and computer end-markets.  Our team did a tremendous job of adeptly changing course from a depressed market to one of strong growth.  We continued to closely manage expenses and our rate of profitability improved, culminati ng in operating margin of 53.1% of sales achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  We are exiting fiscal 2010 with a high degree of confidence as we believe we are in an excellent position to grow our business.
 
We had another good bookings quarter with a firmly positive book to bill ratio and orders continue to be strong at the start of the current quarter.  While some bookings strength may be due to expanding lead times industry-wide, we continue to believe that the primary catalysts for our current growth are an increase in our customer base, the commencement of new programs at existing customers and an increase in end customer demand for existing programs.  Though our first fiscal quarter is traditionally a slower growth quarter for the Company, we currently believe we can grow revenues in the 4% to 7% range sequentially for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
 Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash loss on earlyretirement of convertible senior notesThe Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates, which management sepa rates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
 
.  
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
