EXHIBIT INDEX

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME, BUT GUIDES TO GROWTH IN THE MARCH QUARTER AND RAISES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND 4% TO $0.25 PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, January 17, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended January 1, 2012. Quarterly revenues of
$294.3 million
for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $35.6 million or 11% from the previous quarter's revenue of
$329.9 million
and decreased $89.3 million or 23% from
$383.6 million
reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income of
$87.9 million
decreased $20.5 million or 19% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased $55.9 million or 39% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.38
per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $0.09 per share or 19% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined $0.24 per share or 39% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the second quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $69.8 million to $1.038 billion, net of spending
$24.8 million
to acquire Dust Networks. Acquisition costs in the second quarter pertaining to Dust Networks were $3.2 million or $0.01 per share. In addition, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.25 per share. This marks the 20th consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. At the current stock price the Company's dividend yield is approximately 3%. The cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on February 29, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 17, 2012.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was an encouraging quarter in a difficult global economic environment.  We met the mid point of our guidance and we believe that we are at an inflection point in our business.  Bookings, which started slowly, strengthened in December and continued strengthening in January.  In these challenging times we maintained strong profitability, reporting operating margins at 45% of sales.  Given the improvement in our bookings and our current outlook for the March quarter, we are estimating that we will grow quarterly revenues sequentially in the 4% to 8% range for our fiscal third quarter.  As we announced earlier, we have acquired Dust Networks, a leading provider of wireless sensor networks.  Although Dust will initially have minimal impact on our quarterly financial results, we are optimistic about growth prospects for Dust in its emerging markets and the synergies between Dust and Linear in bringing rugged, low power, wireless solutions to the industrial and other end-markets.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash charge on early retirement of convertible senior notes. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP measures exclude the special expense items related to the acquisition.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expenses, acquisition related costs and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant special expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
