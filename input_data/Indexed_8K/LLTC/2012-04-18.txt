EXHIBIT INDEX

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME AND GUIDES FOR GROWTH IN THE JUNE QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, April 17, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended
April 1, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$312.4 million
for the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2012 increased
$18.0 million
or
6.1%
over the previous quarter's revenue of
$294.3 million
and decreased
$40.8 million
or
11.6%
from
$353.2 million
reported in the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income of
$98.5 million
increased
$10.6 million
or
12%
over the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased
$43.1 million
or
30%
from the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011 which benefited from a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.42
per share in the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2012 increased
$0.04
per share or
11%
over the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined
$0.19
per share or
31%
from the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the third quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $74.3 million to $1.1 billion. A cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on May 30, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 18, 2012.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was a transitional quarter for us as we returned to growth in revenue and profit. Our bookings, which began to improve at the end of last quarter, continued strong throughout the March quarter and we had a positive book to bill ratio. Consequently, we grew revenues by 6% in-line with the mid-point of our guidance. We experienced improvements in each of our major end-markets led by industrial and automotive. Our operating margin of 45% was similar to last quarter. Our third quarter results include Dust Networks, which we acquired in late December 2011. While revenues from Dust in the quarter were not significant, Dust's operating expenses included in our consolidated results had a minor negative impact on operating margins and net income.
Given the improvement in our bookings and the broad distribution of this strength across all our major end-markets, we are estimating that we will again grow quarterly revenues sequentially in the 4% to 8% range in our fourth fiscal quarter. We also expect operating income and operating margin to improve.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash charge on early retirement of convertible senior notes. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP measures exclude the special expense items related to the acquisition.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expenses, acquisition related costs and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant special expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
