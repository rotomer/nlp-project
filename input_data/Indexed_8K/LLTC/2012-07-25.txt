According to Lothar Maier, CEO, Our fourth quarter financial results were in the mid range of our guidance as sales grew 6% compared to the preceding third quarter and both gross margin and operating margin improved as a percent of sales.  This was also our fiscal year-end.  In a challenging global economic environment we improved as the year progressed growing sequentially 6% in each of the last two quarters.  Automotive was our best performing end-market, growing bookings 24% year over year.  Our largest end-market is industrial, which was 40% of our business.  Over the last three years industrial and automotive have been the fastest growing analog end-markets and we have grown these end-markets at a faster rate than the industry overall.
As we turn our focus to fiscal 2013, general economic sluggishness remains in the U.S. and we are particularly cautious about the European market and its sovereign debt issues.  Historically, the first fiscal quarter is a seasonally weak period in that region and this could be exacerbated by the continuing debt crisis.  We are hopeful that the strength we are seeing in Japan and Asia will continue to offset weakness in Europe and flatness in the USA.  Given the current environment and the level of bookings we have received over the past quarter, we are currently forecasting our revenues to be flat to up 3% over our just completed fourth fiscal quarter, generally in line with our historical seasonality for summer quarters.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2012.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and acquisition related costs.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
