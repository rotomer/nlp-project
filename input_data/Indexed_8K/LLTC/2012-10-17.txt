EXHIBIT INDEX

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY MODEST INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME.
Milpitas, California, October 16, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$335.1 million
for the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased $5.1 million or 1.6% over the previous quarter's revenue of
$330.0 million
and increased
$5.2 million
or
1.6%
over
$329.9 million
reported in the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Net income of
$105.2 million
increased
$1.9 million
or
2%
over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased
$3.2 million
or
3%
from the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.45
per share in the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased
$0.01
per share or
2%
over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined
$0.02
per share or
4%
from the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012.
During the first quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by
$116.9 million
to
$1.3 billion
. A cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on November 28, 2012 to stockholders of record on November 16, 2012. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase, depending on market conditions, up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We met the midpoint of our revenue guidance for our first fiscal quarter of 2013, as sales grew 1.6% compared to the preceding fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, net income improved and operating income as a percent of sales improved to 46.3%. Though we are pleased with these results, external global market conditions have continued to weaken. While the automotive market continues to show strength on higher bookings, this increase was offset by lower bookings in our other major markets, particularly the industrial and computer markets. Forecasting continues to be difficult in the current environment. Though customer inventory levels appear to be at reasonable levels, demand continues to be sluggish and orders have not shown signs of improvement as we begin the second quarter. Given this weakness, we expect that this will be a difficult quarter as we remain cautious about the economy and the global market. As a result, we currently are forecasting our revenues to decline sequentially in the 5% - 10% range in our second fiscal quarter of 2013.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2012.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, October 17, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash charge on early retirement of convertible senior notes. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP measures exclude the special expense items related to the acquisition.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expenses, acquisition related costs and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant special expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
