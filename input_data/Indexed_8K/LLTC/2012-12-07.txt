Exhibit 99.1
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND ACCELERATES PAYMENT OF THE CURRENT QUARTER'S DIVIDEND

Today the Board of Directors of Linear Technology Corporation approved an increase in the Company's quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.26 per share. This marks the 21
st
