Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 20, 2005, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and nine month period ended September 30, 2005, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods and a consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2005. In addition, on the same day we are holding a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference will be web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as
Exhibit 99.
We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. Non-GAAP financial measures differ from financial statements reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We use non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 with the same periods of 2004. Those measures include operating income, net income, and earnings per share ("EPS") adjusted for the following items:
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99, we also provided financial expectations for the fourth quarter and full year 2005. In addition to providing EPS expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided EPS growth comparisons on an adjusted basis. In order to provide a more meaningful EPS growth comparison between 2004 results and projected 2005 results, we made the following adjustments to 2004 and 2005 earnings per share:
Table of Contents
We excluded the effect of the items listed above. The items that are excluded are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period.
In addition, in light of our decision to adopt the new equity compensation accounting standard in January 2005, we provided adjusted proforma earnings per share for 2004 that assumes we had adopted the new standard in 2004. Given this change in accounting principle, we believe that adjusting 2004 as if we had applied the new accounting rules in that period will help investors to understand year-over-year comparisons.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that could otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain matters, like those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press released attached as Exhibit 99 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2005.
Third-Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
Pharmaceutical Product Sales Highlights
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
"We are pleased that the products in our pipeline continue to progress through development, while at the same time our newer products grow as a percentage of our total sales," said Sidney Taurel, Lilly chairman and chief executive officer. "These achievements reinforce the continued strength of our product portfolio and position us well to continue to lead the industry in innovative new treatments. As we expected, the second half of 2005 is bringing stronger sales and earnings growth as we continue to improve productivity and deliver on the promise of our portfolio."
Third-Quarter Results
Worldwide sales for the quarter were $3.601 billion, an increase of 10 percent compared with the third quarter of 2004. Worldwide sales volume increased 7 percent, selling prices increased sales 2 percent and exchange rates increased sales by 1 percent.
Gross margins as a percent of sales increased by 1.2 percentage points, to 76.5 percent. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and favorable product mix, partially offset by continued investment in the company's manufacturing capacity.
Overall, marketing and administrative expenses increased 13 percent, to $1.071 billion. This increase was primarily due to reimbursement in 2004 from collaboration partners for marketing and selling expenses incurred related to the Cymbalta launch, the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. Research and development expenses were $751.0 million, or 21 percent of sales. Compared with the third quarter of 2004, research and development expenses increased 15 percent. This increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, increased clinical trial and development expenses, and the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005.
 
 
 
Other income of $85.0 million decreased primarily due to less income related to the outlicense of legacy products outside the U.S. and to third-quarter 2004 milestones from collaborations on the duloxetine molecule, partially offset by other miscellaneous income and by the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture becoming profitable.
Net income and earnings per share for the third quarter increased 5 percent and 6 percent, to $794.4 million and $.73, respectively. Assuming stock option expensing, which commenced January 1, 2005, had been adopted in 2004, third-quarter 2005 net income and earnings per share would have increased 14 percent, compared with the recalculated third-quarter 2004 net income of $694.9 million and $.64 per share.
Zyprexa
In the third quarter of 2005, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.035 billion, a 1 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Zyprexa decreased 10 percent, to $503.9 million, due to lower underlying demand, partially offset by wholesaler de-stocking in the third quarter of 2004. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 14 percent, to $531.2 million, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased 12 percent in the third quarter.
Lilly continues to expect a slight decline in its 2005 worldwide Zyprexa sales.
Diabetes Care Products
In the third quarter of 2005, diabetes care revenue, composed primarily of Humalog, Humulin, and Actos, increased 13 percent, to $652.8 million, compared with the third quarter of 2004. Diabetes care revenue increased 14 percent in the U.S., to $359.0 million, driven by higher prices, offset partially by decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market. Diabetes care revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $293.7 million.
For the third quarter of 2005, worldwide Humalog sales were $306.2 million, an increase of 16 percent. Worldwide Humulin sales increased 3 percent, to $250.9 million. Actos generated $64.3 million of revenue for Lilly, an increase of 10 percent. As previously disclosed, since
 
 
 
Lilly's share of revenue from the agreement with Takeda will vary quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms, Actos revenue will not necessarily track with product sales. As a result, it is difficult to make quarterly comparisons for Actos revenue.
Gemzar
Gemzar had sales totaling $334.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 7 percent from the third quarter of 2004. While underlying demand increased in the U.S., variation in wholesaler buying patterns in both years caused Gemzar sales in the U.S. to decrease 2 percent to $149.7 million. Sales outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, to $184.6 million.
Evista
Evista sales were $260.3 million, a 6 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Evista decreased 5 percent, to $161.3 million. Sales outside the United States increased 29 percent, to $99.0 million.
Animal Health
Worldwide sales of animal health products in the third quarter were $215.7 million, an increase of 16 percent compared with the third quarter of 2004 due to strong growth in both the U.S. and overseas.
Newer Products
Cymbalta
For the third quarter of 2005, Cymbalta, indicated for treatment of major depressive disorder as well as diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generated $182.8 million in sales, up by 13 percent when sequentially compared with second-quarter 2005 sales of $161.4 million.
Strattera
During the third quarter of 2005, Strattera, the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults, generated $140.9 million of sales, a 14 percent decrease compared with the third quarter of 2004. The sales decrease was due to a decline in underlying demand.
 
 
 
Alimta
For the third quarter of 2005, Alimta, a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, generated sales of $122.3 million, representing a sequential increase of 10 percent compared with second-quarter 2005 sales of $111.2 million. In the third quarter, U.S. sales of Alimta were $76.9 million and sales outside the U.S. were $45.4 million.
Forteo
Third-quarter sales of Forteo, a treatment for severe osteoporosis, were $102.6 million, a 77 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Forteo increased 48 percent, to $70.4 million due to an increase in underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $32.2 million.
Xigris
Sales of Xigris, the first available pharmaceutical treatment for severe sepsis, were $45.5 million, a decrease of 8 percent compared with the third quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Xigris decreased 21 percent, to $23.5 million due to decreased demand, while sales outside the United States increased 14 percent, to $22.0 million.
Cialis
Total worldwide sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction marketed by Lilly ICOS LLC, were $195.1 million, a 27 percent increase compared with third-quarter 2004 worldwide sales. Worldwide Cialis sales are composed of $40.9 million of sales in Lilly territories and $154.2 million of sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, the U.S. sales of Cialis were $77.5 million in the third quarter; a 10 percent increase compared with third-quarter 2004 U.S. sales. Cialis sales in Lilly territories are reported in Lilly's revenue, while Lilly's 50 percent share of Cialis profits in the joint-venture territories is reported in Lilly's other income.
Year-to-Date Results
For the first nine months of the year, worldwide sales increased 5 percent, to $10.766 billion, compared with sales for the same period in 2004. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 29 percent and 30 percent, to $1.279 billion and $1.17, respectively, compared with
 
 
 
reported results for the first nine months in 2004. Eliminating the second-quarter 2005 product liability charge and the 2004 asset impairment and acquisition-related charges as well as assuming stock option expensing in 2004, the net income and earnings per share for the first nine months of 2005 would have increased 10 percent, to $2.259 billion and $2.07, respectively. This adjusted earnings growth was driven by sales growth and by operating expenses growing at a rate slower than sales. Refer to "Operating Results" and "Operating Results  Adjusted" later in this press release for a reconciliation of reported to adjusted operating income and net income.
Financial Expectations for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2005
The company expects fourth-quarter 2005 earnings per share of $.73 to $.79. Reported full-year 2005 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $1.96, which represents 14 percent to 18 percent growth compared with reported full-year 2004 earnings per share of $1.66. Eliminating the second-quarter 2005 product liability charge, the adjusted full-year 2005 earnings per share would be $2.80 to $2.86. This full-year figure represents 9 percent to 11 percent growth compared with the recalculated full-year 2004 earnings per share of $2.58 (refer to "Reconciliation of Earnings per Share Expectations" later in this press release for further description). The 2004 recalculated full-year earnings per share assumes stock option expensing in 2004 and eliminates the 2004 charges for tax expense on the expected repatriation of earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act; asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges; and acquired in process research and development charges related to the Applied
 
 
 
Molecular Evolution, Inc. acquisition and the insomnia compound in-license. For the full year of 2005, the company expects sales to grow 6 percent to 8 percent.
