See Item 2.06 below.
 
Item 2.06
Material Impairments
As part of the company's ongoing efforts to increase productivity and reduce its cost structure, on December 19, 2005, the company finalized decisions that will result in charges in the fourth quarter of 2005, consisting primarily of non-cash charges for the write-down of certain impaired assets, and to a lesser extent, restructuring and other special charges.
The company anticipates taking a $170 million to $190 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which will reduce fourth quarter and full year 2005 reported earnings per share by approximately $0.13 to $0.15 (after-tax).
The non-cash charges consist of asset impairments estimated at approximately $155 million to $165 million before tax. The impaired assets, which have no future use, include manufacturing buildings and equipment no longer needed to supply projected capacity requirements, as well as obsolete research and development equipment. The impairment charges will be necessary to adjust the carrying value of the assets to fair value.
The estimated cash expenditures total approximately $15 million to $25 million before tax and include contract termination payments and employee-related payments. These cash payments are expected to be made over the next three years.
