Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 26, 2006, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods and a consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. In addition, on the same day we are holding a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference will be web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as
Exhibit 99.
We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP financial measures differ from financial statements reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). There are non-GAAP financial measures used in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2005 with the same periods of 2004. Those measures are operating income, other incomenet, earnings, and earnings per share excluding the impact of:
Table of Contents
We have provided "adjusted proforma earnings per share" for the fourth quarter and full year 2004. Beginning January 1, 2005, we have adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's new accounting standard on share-based payments, "Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004)  Share-Based Payment." We determined that it would be useful to investors to provide a year-over-year comparison between 2004 and 2005 assuming comparable accounting treatment in both years. Therefore, we have provided adjusted proforma earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 that assume we had adopted the new share-based payments accounting standard at the beginning of 2004.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99, we also provided financial expectations for the full year 2006. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on an adjusted basis, excluding the effect of the 2005 items listed above. The items that are subject to the adjustments are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that could otherwise be masked or distorted by the excluded items. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain matters, such as those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press released attached as Exhibit 99 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
"As expected, 2005 was a year of two halves, with sales and earnings accelerating in the second half," said Sidney Taurel, Lilly chairman and chief executive officer. "This stronger growth benefited from our nine newer products and productivity initiatives. Looking forward to 2006, our newer products should grow to about 24 percent of revenues and earnings per share should grow 8 to 11 percent, representing top-tier growth for large-cap pharmaceutical companies. We also expect to advance our robust pipeline, with three notable submissions anticipated during 2006: Arxxant for diabetic retinopathy, Cymbalta for generalized anxiety disorder, and Evista for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women."
Fourth-Quarter Results
Worldwide sales for the quarter were $3.879 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. Worldwide sales volume increased 7 percent, selling prices increased sales 1 percent and exchange rates decreased sales by 1 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.)
 
Gross margins as a percent of sales improved by 0.6 percentage points, to 76.8 percent. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses.
Overall, marketing and administrative expenses increased 8 percent, to $1.190 billion. This increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005 and increased marketing expenses in support of newer products. The comparison benefited from a contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses were $809.9 million, or 21 percent of sales. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, research and development expenses increased 15 percent. This increase was primarily due to the fourth-quarter 2004 reimbursement of research and development expenses from Boehringer Ingelheim triggered by the European approval of Cymbalta, increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, increased discovery research expenses and the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005.
Other income increased 23 percent, to $85.2 million, primarily due to the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture becoming profitable during 2005 and increased interest income, partially offset by increased interest expense.
Income tax expense decreased 67 percent, to $172.1 million, primarily due to the fourth-quarter 2004 tax expense of $465.0 million associated with the now completed repatriation to the U.S. of $8.0 billion of eligible overseas earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. In addition, income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited from the impact of a reduction in the full-year 2005 effective tax rate of 1 percent.
Net income and earnings per share were $700.6 million and $.64, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2004 net loss of $2.4 million and no earnings per share. Results in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 were affected by several unusual items noted in the table below. Assuming stock option expensing in 2004 and excluding certain charges in 2005 and 2004, net income and earnings per share grew 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively, to $871.6 million and $.80, benefiting from sales growing at a faster rate than cost of sales and marketing and administrative expenses, increased other income and a lower effective tax rate. For further
 
detail, see reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the adjusted income statement later in this press release.
Earnings per Share Reconciliation
Full-Year Results
Worldwide sales for the full year of 2005 were $14.645 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared with 2004. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, while selling prices and exchange rates each increased sales by 1 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.)
Gross margins as a percent of sales decreased by 0.4 percentage points, to 76.3 percent. This decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses.
Overall, marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent, to $4.497 billion. This increase was primarily attributable to the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005 and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. The comparison benefited from a contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and
 
development expenses were $3.026 billion, or 21 percent of sales. Compared with 2004, research and development expenses increased 12 percent. This increase was primarily due to the adoption of stock option expensing effective January 1, 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses.
Other income increased 13 percent, to $314.2 million, primarily due to Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture becoming profitable during 2005 and increased interest income, partially offset by less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development and increased interest expense.
Income tax expense decreased 37 percent, to $715.9 million, primarily due to the 2004 tax expense of $465.0 million associated with the now completed repatriation to the U.S. of $8.0 billion of eligible overseas earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Net income and earnings per share were $1.980 billion and $1.81, respectively, compared with 2004 net income of $1.810 billion and $1.66. Results in 2005 and 2004 were affected by several unusual items noted in the table below. Assuming stock option expensing in 2004 and excluding certain charges in 2005 and 2004, net income and earnings per share grew 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, to $3.131 billion and $2.87, benefiting from sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses, increased other income and a lower effective tax rate. For further detail, see reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the adjusted income statement later in this press release.
 
Earnings per Share Reconciliation
Zyprexa
In the fourth quarter of 2005, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.032 billion, a 5 percent decrease. U.S. sales of Zyprexa decreased 15 percent, to $464.2 million, due to lower underlying demand compared with fourth quarter of 2004. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 6 percent, to $568.0 million, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets, offset in part by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased 9 percent in the fourth quarter.
For the full year of 2005, worldwide Zyprexa sales decreased 5 percent, to $4.202 billion. U.S. Zyprexa sales for 2005 were $2.035 billion, a 16 percent decrease, and international Zyprexa sales were $2.167 billion, a 9 percent increase. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2005.
Diabetes Care Products
In the fourth quarter of 2005, diabetes care revenue, composed primarily of Humalog, Humulin, Actos and recently launched Byetta, increased 11 percent, to $750.4 million,
 
compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. Diabetes care revenue increased 17 percent in the U.S., to $434.9 million. Diabetes care revenue outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $315.5 million. For the full year of 2005, worldwide diabetes care revenue increased 7 percent, to $2.797 billion.
For the fourth quarter of 2005, worldwide Humalog sales increased 9 percent, to $309.1 million, driven primarily by higher prices. Worldwide Humulin sales increased 1 percent, to $247.2 million, driven by higher prices, offset partially by decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures. Actos generated $155.0 million of revenue for Lilly, an increase of 20 percent. As previously disclosed, since Lilly's share of revenue from the agreement with Takeda will vary quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms, Actos revenue will not necessarily track with product sales. As a result, it is difficult to make quarterly comparisons for Actos revenue. Sales of Byetta, a first-in-class treatment for type 2 diabetes marketed by Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals and launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were $49.0 million in the fourth quarter. Lilly reports as revenue its 50 percent share of Byetta's gross margins and its sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin; for the fourth quarter, this revenue totaled $25.7 million.
For the full year of 2005, worldwide Humalog sales increased 9 percent, to $1.198 billion; Humulin sales increased 1 percent, to $1.005 billion; and Actos revenue to Lilly increased 9 percent, to $493.0 million. Since its June 2005 U.S. launch, Byetta generated $74.6 million in sales and Lilly reported $39.6 million of Byetta revenue.
Gemzar
Gemzar had sales totaling $352.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales in the U.S. were flat, at $154.9 million, while sales outside the U.S. increased 13 percent, to $197.7 million.
Evista
Evista sales were $265.3 million, a 3 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Evista increased 1 percent, to $170.1 million. Sales outside the United States increased 6 percent, to $95.2 million.
 
Animal Health
Worldwide sales of animal health products in the fourth quarter were $251.4 million, which was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year of 2005, animal health sales increased 8 percent, to $863.7 million.
Cymbalta
For the fourth quarter of 2005, Cymbalta, indicated for treatment of major depressive disorder as well as diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generated $228.8 million in sales. Sales are up 25 percent sequentially, compared with third quarter 2005 sales of $182.8 million.
Strattera
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Strattera, the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults, generated $168.0 million of sales, an 8 percent decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. The sales decrease was due to a decline in demand.
For the full year of 2005, Strattera sales decreased 17 percent, to $552.1 million, due to U.S. wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 resulting from restructured arrangements with Lilly's wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand, offset partially by volume growth outside the U.S. reflecting launches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico and Spain.
Alimta
For the fourth quarter of 2005, Alimta, a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, generated sales of $135.8 million, representing a sequential increase of 11 percent compared with third-quarter 2005 sales of $122.3 million. In the fourth quarter, U.S. sales of Alimta were $86.5 million and sales outside the U.S. were $49.4 million.
Forteo
Fourth-quarter sales of Forteo, a treatment for severe osteoporosis, were $118.0 million, a 59 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Forteo increased 43 percent, to $81.2 million. Sales outside the U.S. grew 110 percent, to $36.7 million.
 
Xigris
Fourth-quarter sales of Xigris, the first available pharmaceutical treatment for severe sepsis, were $51.8 million, a decrease of 6 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of Xigris decreased 14 percent, to $27.3 million, due to decreased demand, while sales outside the United States increased 3 percent, to $24.5 million. For the full year of 2005, Xigris sales were $214.6 million, an increase of 6 percent compared with 2004.
Cialis
Total worldwide fourth-quarter sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction marketed by Lilly ICOS LLC, were $210.5 million, a 38 percent increase compared with fourth-quarter 2004 worldwide sales. Worldwide Cialis sales are composed of $45.0 million of sales in Lilly territories and $165.5 million of sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, the U.S. sales of Cialis were $81.6 million in the fourth quarter, a 55 percent increase compared with fourth-quarter 2004 U.S. sales. Cialis sales in Lilly territories are reported in Lilly's revenue, while Lilly's 50 percent share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses, is reported in Lilly's other income.
For the full year of 2005, Cialis worldwide sales increased 35 percent, to $746.6 million, of which $169.9 million represents sales in Lilly territories and $576.7 million relates to sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, the U.S. sales of Cialis increased 32 percent, to $272.9 million, in 2005.
2006 Financial Guidance
The company expects 2006 earnings per share of $.73 to $.75 for the first quarter and $3.10 to $3.20 for the full year. This represents 7 percent to 10 percent growth compared with first-quarter 2005 earnings per share of $.68 and 8 percent to 11 percent growth compared with 2005 adjusted earnings per share. See reconciliation below for further detail.
 
For 2006, the company expects sales to grow 7 percent to 9 percent and gross margins as a percent of sales to improve modestly compared with 2005. In addition, the company expects operating expenses to grow in the mid-single digits in the aggregate, with marketing and administrative expenses accelerating while research and development expense growth moderates somewhat. However, Lilly will continue to be among the industry leaders in terms of research and development investment as a percent of sales. The company also expects other income to contribute approximately $175 million to $275 million; this ongoing net contribution is driven primarily by net interest income, Lilly ICOS joint venture after-tax profit and partnering and out-licensing of molecules. The company also anticipates the effective tax rate to be approximately 21 percent. In terms of cash flow, the company expects capital expenditures to be flat at about $1.4 billion in 2006.
