The determination of the Eligible Person's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such request, advise the Board in writing of the Eligible Person's request.
     (b) An Eligible Person's entitlement to indemnification under this Article shall be determined in one of the following methods, such method to be selected by the Board of Directors, regardless of whether there are any Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined): (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board; (ii) by a written opinion of Special Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (A) a Change in Control shall have occurred and the Eligible Person so requests or (B) a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (iii) by the shareholders of the Corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board, presents the issue of entitlement to the shareholders for their determination); or (iv) as provided in subsection (d).
     (c) In the event of the determination of entitlement is to be made by Special Counsel, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Special Counsel, but only Special Counsel to which the Eligible Person does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change in
 
Control shall have occurred, the Eligible Person shall select such Special Counsel, but only Special Counsel to which a majority of the Disinterested Directors does not reasonably object.
     (d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Eligible Person shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification (with respect to actions or failures to act occurring prior to such Change in Control) upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with subsection (a), and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under subsection (c) to determine entitlement shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the Eligible Person shall be deemed to be, and shall be, entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses unless (i) the Eligible Person misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of an Eligible Person to indemnification or create a presumption that the Eligible Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Eligible Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the Eligible Person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere

     (f) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts incurred by the Eligible Person within ten (10) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (i) the Eligible Person misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that (A) any advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 6.3 or (B) payment of indemnification is not made within ten (10) days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made, the Eligible Person shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation's obligation, to pay to the Eligible Person such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Indiana or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Eligible Person to receive indemnification
 
hereunder due to the occurrence of an event described in clause (i) or (ii) of this subsection (f) (a "Disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.

     (h) In the event that the Eligible Person seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of this Article, the Eligible Person shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation, against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Eligible Person if the Eligible Person prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Eligible Person is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Eligible Person in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly.
