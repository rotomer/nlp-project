Item 8.01 Other Events.
Eli Lilly and Company today announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement whereby Lilly will acquire Hypnion, Inc., a privately held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep disorders. The transaction has received the requisite approval of Hypnion stockholders and is expected to close near the end of the first quarter of 2007, contingent upon clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Upon closing, Lilly will incur a charge to earnings for acquired in-process research and development. The amount of the charge has not been finalized but is not expected to exceed $0.30 per share. The acquisition will not otherwise have a material impact on Lillys earnings per share for 2007. The transaction will be funded by existing cash balances and will not materially affect Lillys liquidity. Lilly expects to maintain its debt ratings from Standard & Poor s and Moodys of AA and Aa3, respectively.
