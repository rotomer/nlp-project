On December 17, 2007, Sidney Taurel, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company, announced his retirement as chief executive officer as of March 31, 2008, and as chairman and a member of the board of directors as of December 31, 2008. Mr. Taurel, a 36-year Lilly employee, has served as CEO since July 1998 and chairman since January 1999. On the same day, the board of directors elected John C. Lechleiter, Ph. D., as president and chief executive officer effective April 1, 2008. All company officers are elected to one-year terms expiring at the companys annual meeting of the board of directors in April. Accordingly, Dr. Lechleiters initial term of office as CEO and president will expire on the date of the next annual directors meeting to be held on April 21, 2008. Dr. Lechleiter, age 54, has served as president and chief operating officer of the company and a member of the board of directors since October 2005. He joined Lilly in 1979 as a s enior organic chemist and has held a broad range of scientific and general management positions at the company. Before assuming his current position, he served as vice president for pharmaceutical products and corporate development from 2001-04 and executive vice president of pharmaceutical operations from 2004-05. The compensation committee of the board of directors approved compensation for Mr. Taurel in his new role. As chairman, Mr. Taurel will remain an employee of the company until his retirement on December 31, 2008. Effective April 1, 2008, his base salary will be reduced by half. Under the terms of the Bonus Plan, his annualized non-equity incentive award opportunity, which is calculated as a percentage of base salary, will also be reduced by half. Thus, effective April 1, 2008, Mr. Taurel will receive the following annualized base salary and target non-equity incentive plan compensation: Annualized Base Salary -- $864,250 Annualized Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation -- $1,209,950* * This amount represents the target bonus under the Bonus Plan, assuming the listed salary was paid for the entire calendar year. Actual bonuses paid for a given calendar year will be calculated on actual base salary earnings for the year. Payouts may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target amount, depending on the companys results relative to predetermined corporate performance measures that are based 25 percent on sales growth and 75 percent on earnings-per-share growth (adjusted for unusual items in accordance with predetermined criteria). The compensation committee will set compensation for Dr. Lechleiter in his new role prior to April 1, 2008.
