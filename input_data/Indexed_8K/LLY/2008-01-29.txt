Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 29, 2008, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was webcast and podcast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the fourth quarter and full year 2007, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes an adjusted pro forma presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 with the same periods of 2006. Those measures include operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following charges (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
In addition, the pro forma adjusted presentation assumes that the acquisition of ICOS was completed on January 1, 2006, and includes adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2006 and full years of both 2006 and 2007 for the ICOS acquisition.
 
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we also confirmed financial expectations for 2008. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on an adjusted pro forma basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2007 results and expected 2008 results, we:
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
In accordance with GAAP, we have provided pro forma results in order to help investors make meaningful comparisons of 2007 to 2006 results and identify underlying operating trends that might otherwise be masked by the inclusion of ICOS results in a part of 2007.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
"Lilly completed a very successful year by continuing to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders in the fourth quarter," commented Sidney Taurel, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our additional investment in sales and marketing helped fuel accelerated double-digit sales growth this quarter, which was once again driven mainly by volume. Our performance provided the financial flexibility we sought to make appropriate investments in research and development, resulting in an unprecedented 16 new candidates entering the clinic in 2007 and the execution of several strategic in-licensing transactions. Looking ahead to 2008, Lilly is intent on building upon the success of the past year, while driving change, continuing productivity initiatives and achieving superior results under the leadership of John Lechleiter."
Fourth-Quarter Reported Results
Worldwide reported sales for the quarter were $5.190 billion, an increase of 22 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. Worldwide sales volume increased 15 percent, while exchange rates and selling prices contributed 4 and 3 percentage points of sales growth, respectively.
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points, to 75.5 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, offset in part by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.
Overall, marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 34 percent, to $1.756 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Research and development expenses were $953.6 million, or 18 percent of sales. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, research and
 
development expenses grew 11 percent. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this growth was due to increases in discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs.
Other income decreased by $70.6 million, to $32.1 million, primarily due to the acquisition of ICOS and higher net interest expense. Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture were presented in other income. Subsequent to the acquisition, all sales and expenses associated with Cialis are included in their respective lines on Lilly's income statement.
The reported effective tax rate was 18.8 percent, down from 38.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The reported effective tax rate of 18.8 percent was favorably impacted by changes in estimates of the anticipated tax rate benefit from our international operations in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 38.5 percent effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2006 was negatively impacted by the lower tax benefit associated with a fourth-quarter 2006 Zyprexa product liability charge.
Reported net income and earnings per share increased to $854.4 million and $.78, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2006 net income of $132.3 million and earnings per share of $.12 due primarily to fourth-quarter 2006 asset impairment, restructuring and Zyprexa product liability chargesFourth-quarter 2007 reported results include a $.07 per share charge for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges described in footnote (a) of the attached pro forma adjusted income statement, as well as a $.05 per share charge related to acquired in-process research and development associated with the MacroGenics and Glenmark in-licensing transactions.
.
Fourth-Quarter Pro Forma Adjusted Results
Worldwide pro forma sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $5.190 billion, an increase of 16 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. Worldwide pro forma sales volume increased 8 percent, while exchange rates and selling prices each contributed 4 percentage points of the sales growth. Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased by 0.6 percentage points, to 75.5 percent. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased 23 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Total operating expenses grew 17 percent. Other income decreased $6.8 million. The effective tax rate was 20.4 percent.
 
Pro forma adjusted net income and earnings per share both grew 10 percent, to $986.4 million and $.90, respectively, as a result of cost of sales and marketing and administrative expenses in support of key growth products both growing at a faster rate than sales. Pro forma adjusted results exclude the charges noted in the table below. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the pro forma adjusted income statement later in this press release.
Full-Year 2007 Reported Results
Worldwide reported sales for the full-year 2007 were $18.634 billion, an increase of 19 percent compared with 2006. Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while exchange rates and selling prices each contributed 3 percentage points of sales growth, respectively. (Numbers do not add due to rounding).
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased by 0.2 percentage points, to 77.2 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the impact of foreign exchange rates and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, partially offset by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.
Overall, marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 25 percent, to $6.095 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Research and development expenses were
 
$3.487 billion, or 19 percent of sales. Compared with 2006, research and development expenses increased 11 percent. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs.
Other income decreased by $115.8 million, to $122.0 million, primarily due to the acquisition of ICOS and higher net interest expense, offset in part by higher business development income resulting from out-licensing of development-stage products. Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture were presented in other income. Subsequent to the acquisition, all sales and expenses associated with Cialis are included in their respective lines on Lilly's income statement.
The reported effective tax rate was 23.8 percent, up from 22.1 percent in 2006.
Full-year 2007 reported net income and earnings per share both increased 11 percent to $2.953 billion and $2.71, respectively, compared with 2006 net income of $2.663 billion and earnings per share of $2.45. The 2007 and 2006 reported results include all charges listed in the reconciliation table below.
Full-Year 2007 Pro Forma Adjusted Results
Worldwide pro forma sales for the full-year 2007 were $18.706 billion, an increase of 14 percent compared with 2006. Worldwide pro forma sales volume increased 7 percent, while exchange rates and selling prices contributed 3 and 4 percentage points of the sales growth, respectively. Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased by 0.1 percentage points, to 77.2 percent. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased 16 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Total operating expenses grew 12 percent. Other income increased by $97.1 million. The effective tax rate was 21.4 percent.
As a result of pro forma sales growing faster than operating expenses and higher other income, 2007 pro forma adjusted net income and earnings per share both grew 17 percent, to $3.863 billion and $3.54, respectively. Pro forma adjusted results exclude the charges noted in the table below. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the pro forma adjusted income statement later in this press release.

Worldwide sales of animal health products in the fourth quarter were $329.4 million, an increase of 27 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. U.S. sales grew 37 percent to $179.7 million driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, Inc. and new companion animal product launches. Sales outside the U.S. grew 16 percent to $149.7 million driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of exchange rates and higher prices.
For the full year of 2007, worldwide sales of animal health products increased 14 percent, to $995.8 million. U.S. animal health sales for 2007 were $480.9 million, an 18 percent increase driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, and new companion animal product launches. Animal health sales outside the U.S. were $514.9 million, a 10 percent increase, driven by favorable exchange rates and increased demand.
2008 Financial Guidance
The company confirmed its full-year 2008 financial guidance. For 2008, the company expects pro forma sales to grow in the mid- to high-single digits, driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for Cymbalta, Cialis, Byetta, Alimta and Humalog. The company expects modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales, driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing more slowly than sales. Total operating expenses are also expected to grow more slowly than sales, with growth in the mid-single digits. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the low-single digits, driven by investments in prasugrel, Cymbalta, Evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, Humalog and Byetta, offset by decreases in other areas. Research and development expenses are expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. Other income is expected to contribute less than $100 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $1.1 billion.
The company expects 2008 pro forma adjusted earnings per share to be within the range of $3.85 to $4.00. The pro forma adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes an estimated $.05 charge noted in the table below related to the in-licensing transaction with BioMS. Including this $.05 charge, the company expects reported earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.95. See the reconciliation table below for further detail.
