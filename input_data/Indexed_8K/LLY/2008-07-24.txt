Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 24, 2008, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, including, among other things, an income statement and balance sheet for those periods. In addition, on the same day we are holding a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference will be web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as
Exhibit 99.
We provide non-GAAP financial information that differs from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99 and in related communications about our results, we use non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 with the same periods of 2007. Those measures include earnings per share and gross margin as a percent of sales without the effect of several items affecting the relevant accounting periods:
 
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99, we also provided financial expectations for the full year 2008. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided expectations for earnings per share, effective tax rate, and gross margin as a percent of sales as they would have been without certain items. The relevant items include those described above for the first six months of 2007 and 2008 and the items below in the second half of 2007:
The items identified above are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that this non-GAAP information is useful to investors and may help them evaluate our ongoing operations. This information can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider this non-GAAP information in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP information, our prospective earnings may be affected by future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

For Release:
Refer to:
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2008.
Second-quarter results are presented on a reported basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all sales and expenses recognized by the company during the period. Year-to-date financial results are presented on both a reported and a pro forma basis. Pro forma results assume the ICOS acquisition was completed January 1, 2007. Pro forma results for the second quarter are not presented because the company completed the ICOS acquisition prior to second quarter of 2007.
Second-Quarter Highlights
 
Product Sales Highlights
 
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
"Lilly continued to deliver solid financial results in the second quarter, including double-digit growth in sales and earnings," commented John Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly president and chief executive officer. "Our newer products, including Cymbalta, Cialis, and Alimta continued to perform exceptionally well, while our diabetes care franchise has made good progress. During the quarter, we also remained engaged in business development activities designed to strengthen
 
our R&D capabilities, resulting in both the in-licensing deal with TransPharma and the announced acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals."
Worldwide sales for the quarter were $5.150 billion, an increase of 11 percent compared with the second quarter of 2007. Exchange rates contributed 6 percent of worldwide sales growth, while sales volume increased 5 percent. Changes in selling prices did not impact overall sales growth.
Second-Quarter Results
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased by 1.7 percentage points, to 76.7 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and the inclusion in cost of sales of asset impairments at certain manufacturing facilities of $57.1 million in the second quarter of 2008, offset in part by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Without the asset impairments, gross margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 77.8 percent.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 12 percent, to $1.700 billion. This increase was due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, increased marketing expenses (including those for Evista's new indication for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta, and prelaunch expenses for prasugrel), and increased litigation-related expenses. Research and development expenses were $951.5 million, or 18 percent of sales. Compared with the second quarter of 2007, research and development expenses grew 11 percent. This increase was primarily due to a $47.0 million expense for a milestone payment made to MacroGenics, Inc. related to progress in the clinical trials of teplizumab, increased discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs, offset by lower prasugrel clinical trial costs.
The company recognized a charge of $35.0 million in the second quarter of 2008 for acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing transaction with TransPharma Medical. In the second quarter of 2007, the company recognized a charge of $328.1 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the acquisitions of Hypnion, Inc. and Ivy Animal Health.
 
The company recognized restructuring (exit costs) and other special charges of $88.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily associated with previously-announced strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations.
Other income increased by $30.5 million, to $32.3 million, primarily due to lower interest expense and gains from the sale of securities, offset by lower out-licensing income.
The effective tax rate was 20.5 percent, down from 28.4 percent in the second quarter of 2007. The decline in the effective tax rate is due to the nondeductibility of the in-process research and development charge for the Hypnion acquisition in the second quarter of 2007, and the deductibility of the asset impairment and restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2008.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $958.8 million and $.88, respectively, compared with second-quarter 2007 net income of $663.6 million and earnings per share of $.61.
Net income was affected by significant items totaling $.11 and $.29 for the second quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2007, respectively, which are reflected in the company's financial results and are summarized below and in the table that follows:
Second-Quarter Significant Items Affecting Net Income
2008
 
2007
In the second quarter of 2008, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.240 billion, a 2 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2007. U.S. sales of Zyprexa were essentially flat at $563.6 million. The impact from changes in both net selling prices and volume was negligible. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 4 percent, to $676.2 million, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and decreased demand. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Canada and Germany, offset by growth in Japan and several European markets.
Zyprexa
For the second quarter of 2008, Cymbalta generated $654.4 million in sales, an increase of 26 percent compared with the second quarter of 2007. U.S. sales of Cymbalta increased 19 percent, to $542.8 million, driven primarily by higher demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $111.5 million, an increase of 80 percent, driven primarily by higher demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Higher demand outside the U.S. reflects both increased demand in established markets, as well as recent launches in new markets.
Cymbalta
 
Gemzar sales totaled $440.1 million in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 11 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Sales in the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $183.3 million, due to increased demand and higher prices, while sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, to $256.8 million, as a result of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Gemzar
For the second quarter of 2008, worldwide Humalog sales increased 22 percent, to $437.9 million. Sales in the U.S. increased 17 percent to $249.5 million, driven by higher demand and increased prices.

Humalog
Cialis sales for the second quarter of 2008 were $362.2 million, representing growth of 24 percent compared with second-quarter 2007. U.S. sales of Cialis were $128.4 million in the second quarter, a 17 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2007, driven by higher prices and increased demand.

Cialis
Evista sales were $279.8 million in the second quarter of 2008, a 1 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2007. U.S. sales of Evista increased 1 percent at $178.3 million, as a result of higher prices, partially offset by lower demand.

U.S. sales of Alimta increased 21 percent, to $129.6 million, due primarily to increased demand, while sales outside the U.S. increased 46 percent, to $145.4 million, due primarily to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Alimta
Second-quarter sales of Forteo were $206.6 million, a 17 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2007. U.S. sales of Forteo increased 5 percent, to $129.4 million, driven by higher prices partially offset by decreased demand.

U.S. sales decreased 13 percent, to $101.4 million, due to a decline in demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 35 percent, to $33.8 million, due primarily to higher demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.

of Ivy Animal Health, Inc. Sales outside the U.S. grew 16 percent, to $137.7 million, driven by both increased demand and the favorable impact of exchange rates.
For the first six months of 2008, worldwide reported and pro forma sales increased 12 percent, to $9.958 billion, compared with sales for the same period in 2007. Reported net income and earnings per share were $2.023 billion and $1.85, respectively.
Year-to-Date Results
In addition to the second-quarter 2008 and 2007 significant items previously mentioned, net income for the first six months of 2008 and the first six months of 2007 were also affected by significant items occurring in the first quarter of the respective years that are reflected in the company's financial results and are summarized below and included in the table that follows:
Year-to-Date Significant Items Affecting Net Income
2008
2007
 
The company's full-year 2008 reported earnings guidance is now $3.79 to $3.94 per share. The change from earlier guidance of $3.90 to $4.05 per share results from the previously mentioned second-quarter 2008 significant items totaling $.11 per share that are reflected in our financial results. The company's full-year 2008 earnings per share guidance does not reflect potential charges related to the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals.
2008 Financial Guidance
 
2008 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
The company has also revised other aspects of its previously-issued 2008 full-year financial guidance. These revisions are primarily driven by the continued strength of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Stronger foreign currencies result in higher growth rates for the company's sales, for its marketing, selling and administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, for its research and development expenses. In addition, in the short-term, stronger foreign currencies result in a decrease to the company's gross margin as a percent of sales.
Pro forma sales are now expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Excluding the impact of the second-quarter 2008 asset impairment charges, the company still expects modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales. Including the second-quarter 2008 asset impairment charges, the company expects gross margin as a percent of sales to be essentially flat. The sum of marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses is now expected to grow in the high-single digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the mid-single digits. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now expected to grow in the high-single digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the low-single digits. In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, these expenses are now expected to be higher due to increased litigation-related expenses and higher pre-launch investment in prasugrel. The company still expects research and development expenses to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. Other income and deductions are still expected to contribute less than $100 million. Excluding the effect of the resolution of the IRS tax audit in the first quarter of 2008, the effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22 percent.

Eli Lilly and Company Consolidated Balance Sheet (Dollars in millions)
 
*Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements
During the second quarter of 2008, the company determined that its methodology for calculating its return reserve for future product returns in accordance with SFAS 48, needed to be modified. Using the new methodology, the company's return reserve was understated by $247.5 million as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists,
The income statement was not adjusted for any of the years or quarters because the company concluded that the amount of the adjustment calculated using the new methodology was not material in any period. The amount of the annual adjustment for 2005, 2006, or 2007 would have been $.01 per share or less. The aggregate income statement impact from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2007 would have been an additional expense of approximately $35 million on a pre-tax basis (approximately $23 million net of tax). Approximately $8 million of benefit on a pre-tax basis (approximately $5 million net of tax), recognized in the second quarter as a result of a reduction in the return reserve, was related to the first quarter of 2008.
The effect of the restatement on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 is as follows:
