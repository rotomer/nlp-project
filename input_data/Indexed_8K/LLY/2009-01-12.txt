Eli Lilly & Company
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
On November 24, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for $70.00 per share or a total purchase price of approximately $6.5 billion. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet presents our historical financial position combined with ImClone as if the acquisition and the financing for the acquisition had occurred on September 30, 2008, and includes adjustments which give effect to events that are directly attributable to the transaction and that are factually supportable, regardless of whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income present the combined results of our operations with ImClone as if the acquisition and the financing for the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented and include adjustments that are directly attributable to the acquisition, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, and are factually supportable. The pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had we completed the merger at the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the:
We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, our estimated cost to acquire ImClone of approximately $6.5 billion has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. We are currently determining the fair values of a significant portion of these net assets. The preliminary work performed in estimating the fair values is reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
This final valuation will be based on the actual assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although the final determination may result in asset and liability fair values that are different than the preliminary estimates of these amounts included herein, it is not expected that those differences will be material to an understanding of the impact of this transaction to our financial results.

Note 1: Description of transaction and basis of presentation
On November 24, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for an estimated purchase price of approximately $6.5 billion. The merger has been accounted for as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of ImClone are recorded as of the completion of the merger, at their respective fair values, and consolidated with our assets and liabilities. The results of operations of ImClone will be consolidated beginning on the date of the merger. Our financial statements issued after completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of ImClone.
Note 2: Purchase price
For the purposes of this pro forma analysis, the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated based on an estimate of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of the date of acquisition. The determination of estimated fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The final valuation of net assets is expected to be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. We will adjust our estimates as needed based upon the final valuation.
 
 
Note 3: Accounting Policies and Financial Statement Classifications
As a result of our review of ImClone's accounting policies and financial statement classifications, we determined it necessary to make certain reclassifications to their unaudited condensed financial statements to conform to accounting policies and classifications that are consistent with our practices. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, these reclassifications are included in ImClone's financial results prior to pro forma adjustments and primarily relate to the following:
License fees and milestones of $102.9 million (2007) and $77.7 million (2008) were classified as other income  net;
Litigation settlements of $110.0 million (2007) and $17.5 million (2008) were classified as asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, respectively;
Loss on impairment of securities available for sale of $102.0 million (2008) was classified as asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges;
Merger expenses of $2.8 million (2008) were classified as marketing, selling, and administrative expenses;
Royalties expense of $71.5 million (2007) and $69.5 million (2008) and cost of manufacturing revenue expenses of $83.0 million (2007) and $68.2 million (2008) were classified as cost of sales; and
Collaboration reimbursements of $70.0 million (2007) and $60.7 million (2008) were classified as reductions to cost of sales; research and development; and marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
As our purchase accounting is still preliminary, it may be necessary to make additional classification adjustments to the consolidated financial statements; however we do not anticipate that any change would be material to the understanding of the impact of this acquisition on our financial results.
