Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 29, 2009, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the fourth quarter and full year 2008, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes an adjusted pro forma presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma non-GAAP net income and pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 with the same periods of 2007. Those measures include net sales, operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
 
In addition, the pro forma non-GAAP presentation assumes that the acquisition of ICOS was completed on January 1, 2007, and includes adjustments to the full year of 2007 for the ICOS acquisition.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we also confirmed financial expectations for 2009. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on an pro forma non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2008 results and expected 2009 results, we:
 
The items that we exclude when we provide non-GAAP results or expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
In accordance with GAAP, we have provided pro forma results in order to help investors make meaningful comparisons of 2008 to 2007 results and 2009 expectations and identify underlying operating trends that might otherwise be masked by the inclusion of ICOS results in a part of 2007 or ImClone results in a part of 2008.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

For Release:
Refer to:
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008.
Due to significant strategic actions taken by the company in 2008, financial results are presented on both a reported basis and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all sales and expenses recognized by the company during the period. Pro forma non-GAAP results exclude significant items described in the reconciliation tables and also assume the ICOS acquisition was completed January 1, 2007. The pro forma non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Pro forma non-GAAP guidance assumes the ImClone acquisition was completed on January 1, 2008.
Fourth-Quarter Highlights
 
2008 Highlights
"2008 was a year of significant transformation for our company," commented John C. Lechleiter, chairman and chief executive officer. "Throughout the year, Lilly executed well on its operational and strategic priorities. Despite a tempering of sales growth in the fourth quarter due to unfavorable exchange rates, moderation in U.S. demand and some variations in wholesaler and retailer buying patterns, the company delivered 9 percent sales growth for the year, with a record 8 products each achieving over $1 billion in sales. Our solid financial performance, driven by volume-based sales growth, improved gross margins and better productivity, allowed us to make important investments to advance our pipeline of promising molecules, resolve much of the uncertainty surrounding product litigation, and complete several strategic business development transactions, most notably the ImClone acquisition. We enter 2009 with an unprecedented 60 molecules in clinical development, and an unwavering commitment to deliver improved outcomes for individual patients."
 
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
Fourth-Quarter Significant Items Affecting Reported Net Income (Loss)
The reported results for the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007 were affected by significant items totaling $4.38 and $.12 per share, respectively, which are summarized below and in the table that follows:
2008
2007
 
Fourth-Quarter Results
Worldwide sales for the quarter were $5.210 billion, essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. U.S. sales grew 3 percent to $2.938 billion, while sales outside the U.S. declined 3 percent to $2.272 billion. Increased net effective selling prices in the U.S. and increased volume outside the U.S. were offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower U.S. volume caused in part by variations in wholesaler buying patterns for Zyprexa. Worldwide sales volume increased 1 percent and selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of sales growth, while the impact of exchange rates decreased sales growth by 3 percent.
Gross margin as a percent of sales increased by 6.9 percentage points, to 82.4 percent. Substantially all of this increase was due to the impact of the rapid decline in the Euro compared to the U.S. Dollar during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a benefit to cost of sales.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent, to $1.727 billion. This decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased advertising costs, partially offset by increased prasugrel pre-launch activities, as well as funding for the Lilly Foundation. Research and development expenses were $1.059 billion, or 20 percent of sales. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2007, research and development expenses grew 11 percent due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs.
 
The company recognized a charge of $4.685 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 for acquired in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of ImClone Systems. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the company recognized a charge of $89.0 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the MacroGenics and Glenmark in-licensings.
The company recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $98.2 million.
Other income decreased by $113.3 million, to a net expense of $81.2 million, primarily due to a $47.6 million net loss on investment securities (the majority of which are unrealized) and higher interest expense associated with the ImClone acquisition.
The company recognized income tax expense of $292.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 despite having a loss before income taxes of $3.337 billion. The company's net loss for the fourth quarter was driven by the $4.685 billion in-process research and development charge for ImClone. The in-process research and development charge was not tax deductible. In addition, the company recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $136.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, which was associated with the EDPA settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate was 18.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Primarily as a result of the ImClone acquisition charges, on a reported basis the company recorded a net loss of $3.629 billion, or $3.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with fourth-quarter 2007 net income of $854.4 million and earnings per share of $.78.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1.177 billion, or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with fourth-quarter 2007 net income of $986.4 million, or $.90 per share. This increase was driven by an improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales.
Full-Year 2008 Significant Items Affecting Reported Net Income (Loss)
 
In addition to the fourth-quarter 2008 and 2007 significant items previously mentioned, reported net income for the full-year 2008 and 2007 were also affected by significant items occurring in the first nine months of the respective years that are summarized below and included in the table that follows:
2008
2007
 
Full-Year 2008 Results
Worldwide sales for 2008 were $20.378 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared with 2007. Sales volume increased 5 percent, while exchange rates contributed 3 percent of worldwide sales growth and selling prices contributed 2 percent (numbers do not add due to rounding).
Gross margin as a percent of sales increased by 1.3 percentage points, to 78.5 percent. This increase was primarily due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates.
 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses rose 9 percent, to $6.626 billion. This increase was due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including prasugrel pre-launch activities and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange rates and increased litigation-related expenses. Research and development expenses were $3.841 billion, or 19 percent of sales. Compared with the full-year 2007, research and development expenses grew 10 percent. This increase was primarily due to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs.
The company recognized charges of $4.835 billion in 2008 for acquired in-process research and development associated with the ImClone and SGX acquisitions and the in-licensing arrangements with BioMS and Transpharma Medical. In 2007, the company recognized a charge of $745.6 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion and Ivy, and the in-licensing arrangements with MacroGenics, Glenmark and OSI.
The company recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.974 billion in 2008, primarily associated with charges totaling $1.477 billion related to Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and multiple states. In 2007, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $302.5 million.
Other income decreased by $148.1 million in 2008, to a net expense of $26.1 million, primarily due to lower out-licensing income and a net loss on investment securities (the majority of which are unrealized).
The company recognized income tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008 despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.308 billion. The company's net loss was driven by the $4.685 billion in-process research and development charge for ImClone and the $1.415 billion Zyprexa investigation settlement. The in-process research and development charge was not tax deductible, while the Zyprexa investigation settlement was partially deductible. In addition, the company recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of the IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2007.
 
As a result of the charges for the ImClone acquisition and Zyprexa investigation settlements, on a reported basis the company recorded a 2008 net loss of $2.072 billion, or $1.89 loss per share, compared with 2007 net income of $2.953 billion and earnings per share of $2.71.
On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $4.399 billion, or $4.02 per share for the full-year 2008, compared with full-year 2007 net income of $3.863 billion, or $3.54 per share.
Product Sales Highlights
 
 
Zyprexa
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.147 billion, a 10 percent decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. U.S. sales of Zyprexa decreased 4 percent to $584.0 million, driven by lower demand caused in part by variations in wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by increased net effective selling prices. Zyprexa sales in international markets decreased 15 percent, to $562.7 million, driven by decreased demand, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and, to a lesser extent, lower prices. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Germany and Canada, partially offset by growth in Japan. As noted above, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German market.
For the full-year of 2008, worldwide Zyprexa sales decreased 1 percent to $4.696 billion. U.S. Zyprexa sales for 2008 were $2.203 billion, a 1 percent decrease driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices.

2009 Financial Guidance
The company reconfirmed its 2009 earnings per share guidance range of $4.00 to $4.25, including the estimated $.30 to $.35 dilution impact from the ImClone acquisition. Excluding the estimated ImClone dilution, 2009 earnings per share for Lilly's base operations are expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55.
 
Moving forward, the company's financial results will be reported including the impact of the ImClone acquisition. Consequently, both earnings per share and line item guidance will now focus on expectations for the company's results including ImClone. To provide meaningful yearly growth rates, 2009 non-GAAP results and guidance will be compared to 2008 pro forma non-GAAP results restated as if Lilly had completed the ImClone acquisition on January 1, 2008. Therefore, 2009 earnings per share guidance of $4.00 to $4.25 will be compared to 2008 pro-forma non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.82.
2009 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
The company expects volume growth in sales again in 2009, driven by Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Humalog and the anticipated launches of prasugrel, as well as by the Elanco animal health division. However, the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies and the impact of generic competition in certain markets for Gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts. As a result, the company expects low-single digit sales growth on a pro-forma non-GAAP basis and mid-single digit sales growth on a reported basis.
 
The company expects gross margin as a percent of sales to increase, driven by the strengthening dollar. This increase could be more pronounced in the first half of 2009.
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are projected to show flat to low-single digit growth. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the high-single digits on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and in the low-double digits on a reported basis.
Other income is expected to be a net loss of between $200 million and $250 million, and the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22 percent. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion and the company expects continued strong operating cash flow.
