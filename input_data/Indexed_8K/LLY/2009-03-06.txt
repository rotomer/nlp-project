Certain Agreements of the Underwriters
     (a) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely a result of use by such underwriter, would not
 
trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule 3 to the Underwriting Agreement or prepared pursuant to Section 1(c) or Section 5(c) above (including any electronic road show), or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing (each such free writing prospectus referred to in clauses (i) or (iii), an ".") Notwithstanding the foregoing the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Schedule 4 to the Underwriting Agreement without the consent of the Company.
Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus
     (b) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering of the Offered Securities (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).
     7. . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by such Underwriter in writing through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information.
 
     In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel reasonably incurred related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative(s), in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
     If the indemnification provided for in the first or second paragraph in this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in connection with any offering of Offered Securities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
 
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters under the Underwriting Agreement, and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any
 
person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
     8. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Representative(s)' absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if, after the earlier of the Time of Sale and the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, any of the following shall have occurred: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or on NYSE Alternext US; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representative(s) makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
     9. . If on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase on such date, and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite their respective names above bears to the aggregate amount of Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representative(s) may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the amount of Offered Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Offered Securities and the aggregate amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative(s) and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.
Defaulting Underwriters
provided
 
In any such case either the Representative(s) or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date but in no event for longer then seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     10. . If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representative(s) because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities, and upon demand, the Company shall pay the full amount to the Representative(s). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof or pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse the Underwriters for such expenses.
Payment of Expenses Upon Termination
     11. . The Underwriting Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Miscellaneous
     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
     12. . The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A
[Names/Addresses of Managers]
as Representatives of the several Underwriters
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special counsel to Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the sale by the Company, and the purchase by the several underwriters named in Schedule 1 (the "Underwriters") to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March [ ], 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company, and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives (the "Representatives") of the Underwriters, severally, of $[     ] principal amount of the Company's [ % Notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes"), $[     ] principal amount of the Company's [     ]% Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $[ principal amount of the Company's [     ]% Notes due 2037 (the "2037 Notes," and collectively with the 2012 Notes and the 2014 Notes, the "Notes"), in each case having the terms set forth in Schedule 4 to the Underwriting Agreement. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1991 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as successor trustee (the "Trustee") to Citibank, N.A., the original trustee.
     As special counsel for the Company, we have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, instruments, certificates, records and other documents and have made such examination of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this letter, including the following:
     (1) Copy of the automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-141075), registering the offer and sale of certain debt securities of the Company (including the Notes), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement,
 
together with the Incorporated Documents (as defined below), is hereinafter called, collectively, the "Registration Statement."
     (2) Copies of (i) the prospectus, dated March [     ], 2009 (the "Base Prospectus"), (ii) the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated March [     ], 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), (iii) the free writing prospectus, dated March [     ], 2009 (such free writing prospectus, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations, is hereinafter called the "FWP") and (iv) the prospectus supplement, dated March [     ], 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Base Prospectus, in the forms filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, together with the Incorporated Documents, are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Preliminary Prospectus." The Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Base Prospectus, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, together with the Incorporated Documents, are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Prospectus." As used herein, the term "Incorporated Documents," when used with respect to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, means the documents set forth in Annex A attached hereto.
     (3) Executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement.
     (4) Executed copy of the Indenture.
     (5) Forms of global notes representing the Notes.
     In connection with this letter, we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification, the legal capacity of all natural persons signing any document, the genuineness of signatures of all persons signing any document, the authority of all persons signing any document on behalf of the parties thereto, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or obtained by us from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system or other sites on the internet, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents and the truth and accuracy of all matters of fact set forth in all documents. As to facts and other matters relevant to the opinions or other statements set forth herein, we have relied, without independent investigation or verification, upon, and assumed the accuracy and completeness of, certificates, letters and oral or written representations or other statements of governmental authorities, public officials, officers and other representatives of the Company and its counsel and accountants, and others, including, without limitation, the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement.
     Based on and subject to the foregoing and the other assumptions, limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
     The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and is a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
     The Notes, when duly authorized and executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee and duly delivered against payment therefor, all in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     The Notes and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the description thereof in the General Disclosure Package (as defined below) and the Prospectus.
     The statements set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations" constitute a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects.
     Each of the Registration Statement, as of the date it first became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, in each case including the Incorporated Documents, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations for registration statements on Form S-3 or related prospectuses, as the case may be, except in each case that we express no opinion with respect to (A) financial statements and schedules and notes thereto and other financial data derived therefrom that is contained or incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (B) any trustee's statement of eligibility on Form T-1 (a "Form T-1") filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; and the Incorporated Documents (other than the financial statements and schedules and notes thereto and other financial data derived therefrom that is contained therein or omitted therefrom), as of the respective dates as of which they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder.
     None of the filing of the Registration Statement, the execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Company, the execution, issuance and delivery of the Notes by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or compliance by the Company with any of the provisions thereof will violate any statute, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America applicable to the Company.
     No consent or approval by any federal regulatory body, federal administrative agency or other federal governmental body of the United States of America or any state regulatory body, state administrative agency or other state governmental body of the State of New York is required under Applicable Laws on the part of the Company in connection with the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting
 
Agreement. As used in this opinion, the term "Applicable Laws" means those state laws of the State of New York and federal laws of the United States of America that, in our experience and without independent investigation, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement (provided that the term "Applicable Laws" shall not include federal or state securities or blue sky laws or any rules or regulations thereunder (including, without limitation, the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the respective rules and regulations thereunder) or any antifraud or similar laws).
     In acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions described in the first paragraph above, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and its internal counsel and independent public accountants and your representatives, at which conferences certain contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. We note, however, that we have not participated in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents and we have not independently verified, are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any statements contained or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except to the limited extent specified in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above. Based upon our participation in such conferences, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that:
     (1) the Registration Statement (including the information in the Prospectus that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it first became effective but that is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(1) of the 1933 Act Regulations, to be part of, and included in, the Registration Statement with respect to the Underwriters and the Notes), at March [], 2009, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     
     (2) the Preliminary Prospectus and the FWP, considered together (collectively, the "General Disclosure Package"), as of [] [A.M./P.M.] (New York City time), on March [], 2009, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or

     Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in the Underwriting Agreement.
     Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     (1) Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law.
     (2) Assuming the due authorization of the Notes by the Company, the Notes, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
 
Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, provided that we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law.
     We have considered the statements included in the Basic Prospectus under the captions "[Description of Debt Securities,]" and "[Plan of Distribution]" and in the Prospectus Supplement under the captions "[Description of the Notes]" and "[Underwriting]" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture, theNotes and the Underwriting Agreement. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
     In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) and (2) above, we have assumed that each party to the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the Notes (the "") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).

     We note that many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York[,][and] the federal laws of the United States of America [and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware].

However, in the course of our acting as counsel to you in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
     On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification, except as stated above:
 
     (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and
     (ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities:
     (a) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (b) at the Time of Sale, [[] [a.m.][p.m.] (New York City time)], the Disclosure Package contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or
     
     (c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement or as of the date hereof contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1.
