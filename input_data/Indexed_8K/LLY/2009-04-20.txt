Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 20, 2009, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the first quarter 2009, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a pro forma non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma non-GAAP net income and pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the first quarter of 2009 with the same period of 2008. Those measures include net sales, operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
In addition, the pro forma non-GAAP presentation assumes that our November 2008 acquisition of ImClone Systems Incorporated ("ImClone") was completed on January 1, 2008. We also quantified the impact on operating income of changes in foreign exchange rates from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we confirmed financial expectations for 2009. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2008 results and expected 2009 results, we adjusted 2008 earnings per share for the first quarter 2008 items described above and for the items described below for the balance of 2008. We presented 2008 as if the ImClone acquisition were completed on January 1, 2008.
 
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
 
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
In accordance with GAAP, we have provided pro forma results in order to help investors make meaningful comparisons of 2009 to 2008 results and 2009 expectations and identify underlying operating trends that might otherwise be masked by the inclusion of ImClone results beginning in late November 2008.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1

April 20, 2009
Date:
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2009.
Due to significant strategic actions taken by the company in 2008, financial results for 2008 are presented on both a reported basis and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized by the company during the period. Pro forma non-GAAP results exclude significant items described in the reconciliation tables and also assume the ImClone acquisition was completed January 1, 2008. The pro forma non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2009 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a pro forma non-GAAP basis.
First-Quarter Highlights
 
"Despite the downturn in the economy, in the first quarter of 2009, Lilly delivered strong financial results, with good underlying operational performance, aided in part by movements in exchange rates," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our revenue growth included solid volume-based gains, while our gross margin percentage benefited from a stronger U.S. Dollar. These results, in combination with prudent expense management, helped us to achieve operating leverage and robust earnings per share growth."
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
There were no significant items affecting net income in the first quarter of 2009; however, the reported earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 were favorably affected by significant items netting to $.05 per share. To reflect the impact of the ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred in January 1, 2008, first quarter 2008 pro forma earnings per share have been reduced by $.04 per share. These items are summarized below and in the table that follows:
First-Quarter Significant Items Affecting Reported Net Income
2008
 
First-Quarter Reported Results
In the first quarter, worldwide total revenue was $5.047 billion, an increase of 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008. This 5 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 7 percent increase due to higher volume and a 3 percent increase due to higher prices, partially offset by a 6 percent decline due to the impact of foreign exchange rates (numbers do not add due to rounding). Worldwide total revenue of $5.047 billion was comprised of product sales of $4.892 billion, an increase of 4 percent, and collaboration and other revenue of $155.2 million, an increase of 58 percent, primarily due to the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone acquisition. U.S. total revenue increased 13 percent to $2.872 billion. Total revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent to $2.175 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 6.9 percentage points, to 83.8 percent. This increase was due to the impact on international inventories from the decline in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a benefit to cost of sales.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent, to $1.529 billion. This decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a reduction in expenses related to U.S. marketing programs, partially offset by the impact of the ImClone acquisition and increased prasugrel pre-launch activities. Research and development expenses were $947.3 million, or 19 percent of revenue. Compared with the first quarter of 2008, research and development expenses grew 8 percent due primarily to the ImClone acquisition and increased late-stage clinical trial
 
and discovery research costs, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 2 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008.
In the first quarter of 2008, the company recognized a charge of $145.7 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges primarily related to the termination of the AIR Insulin program and a charge of $87.0 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the BioMS in-licensing arrangement.
Operating income increased 69 percent to $1.754 billion. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased 45 percent.
Other income (expense) decreased by $91.0 million, to a net expense of $70.7 million, primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as lower business development income.
The effective tax rate was 22 percent in the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2008, the company reported an aggregate income tax benefit of $8.0 million due to the recognition of a $210.3 million discrete benefit as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the IRS audit of the company's federal income tax returns for years 2001 through 2004.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $1.313 billion and $1.20, respectively, compared with first-quarter 2008 net income of $1.064 billion and earnings per share of $.97.
First-Quarter Pro Forma non-GAAP Results
Worldwide pro forma total revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was $5.047 billion, an increase of 3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008. This 3 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 5 percent increase due to higher volume and a 3 percent increase due to higher prices, partially offset by a 5 percent decline due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points, to 83.8 percent. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 3 percent, while research and development expenses increased 4 percent. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, were flat compared
 
with the first quarter of 2008. Operating income increased 38 percent to $1.754 billion. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased 19 percent. Other income (expense) decreased $25.4 million. The effective tax rate was 22 percent. Net income and earnings per share increased 37 percent and 36 percent, respectively, to $1.313 billion and $1.20 per share, primarily due to improved gross margins.
