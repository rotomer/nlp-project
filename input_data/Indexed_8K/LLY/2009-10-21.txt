Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 21, 2009, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the third quarter 2009, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a pro forma non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma non-GAAP net income and pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 with the same periods of 2008. Those measures include total revenue, operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
Table of Contents
In addition, the pro forma non-GAAP presentation assumes that the acquisition of ImClone Systems Incorporated ("ImClone") was completed on January 1, 2008, and includes adjustments to the first three quarters of 2008 for the ImClone acquisition. We also provide certain operating results, including earnings-per-share growth, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we provided financial expectations for 2009. We provided earnings per share, revenue, research and development expenses, and our effective tax rate expectations on both a GAAP basis and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2008 results and expected 2009 results, we adjusted 2008 earnings per share for the 2008 items described above and for the items described below for the balance of 2008. We presented 2008 as if the ImClone acquisition were completed on January 1, 2008.
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful
Table of Contents
information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
In accordance with GAAP, we have provided pro forma results in order to help investors make meaningful comparisons of 2009 results and expections to 2008 results and identify underlying operating trends that might otherwise be masked by the inclusion of ImClone results in a part of 2008.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports Solid Third-Quarter 2009 Results; Revises Full-Year 2009 EPS Guidance
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2009.
 
NM  not meaningful
Due to significant strategic actions taken by the company, financial results for 2009 and 2008 are presented on both a reported and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Pro forma non-GAAP results exclude significant items described in the reconciliation tables and also assume the ImClone acquisition was completed January 1, 2008. The pro forma non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2009 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a pro forma non-GAAP basis.
 
"Lilly continues to deliver very solid financial results," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our performance in the third quarter once again was driven by volume-based sales growth, improving gross margins and tight control of operating expenses, allowing us to deliver very attractive earnings growth. These results are evidence of the strength of our current operations as we implement our new operating model, streamline our organization and take measures to accelerate the flow of new medicines through our pipeline."
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
Third-Quarter Reported Results
In the third quarter of 2009, worldwide total revenue was $5.562 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008. This 7 percent revenue growth was comprised of an 8 percent increase due to higher volume and a 2 percent increase due to higher prices, partially offset by a 3 percent decline due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide total revenue of $5.562 billion was comprised of product sales of $5.385 billion, an increase of 6 percent, and collaboration and other revenue of $176.5 million, an increase of 51 percent, primarily due to the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone acquisition. U.S. total revenue increased 14
 
percent to $3.146 billion due to higher volume, higher prices, and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue. Total revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent to $2.416 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased demand.
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 3.3 percentage points, to 81.1 percent. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the decline in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the quarter, resulting in a benefit to cost of sales as compared to the third quarter of 2008.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 3 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008, to $1.702 billion. The increase was driven by the impact of the ImClone acquisition and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates and a reduction in advertising expenses in the U.S. market. Research and development expenses were $1.122 billion, or 20 percent of total revenue. Compared with the third quarter of 2008, research and development expenses grew 18 percent due primarily to the ImClone acquisition, increased late-stage clinical trial costs, and estimated costs to terminate arzoxifene clinical trials. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 9 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008.
In the third quarter of 2008, the company recognized a charge of $28.0 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the SGX Corporation acquisition.
In the third quarter of 2009, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges of $549.8 million. Of this charge, $424.8 million was for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the company's sale of its Tippecanoe, Indiana manufacturing site to Evonik Industries. In addition, the company is in advanced discussions or has settled with the attorneys general of the twelve states that were not part of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania settlement and filed separate Zyprexa-related claims against the company. In the third quarter of 2009, the company incurred a special pretax charge of $125.0 million related to these settlements and the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with the remaining states' claims.
In the third quarter of 2008, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges totaling $1.659 billion. These charges included $1.477 billion related to the
 
Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, the company recognized a charge of $182.4 million for asset impairments and restructuring primarily driven by the sale of its Greenfield, Indiana site.
Operating income in the third quarter of 2009 rose to $1.136 billion. In the third quarter of 2008, the company had reported an operating loss of $235.3 million, due to the charges associated with the EDPA settlement.
Other income (expense) decreased $69.4 million, to a net expense of $66.9 million, primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense associated with the ImClone acquisition.
The effective tax rate was 11.9 percent in the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to the tax benefit of the asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe site.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $941.8 million and $.86, respectively, compared with third-quarter 2008 net loss of $465.6 million and loss per share of $.43.
Third-Quarter Pro Forma non-GAAP Results
Worldwide pro forma total revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $5.562 billion, an increase of 5 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008. This 5 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 6 percent increase due to higher volume and a 2 percent increase due to higher prices, partially offset by a 3 percent decline due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 3.7 percentage points to 81.1 percent. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent, while research and development expenses increased 13 percent. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, grew 6 percent compared with the third quarter of 2008. Operating income increased 17 percent to $1.686 billion, due to improved gross margins. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased approximately 8 percent. Other income (expense) increased $9.4 million to a net expense of $66.9 million. The effective tax rate was 19.0 percent, down from 21.1 percent in the third quarter of 2008, reflecting a benefit for a cumulative adjustment in the forecasted effective tax rate for the year. Net income and earnings per share both increased 22 percent to $1.312 billion and $1.20 per
 
share, respectively, primarily due to volume-driven sales growth, improved gross margins and a lower tax rate. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, earnings per share would have increased approximately 11 percent.
Third-Quarter Significant Items Affecting Reported Net Income
The reported results for the third quarters of 2009 and 2008 were affected by significant items totaling $.33 and $1.47 per share, respectively. To reflect the impact of the ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, third quarter 2008 pro forma earnings per share have been reduced by $.06 per share. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the pro forma non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.

Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 3 percent, to $653.4 million, driven by the higher demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably impacted by the withdrawal of generic competition in Germany.

U.S. sales of Alimta increased 44 percent, to $215.5 million, due to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, to $246.4 million, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Gemzar sales totaled $331.8 million in the third quarter of 2009, a decrease of 25 percent from the third quarter of 2008. Sales in the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $191.0 million, due primarily to higher net effective selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S.
 
decreased 44 percent, to $140.8 million, due to reduced demand and lower prices as a result of the entry of generic competition in most major markets.
Evista
Evista sales were $259.5 million in the third quarter of 2009, a 2 percent decrease compared with the third quarter of 2008. U.S. sales of Evista increased 2 percent to $174.4 million, as a result of higher net effective selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent to $85.1 million, driven by the outlicensing of Evista in most European markets.
Humulin
Worldwide Humulin sales decreased 4 percent in the third quarter of 2009, to $260.4 million. U.S. sales increased 11 percent to $105.8 million, due primarily to higher net effective selling prices. Product demand in the U.S. continues to decline. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 12 percent, to $154.6 million, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices, partially offset by increased demand.
Forteo
Third-quarter sales of Forteo were $213.1 million, an 11 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2008. U.S. sales of Forteo increased 15 percent, to $135.1 million, driven by higher prices and the impact of wholesaler buying patterns.

Year-to-Date Results

Year-to-Date Significant Items Affecting Net Income
In addition to the significant items previously mentioned, net income for the first nine months of 2008 and 2009 was also affected by significant items occurring in the first half of 2008 and 2009. To reflect the impact of the ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, year-to-date 2008 pro forma earnings per share have been reduced by $.15 per share. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the pro forma non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
NM  not meaningful; numbers in the 2009 year-to-date column do not add due to rounding.
 
2009 Financial Guidance
The company revised certain aspects of its 2009 financial guidance. The company now expects its full-year 2009 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.00 on a reported basis, or $4.30 to $4.40 on a pro forma non-GAAP basis.
 
Numbers in the 2009 Expectations column do not add due to rounding
The company now expects low- to mid-single digit total revenue growth on a pro-forma basis and mid-single digit revenue growth on a reported basis.
The company continues to expect gross margin as a percent of total revenue to increase for the full year, driven primarily by the beneficial foreign exchange impact in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008. For the fourth quarter of 2009, the company expects a decrease in gross margin as a percent of total revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are still projected to show flat to low-single digit growth. Research and development expenses are still projected to grow in the high-single digits on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and in the low-double digits on a reported basis.
Other income is still expected to be a net loss of between $200 million and $250 million.
The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21 percent on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and approximately 20 percent on a reported basis. Capital expenditures are now expected to be less than $1.0 billion. The company still expects continued strong operating cash flow.
