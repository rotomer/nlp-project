Item 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 28, 2010, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the fourth quarter 2009, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2009 with the same periods of 2008. Those measures include the following, adjusted to exclude the effect of the items below (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1): total revenue; gross margin as a percent of total revenue; marketing, selling and administration expenses; research and development expenses; operating income; other income; income before taxes; income taxes; effective tax rate; net income; and earnings per share. The adjustments consist of:
 
In addition, the pro forma non-GAAP presentation assumes that the acquisition of ImClone Systems Incorporated ("ImClone") was completed on January 1, 2008, and includes adjustments to all four quarters of 2008 for the ImClone acquisition. We also provide certain operating results, including earnings-per-share growth, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we provided financial expectations for 2010, including earnings per share growth on non-GAAP basis.
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
 
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
In accordance with GAAP, we have provided pro forma results in order to help investors make meaningful comparisons of 2009 results to 2008 results and identify underlying operating trends that might otherwise be masked by the inclusion of ImClone results in a part of 2008.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

January 28, 2010
Date:
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009.
 
Due to significant strategic actions taken by the company, financial results for 2009 and 2008 are presented on both a reported and a pro forma non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Pro forma non-GAAP results exclude significant items described in the reconciliation tables and also assume the ImClone acquisition was completed January 1, 2008. The pro forma non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2010 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
 
"Lilly's financial results in the fourth quarter completed a year of strong operational performance, highlighted by volume-based revenue gains, improved gross margins and quality earnings growth," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. "In 2009, we delivered solid financial results even as we continued to implement a series of actions aimed at speeding innovation to patients and delivering greater value to our customers. In 2010, we are well-positioned, through our new operating structure and development center of excellence, to maximize the value of our portfolio of products worldwide and advance the promising medicines currently in our clinical pipeline."
Significant Events Over the Last Three Months
 
Fourth-Quarter Reported Results
In the fourth quarter of 2009, worldwide total revenue was $5.934 billion, an increase of 14 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This 14 percent revenue growth was comprised of an increase of 7 percent due to higher volume, 3 percent due to higher prices, and 3 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates (numbers do not add due to rounding). Total revenue in the U.S. increased 11 percent to $3.261 billion due to higher prices and wholesaler buying patterns. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 18 percent to $2.673 billion due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 6.6 percentage points, to 75.9 percent. Cost of sales increased by 57 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in gross margin was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the quarter, which substantially increased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, but substantially decreased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 13 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, to $1.953 billion. The increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Research and development expenses were $1.217 billion, or 21 percent of total revenue. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, research and development expenses grew 15 percent due primarily to the ImClone acquisition, increased incentive compensation and increased late-stage clinical trial costs. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 14 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.
In the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, the company recognized charges of $37.9 million and $80.0 million, respectively for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009 the
 
company recognized a charge of $90.0 million related to acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recognized pre-tax charges totaling $4.730 billion, or $4.46 per share after tax, related to the acquisition of ImClone Systems. This amount includes a charge of $4.685 billion for in-process research and development, as well as ImClone operating results subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux.
Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 rose to $1.205 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company had reported an operating loss of $3.256 billion, due to the in-process research and development charges associated with the acquisition of ImClone Systems.
Other income (expense) improved $13.4 million, to a net expense of $67.8 million, primarily due to the net loss on investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by lower net interest income.
The effective tax rate was 19.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recognized income tax expense of $292.0 million despite having a loss before income taxes of $3.337 billion because the in-process research and development charge related to the ImClone acquisition was not tax deductible. Also in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of $136.9 million, or $.13 per share, based upon the determination at final resolution of the agreement that a portion of the Zyprexa Eastern District of Pennsylvania settlement charge, taken in the third quarter of 2008, was tax deductible.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $915.4 million and $.83, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2008 net loss of $3.629 billion and loss per share of $3.31.
Fourth-Quarter Pro Forma non-GAAP Results
Worldwide pro forma total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $5.934 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This 13 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 6 percent increase due to higher volume, a 3 percent increase due to higher prices, and a 3 percent increase due to the impact of foreign exchange rates (numbers do not add due to
 
rounding). Gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 6.4 percentage points to 75.9 percent. Excluding the impact of the movement of foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the quarters, the gross margin as a percent of total revenue for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 was 79.2 percent and 77.7 percent, respectively. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12 percent, while research and development expenses increased 10 percent. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, grew 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income decreased 10 percent to $1.333 billion, due to lower gross margins. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased approximately 15 percent. Other income (expense) improved $41.5 million to a net expense of $67.8 million. The effective tax rate was 21 percent, up from 19.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income and earnings per share decreased 10 percent and 11 percent respectively. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, earnings per share would have increased approximately 16 percent.
Fourth-Quarter Significant Items Affecting Reported Net Income
The reported results for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 were affected by significant items totaling $.08 per share and $4.38 per share, respectively. To reflect the impact of the ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, fourth quarter 2008 pro forma earnings per share have been reduced by $.05 per share. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the pro forma non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
 
Full Year 2009 Reported Results
For the full-year 2009, worldwide total revenue increased 7 percent to $21.836 billion compared with 2008. This 7 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 7 percent increase due to higher volume and a 3 percent increase due to higher prices, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 12 percent to $12.294 billion due to higher prices and higher demand. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 1 percent to $9.542 billion due to increased demand, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices.
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 2.1 percentage points in 2009, to 80.6 percent. This increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the year, which decreased cost of sales in 2009, but increased cost of sales in 2008.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, to $6.892 billion. Research and development expenses were $4.327 billion in 2009, or 20 percent of total revenue. Compared with 2008, research and development expenses grew 13 percent due primarily to the ImClone acquisition and increased late-stage clinical trial costs. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 7 percent in 2009, compared with 2008.
In 2009 the company recognized a charge of $90.0 million related to acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation. In 2008, the company recognized charges of $4.835 billion for acquired in-process research and development associated with the ImClone and SGX acquisitions and the in-licensing agreements with BioMS and TransPharma.

Operating income in 2009 rose to $5.587 billion. In 2008, the company reported an operating loss of $1.282 billion due to the in-process research and development charges associated with the acquisition of ImClone Systems.
Other income (expense) in 2009 was a net expense of $229.5 million, compared to a net expense of $26.1 million in 2008, primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense resulting from the ImClone acquisition.
The effective tax rate was 19.2 percent for the full-year 2009. In 2008, the company recognized income tax expense of $764.3 million despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.308 billion. The in-process research and development charge recorded in 2008 related to the ImClone acquisition was not tax deductible.
For the full-year 2009, net income and earnings per share increased to $4.329 billion and $3.94, respectively, compared a full-year 2008 net loss of $2.072 billion and loss per share of $1.89.
 
Full-Year 2009 Pro Forma non-GAAP Results

Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 2.2 percentage points to 80.6 percent. Excluding the impact of the movement in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during 2009, the gross margin as a percent of total revenue for 2009 and 2008 was 79.7 percent and 79.1 percent, respectively. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent, while research and development expenses increased 8 percent. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, grew 5 percent compared with 2008. Operating income increased 15 percent to $6.370 billion due primarily to higher gross margins. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased approximately 14 percent. Other income (expense) improved $38.4 million to a net expense of $229.5 million. The effective tax rate for 2009 was 21 percent, up from 20.6 percent in 2008.

Full-Year 2009 Significant Items Affecting Net Income
In addition to the fourth-quarter 2009 and 2008 significant items previously mentioned, net income for the full-year 2009 and 2008 was also affected by significant items occurring in the first nine months of 2009 and 2008. To reflect the impact of the ImClone acquisition as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008, full-year 2008 pro forma earnings per share have been reduced by $.20 per share.
