ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
On July 22, 2010, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and sixmonth period ended June 30, 2010, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the second quarter and first six months of 2010, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In today's press release, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the first quarter and first six months of 2010 with the same periods of 2009. Those measures include operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
In addition, we quantified the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009, as well as the impact of U.S. health care reform on our second quarter 2010 results.
In today's press release, we provided financial expectations for 2010. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on a non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2009 results and expected 2010 results, we adjusted earnings per share for the first and second quarter 2010 and second quarter 2009 charges described above and for the items described below for 2009.
 
The items that we exclude when we provide non-GAAP results or non-GAAP expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item 9.01.

Exhibit 99.1
July 22, 2010
Date:
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2010.
Financial results for 2010 and 2009 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2010 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
 
"Lilly continued to deliver solid financial results in the second quarter, driven by volume-based revenue gains and ongoing cost-containment efforts that resulted in double-digit earnings growth," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. "We're pleased with these results and the opportunities they create. This strong financial performance enables us to fund our R&D pipeline of nearly 70 clinical stage assets and make strategic acquisitions in order to deliver an increased number of innovative medicines to patients in the future."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
Second-Quarter Reported Results
In the second quarter of 2010, worldwide total revenue was $5.749 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009. This 9 percent revenue growth was comprised of an increase of 5 percent due to higher volume, 2 percent due to higher prices and 1 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates (numbers do not add due to rounding). Total revenue in the U.S. increased 8 percent to $3.262 billion due to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volume. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 9 percent to $2.487 billion due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates outside the Euro zone, partially offset by lower prices. Second-quarter 2010 total revenue was reduced by approximately $70 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 9 percent, in-line with total revenue growth. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 82.2 percent, which was essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 3 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009, to $1.755 billion. The increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative expenses and company-wide cost containment efforts. Research and development expenses were $1.187 billion, or 21 percent of total revenue. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, research and development expenses grew 14 percent due primarily to increased costs of late-stage clinical trials and associated development milestones. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 7 percent compared with the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter of 2010, the company recognized a charge of $27.3 million for restructuring primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In the second quarter of 2009, the company incurred a special pretax charge of $105.0 million in connection with the settlement of several states' litigation claims involving Zyprexa.
Operating income in the second quarter of 2010 increased 18 percent to $1.755 billion, compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to revenue growing at a faster rate than cost of sales and operating expense, as well as lower asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges.
 
Other income (expense) improved $5.7 million, to a net expense of $18.4 million, primarily due to lower net interest expense.
The effective tax rate was 22.3 percent in the second quarter of 2010, compared with an effective tax rate of 21.1 percent in the second quarter of 2009, due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. at the end of 2009.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $1.349 billion and $1.22, respectively, compared with second-quarter 2009 net income of $1.159 billion and earnings per share of $1.06.
Second-Quarter non-GAAP Results
Operating income increased 12 percent to $1.782 billion, due to revenue growing at a higher rate than operating expenses. The effective tax rate was 22.5 percent, up from 22.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009. Net income and earnings per share both increased 11 percent to $1.367 billion and $1.24, respectively. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income and earnings per share would have increased approximately 9 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.02 and $.06 per share for the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
Year-to-Date Results
For the first six months of 2010, worldwide total revenue increased 9 percent to $11.234 billion, compared with the same period in 2009. Reported net income and earnings per share were $2.597 billion and $2.35, respectively. Net income and earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, were $2.664 billion and $2.41, respectively.
 
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.06 per share for the first six months of both 2010 and 2009 have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
