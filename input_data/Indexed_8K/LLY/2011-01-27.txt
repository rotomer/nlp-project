Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On January 27, 2011, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2010 with the same periods of 2009. Those measures include the following, adjusted to exclude the effect of the items below (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1): total revenue; gross margin as a percent of total revenue; marketing, selling and administration expenses; research and development expenses; operating income; other income; income before taxes; income taxes; effective tax rate; net income; and earnings per share. The adjustments consist of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We also provide certain operating results, including earnings-per-share growth, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we provided financial expectations for 2011, including earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP basis and revenue growth excluding the anticipated decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan and the incremental impact of U.S. health care reform.
 
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
 
 
SIGNATURES
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Lilly Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2010 Results, Provides 2011 Financial Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010.
 
Financial results for 2010 and 2009 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2011 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
 
 
 
 
"Lilly's fourth quarter results capped a year of solid financial performance in which we achieved volume-driven revenue growth along with good expense control. These results allowed us to deliver attractive earnings growth and a healthy dividend for our shareholders, while still investing in the research and development and business development activities that will enable us to bring the next generation of new medicines to patients," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. "As we begin 2011, we remain committed to our strategy of accelerating the flow of potential new medicines through our pipeline and are prepared to meet the challenges of patent expirations for several of our products."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth-Quarter Reported Results
In the fourth quarter of 2010, worldwide total revenue was $6.187 billion, an increase of 4 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. This 4 percent revenue growth was comprised of an
 
 
 
 
increase of 3 percent in volume and 2 percent due to higher prices, offset by a 1 percent decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent to $3.420 billion primarily due to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volume. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent to $2.767 billion due to increased demand, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices. Fourth-quarter 2010 total revenue was reduced by approximately $70 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 80.1 percent, reflecting an increase of 4.2 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold, which slightly decreased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, but significantly increased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue was also due to lower manufacturing costs.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent to $1.989 billion. Higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative expenses and company-wide cost containment efforts. Research and development expenses were $1.438 billion, or 23 percent of total revenue. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, research and development expenses grew 18 percent due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules, including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 8 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the company recognized a charge of $79.0 million for restructuring primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges of $37.9 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions, as well as a $90.0 million inprocess research and development charge associated with the in-licensing of an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, INCB28050, from Incyte Corporation.
 
 
 
 
Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 20 percent to $1.449 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, due primarily to increased gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses.
Other income (expense) improved $28.4 million, to a net expense of $39.4 million, primarily driven by increased other miscellaneous income and the net gain on equity investments, as well as lower net interest expense, partially offset by foreign exchange losses.
The effective tax rate was 17.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with an effective tax rate of 19.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects a full-year adjustment related to the extension of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. in late December.
Net income and earnings per share increased to $1.170 billion and $1.05, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2009 net income of $915 million and earnings per share of $0.83. The increases in net income and earnings per share were primarily due to higher operating income, improved other income and a lower effective tax rate.
Fourth-Quarter non-GAAP Results
Operating income increased 15 percent to $1.528 billion, due to increased gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. Net income increased 24 percent to $1.235 billion, while earnings per share increased 22 percent to $1.11. These increases were primarily driven by sales growth leveraged by gross margin improvements and the tax adjustment related to the extension of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income and earnings per share would have increased approximately 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $0.06 and $0.08 in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release. Numbers in the 2009 fourth quarter column do not add due to rounding.
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2010 Reported Results
For the full-year 2010, worldwide total revenue increased 6 percent to $23.076 billion compared with 2009. This 6 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 3 percent increase due to higher volume and a 2 percent increase due to higher prices, while the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible (numbers do not add due to rounding). Total revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent to $12.866 billion due to higher prices. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent to $10.210 billion due to increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. 2010 total revenue was reduced by approximately $230 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2010 to 81.1 percent. This increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, to $7.053 billion. Higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. were partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company-wide cost containment efforts. Research and development expenses were $4.884 billion in 2010, or 21 percent of total revenue. Compared with 2009, research and development expenses grew 13 percent due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules, including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. Total operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 6 percent in 2010, compared with 2009.
In 2010, the company recognized a charge of $50.0 million related to acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux Corporation. In 2009, the company recognized charges of $90.0 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation.
 
 
 
 
In 2010, the company recognized charges of $192.0 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions. In 2009, the company recognized charges totaling $692.7 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges.
Operating income in 2010 rose 17 percent to $6.530 billion compared to 2009, due primarily to increased gross margin, and lower asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges, partially offset by increased research and development expenses.
Other income (expense) in 2010 was a net expense of $5.0 million, compared to a net expense of $229.5 million in 2009, due primarily to net gains on equity investments, lower net interest expense, damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at the company's Enfield distribution center.
The effective tax rate was 22.3 percent for the full-year 2010. In 2009, the effective tax rate was 19.2 percent. The 2010 effective tax rate increased due to $85.1 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to U.S. health care reform. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe manufacturing site.
For the full-year 2010, net income and earnings per share increased to $5.070 billion and $4.58, respectively, compared to full-year 2009 net income of $4.329 billion and earnings per share of $3.94. The increases in net income and earnings per share were primarily due to higher operating income and improved other income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
Full-Year 2010 non-GAAP Results
Operating income increased 6 percent to $6.772 billion due primarily to increased gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 22.6 percent, up from 21.0 percent in 2009. Net income and earnings per share increased 8 percent and 7 percent, to $5.241 billion and $4.74, respectively. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income would have increased approximately 7 percent and earnings per share would have increased approximately 8 percent.

2011 Financial Guidance
The company is providing financial guidance for 2011. The company expects full-year 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.07 on a reported basis and $4.15 to $4.30 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's guidance includes the dilutive impact of the upfront fee and other anticipated expenses related to the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, but excludes potential restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce.
2011 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
The company expects total revenue growth will be flat to slightly increasing. The company anticipates that the impact of U.S. health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million. 2011 revenue guidance assumes the company maintains its patent exclusivity for U.S. Strattera sales, and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global Zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets, including the U.S. starting in October 2011, and the continued severe erosion of U.S. Gemzar sales. The company expects these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Humalog and animal health products. Excluding the anticipated decline in Zyprexa and Gemzar sales outside of Japan, and the incremental impact of U.S. health care reform, the company would expect 2011 revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single digits.
The company anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline approximately 2 percentage points.
 
 
 
 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits and include an estimated $150 million to $200 million in non-tax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Research and development expense growth is projected to be relatively flat.
Other income is expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5 percent.
Earnings per share are expected to decline and be in the range of $3.92 to $4.07 on a reported basis and $4.15 to $4.30 on a non-GAAP basis. Compared with 2010, the company anticipates that the Zyprexa and Gemzar sales erosion will lower EPS growth by approximately 15 to 17 percentage points, while the incremental impact of U.S. health care reform is expected to reduce EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points. The collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim is expected to reduce EPS growth by approximately 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points.
Cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of between $800 million and $900 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend.
