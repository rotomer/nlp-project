Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On April 18, 2011, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the first quarter 2011, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In today's press release, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the first quarter of 2011 with the same period of 2010. Those measures include operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we quantified the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010, as well as the impact of U.S. health care reform on our first quarter 2011 results.
In today's press release, we provided financial expectations for 2011, including the estimated impact of U.S. health care reform. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on a non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2010 results and expected 2011 results, we adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter 2011 and 2010 items described above and for restructuring charges in the last three quarters of 2010, also primarily related to severance costs from previously-announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce.
The items that we exclude when we provide non-GAAP results or non-GAAP expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports First-Quarter 2011 Results
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2011.
 
Financial results for 2011 and 2010 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2011 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
 
 
 
 
"Lilly started the year by delivering solid financial results as we continue to advance the next wave of potential new medicines in our pipeline," said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Growth in international markets and the strong performance of Cymbalta, Alimta and our animal health business drove volume-based revenue growth of six percent, despite a significant decline in Gemzar sales due to generic competition. This revenue growth allowed us to make necessary investments in research and development to address the challenges of upcoming patent expirations. We are on track to deliver on our 2011 headcount and expense reduction targets, as well as our goal of having at least ten potential new medicines in Phase 3 clinical development by the end of this year."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First-Quarter Reported Results
In the first quarter of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $5.839 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010. This 6 percent revenue growth was comprised of an increase of 5 percent in volume and 1 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Pricing changes had a negligible impact on revenue growth. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 1 percent to $3.076 billion primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by lower volume. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 13 percent to $2.763 billion due to increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. First-quarter 2011 total revenue was reduced by approximately $90 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 7 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 79.8 percent, reflecting an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared with the first quarter of 2010.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 10 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010 and included additional expenses related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 11 percent to $1.786 billion, driven by increased administrative expenses in the U.S., as well as higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S. Higher administrative expenses in the U.S. included approximately $45 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform, as well as higher litigation expenses. Research and development expenses were $1.124 billion, or 19.2 percent of total revenue. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, research and development expenses grew 8 percent due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trial costs.
In the first quarter of 2011, the company recognized a charge of $76.3 million for restructuring related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce, as well as a $388.0 million inprocess research and development charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. In the first quarter of 2010, the company recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges of $26.2 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions, as well as
 
 
 
 
a $50.0 million inprocess research and development charge associated with the in-licensing of Axiron from Acrux Ltd.
Operating income in the first quarter of 2011 decreased 21 percent to $1.285 billion, compared to the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to higher inprocess research and development charges, as well as higher restructuring charges and increased administrative expenses.
Other income (expense) was a net expense of $11.2 million, compared to $74.5 million of other income in the first quarter of 2010. The first quarter of 2010 included damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, as well as a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition.
The effective tax rate was 17.1 percent in the first quarter of 2011, compared with an effective tax rate of 26.9 percent in the first quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2010 was driven upward by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of the company's retiree health plan as part of U.S. health care reform, as well as the lapse of the U.S. R&D tax credit. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 reflects the tax benefit of the in-process research and development charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim as well as the extension of the R&D tax credit in the U.S.
Net income and earnings per share decreased to $1.056 billion and $0.95, respectively, compared with first-quarter 2010 net income of $1.248 billion and earnings per share of $1.13. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by lower operating income due to the restructuring and in-process research and development charges, partially offset by improved gross margin and a lower effective tax rate.
First-Quarter 2011 non-GAAP Results
Operating income increased 2 percent to $1.749 billion, due to increased gross margin, partially offset by increased administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Net income increased 6 percent to $1.375 billion, while earnings per share increased 5 percent to $1.24. These increases were primarily driven by increased gross margin and a lower net effective tax rate.
 
 
 
 
Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income and earnings per share would have increased approximately 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.29 and $.05 per share in the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
U.S. Health Care Reform Impact
U.S. health care reform reduced first-quarters 2011 and 2010 earnings per share by approximately $.10 and $.12 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. For the first quarter of 2011, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $90 million due to higher rebates and subsidies, and increased administrative expenses by approximately $45 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee. For the first quarter of 2010, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $60 million due to higher rebates, and increased tax expense by $85.1 million due to the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of the company's retiree health plan.
 
 
 
 
Zyprexa
In the first quarter of 2011, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.282 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Zyprexa increased 2 percent to $597.1 million, driven by higher prices, partially offset by lower volume. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 8 percent, to $684.8 million, driven primarily by higher volume, and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Cymbalta
For the first quarter of 2011, Cymbalta generated $908.8 million in revenue, an increase of 13 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Cymbalta increased 6 percent, to $691.1 million, driven by higher prices, and to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $217.6 million, an increase of 43 percent, driven primarily by higher demand resulting from recent launches in Japan and other international markets.
Alimta
For the first quarter of 2011, Alimta generated sales of $579.9 million, an increase of 10 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Alimta increased 5 percent, to $233.0 million,
 
 
 
 
driven by higher prices and higher demand, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, to $346.9 million, due to increased demand in Japan and other international markets.
Humalog
For the first quarter of 2011, worldwide Humalog sales increased 4 percent, to $525.4 million. Sales in the U.S. decreased 2 percent to $303.8 million, driven by lower net effective selling prices, partially offset by increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 13 percent to $221.6 million, driven by higher demand.
Cialis
Cialis sales for the first quarter of 2011 increased 6 percent to $434.4 million. U.S. sales of Cialis were $157.8 million in the first quarter, a 5 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2010, driven primarily by higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Sales of Cialis outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $276.6 million, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices.
Humulin
Worldwide Humulin sales increased 12 percent in the first quarter of 2011, to $289.8 million. U.S. sales increased 13 percent to $129.4 million, driven by increased demand resulting from the partnership with Walmart for Humulin ReliOn. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, to $160.4 million, driven by higher demand, partially offset by lower prices.
Evista
Evista sales were $266.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 10 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Evista increased 10 percent to $174.2 million, as a result of higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent to $92.0 million, driven by increased demand in Japan and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.
Forteo
First-quarter sales of Forteo were $216.1 million, an 11 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Forteo decreased 4 percent to $111.7 million due to decreased
 
 
 
 
demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, to $104.4 million, due primarily to increased demand resulting from the recent launch in Japan.
Gemzar
Gemzar sales totaled $156.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of 46 percent from the first quarter of 2010. Sales in the U.S. decreased 66 percent, to $59.3 million, due to the impact of generic competition. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 15 percent, to $96.8 million, due to generic competition in most major markets.
Strattera
During the first quarter of 2011, Strattera generated $138.7 million of sales, a decrease of 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010. U.S. sales decreased 16 percent to $86.6 million, due to lower net effective selling prices and lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, to $52.1 million, driven primarily by continued strong demand in Japan.
Erbitux
Lilly recognizes net royalties received from its Erbitux collaboration partners and revenue from manufactured product sold to these partners. For the first quarter of 2011, Lilly recognized total revenue of $104.0 million for Erbitux, an increase of 12 percent from the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to the timing of the sale of manufactured product to partners for development purposes.
Byetta
Lilly recognizes in revenue its 50 percent share of Byetta's gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and its sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to its partner, Amylin Pharmaceuticals. For the first quarter of 2011, Lilly recognized total revenue of $101.8 million for Byetta, a decrease of 12 percent.
Worldwide sales of Byetta were $165.4 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 12 percent decrease compared with the first quarter of 2010, due to competitive pressures in the U.S. and European markets. U.S. sales of Byetta decreased 15 percent to $128.0 million compared with the first quarter of 2010, while sales of Byetta outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent to $37.4 million.

TM
. Sales outside the U.S. increased 27 percent, to $167.4 million, driven by increased demand and the impact of the acquisition of certain Pfizer animal health assets in Europe.
 
 
 
 
2011 Financial Guidance
The company has updated certain elements of its 2011 financial guidance. The company still expects full-year 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 on a non-GAAP basis, but now expects earnings per share on a reported basis to be in the range of $3.86 to $4.01, due to the restructuring charge taken in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per share guidance excludes potential future restructuring charges.
2011 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
Due to the recent appreciation of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, the company now expects total revenue to grow in the low-single digits, an increase from the prior guidance of flat to slightly increasing total revenue growth. The company still anticipates that the impact of U.S. health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million. 2011 revenue guidance assumes the company maintains its patent exclusivity for U.S. Strattera sales, and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global Zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets, including the U.S. starting in October 2011, and the continued severe erosion of U.S. Gemzar sales. The company expects these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Humalog and animal health products.
Due to the recent appreciation of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, the company now anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline approximately 3 percentage points, a revision from prior guidance of an approximate 2 percentage point decline.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits and include an estimated $150 million to $200 million in non-tax deductible expense for the
 
 
 
 
mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Research and development expense growth is still projected to be relatively flat.
Other income is still expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million.
The tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21 percent on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20 percent on a reported basis. The estimated full year tax rates on both a non-GAAP and reported basis have decreased due to the benefits arising from the resolution of IRS audit matters. The estimated full year reported tax rate has also decreased from prior 2011 guidance due to the tax benefit of the in-process research and development charge associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration.
Cash flows are still expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of between $800 million and $900 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend.
