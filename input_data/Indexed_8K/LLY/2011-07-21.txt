Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On July 21, 2011, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the second quarter and first six months of 2011, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In today's press release, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the second quarter and first six months of 2011 with the same periods of 2010. Those measures include operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
 
 
 
In addition, we quantified the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from the second quarter of 2011 to the corresponding period of 2010, as well as the impact of U.S. health care reform on our results for the second quarter and first six months of 2011 and 2010.
In today's press release, we provided financial expectations for 2011, including the estimated impact of U.S. health care reform. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on a non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2010 results and expected 2011 results, we adjusted earnings per share for the first and second quarter 2011 and 2010 items described above and for restructuring charges in the last two quarters of 2010, also primarily related to severance costs from previously-announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce.
The items that we exclude when we provide non-GAAP results or non-GAAP expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports Second-Quarter 2011 Results
 
 
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2011.
 
Financial results for 2011 and 2010 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2011 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
 
 
 
 
"In the second quarter, Lilly once again achieved solid volume-driven revenue growth, despite the negative impact of generic versions of gemcitabine in the United States. Our financial results reflect the solid performance of many of our marketed products, as well as important investments we are making to expand our commercial opportunities and deliver the next wave of potential new medicines to patients," said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Key Lilly products continue to perform well, including Cymbalta, Cialis and our insulins. Exchange rates have also contributed to favorable sales comparisons. At the same time, we are investing for the company's future by supporting the launches of new medicines and new indications, as well as funding our R&D pipeline, which now boasts 70 potential new medicines in clinical development."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second-Quarter Reported Results
In the second quarter of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $6.253 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. This 9 percent revenue growth was comprised of increases of 5 percent in volume and 4 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Reflecting the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Gemzar in November 2010, price had a negligible impact on revenue growth. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 3 percent to $3.346 billion primarily due to increased volume, and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 17 percent to $2.906 billion due to increased volume and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. Second-quarter 2011 total revenue was reduced by approximately $110 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 6 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 80.4 percent, reflecting a decrease of 1.8 percentage points compared with the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in gross margin percent was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 12 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16 percent to $2.043 billion. Research and development expenses increased 6 percent to $1.261 billion, or 20.2 percent of total revenue. Total operating expense growth was driven by the recently-announced diabetes collaboration with
 
 
 
 
Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial costs, as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates and marketing efforts to support launches of new products and new indications. In addition, approximately $45 million of the increase in operating expense was due to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform.
In the second quarter of 2011, the company recognized a charge of $132.3 million for restructuring related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In the second quarter of 2010, the company recognized restructuring charges of $27.3 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions.
Operating income in the second quarter of 2011 was $1.589 billion, a decrease of 9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2010, due primarily to increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses, lower gross margin percent and higher restructuring charges.
Other income (expense) was a net expense of $57.6 million, compared to net expense of $18.4 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in second quarter 2011 expense was driven by the partial impairment of the acquired in-process research and development asset related to liprotamase, partially offset by gains on the disposition of investment securities.
The effective tax rate was 21.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, compared with an effective tax rate of 22.3 percent in the second quarter of 2010. This decrease was driven primarily by the lapse of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which resulted in an increase in the 2010 effective tax rate. The lower tax rate for the second quarter of 2011 reflects reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2010 and 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net income and earnings per share decreased to $1.197 billion and $1.07, respectively, compared with second-quarter 2010 net income of $1.349 billion and earnings per share of $1.22. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by lower operating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
 
 
 
 
Second-Quarter 2011 non-GAAP Results
Operating income decreased 3 percent to $1.721 billion, due to increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses and a lower gross margin percent. Net income decreased 4 percent to $1.316 billion, while earnings per share decreased 5 percent to $1.18. These decreases were primarily driven by lower operating income, partially offset by a lower net effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, earnings per share would have decreased approximately 4 percent.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.11 and $.02 per share in the second quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
Year-to-Date Results
For the first six months of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $12.092 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with the same period in 2010. Reported net income and earnings per share were $2.253 billion and $2.02, respectively. Net income and earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, were $2.691 billion and $2.42, respectively.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.40 per share for the first six months of 2011 and $.06 per share for the first six months of 2010 have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
 
 
 
U.S. Health Care Reform Impact
U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.12 and $.05 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in the first six months of 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.22 and $.17 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. For the first six months of 2011, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $200 million due to higher rebates and subsidies, and increased administrative expenses by approximately $90 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee. For the first six months of 2010, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $130 million due to higher rebates, and increased tax expense by $85 million due to the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of the company's retiree health plan.
Revenue Highlights  Reported
 
 
 
 
 
Zyprexa
In the second quarter of 2011, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.408 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Zyprexa increased 11 percent to $711.2 million, driven by higher prices. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 12 percent, to $697.1 million, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The company will lose patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in the U.S. in October 2011 and in most of Europe in September 2011. While it is difficult to predict the precise timing and magnitude of the impact on Zyprexa sales, the company expects the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in Zyprexa sales.
Cymbalta
For the second quarter of 2011, Cymbalta generated $1.003 billion in revenue, an increase of 16 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Cymbalta increased 7 percent, to $758.4 million, driven by increased demand, and to a lesser extent, higher net effective selling prices. Sales outside the U.S. were $245.0 million, an increase of 53 percent, driven primarily by higher demand in international markets, the 2010 launch in Japan, and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

For the second quarter of 2011, Alimta generated sales of $613.4 million, an increase of 11 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Alimta decreased 1 percent, to $251.9 million, driven by decreased volume.

Sales in the U.S. increased 14 percent to $341.6 million, driven by increased demand and higher prices.

U.S. sales of Cialis were $180.3 million in the second quarter, a 9 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2010, driven by increased demand and higher prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Sales of Cialis outside the U.S. increased 17 percent, to $297.0 million, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand.
Humulin
Worldwide Humulin sales increased 18 percent in the second quarter of 2011, to $311.8 million. U.S. sales increased 27 percent to $146.0 million, driven by increased demand for Humulin ReliOn, as well as higher prices for Humulin. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $165.8 million, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand.
Evista
Evista sales were $263.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 2 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Evista decreased 1 percent to $174.5 million, as a result of decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices.

Forteo
Second-quarter sales of Forteo were $231.0 million, a 10 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Forteo decreased 16 percent to $110.2 million due to decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, to $120.8 million, due primarily to increased demand resulting from the recent launch in Japan, and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Strattera
During the second quarter of 2011, Strattera generated $157.7 million of sales, an increase of 7 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. U.S. sales decreased 2 percent to $98.0 million, due to decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 28 percent, to $59.6 million, driven primarily by strong demand in international markets including Japan and, to a lesser extent the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.

Gemzar sales totaled $112.4 million in the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of 62 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Sales in the U.S. decreased 91 percent, to $17.2 million, due to the impact of generic competition following the patent expiry in November 2010. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 8 percent, to $95.3 million, due to generic competition in most major markets.
Erbitux
Lilly recognizes net royalties received from its Erbitux collaboration partners and revenue from manufactured product sold to these partners. For the second quarter of 2011, Lilly recognized total revenue of $100.1 million for Erbitux, a decrease of 4 percent from the second quarter of 2010.

TM
. Sales outside the U.S. increased 23 percent, to $171.2 million, driven by the impact of the acquisition of certain Pfizer animal health assets in Europe in the second quarter of 2010, increased demand, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
 
 
 
 
2011 Financial Guidance
The company has updated its 2011 financial guidance to reflect a number of factors, including continued strong volume growth in revenue, the appreciation of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, the prompt approvals of linagliptin in multiple markets and the partial impairment of the acquired in-process research and development asset related to liprotamase. As a result, the company has raised and narrowed its full-year 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. On a reported basis, the company now expects full-year 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95. Earnings per share guidance excludes potential future restructuring charges.
2011 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
The company now expects total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, an increase from the prior guidance of low-single digit growth. The company still anticipates that the impact of U.S. health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million. 2011 revenue guidance assumes the company maintains its patent exclusivity for U.S. Strattera sales, and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global Zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets, including the U.S. starting in October 2011, and the continued severe erosion of U.S. Gemzar sales. The company expects these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Humalog and animal health products.
The company now anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline between 2 and 3 percentage points.
 
 
 
 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now projected to grow in the high-single digits and still include an estimated $150 million to $200 million in non-tax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Research and development expense growth is now projected to be in the low single digits.
Other income is now expected to be a net expense of between $100 million and $175 million.
The tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21 percent on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 20 percent on a reported basis.
Cash flows are still expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures that are now expected to be between $700 million and $800 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend.
