Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On October 20, 2011, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In today's press release, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 with the same periods of 2010. Those measures include operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1):
 
 
 
In addition, we quantified the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from the third quarter of 2011 to the corresponding period of 2010, as well as the impact of U.S. health care reform on our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 and 2010.
In today's press release, we provided financial expectations for 2011, including the estimated impact of U.S. health care reform. In addition to providing earnings per share expectations on a GAAP basis, we provided earnings per share expectations on a non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2010 results and expected 2011 results, we adjusted earnings per share for the first, second, and third quarter 2011 and 2010 items described above and for restructuring charges in the last quarter of 2010, also primarily related to severance costs from previously-announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce.
The items that we exclude when we provide non-GAAP results or non-GAAP expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports Third-Quarter 2011 Results
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2011.
 
Financial results for 2011 and 2010 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in
 
 
 
 
order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2011 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
"In the third quarter Lilly continued to drive revenue growth for many key brands, including Cymbalta, Humalog, Forteo and Strattera, with strong growth also seen in animal health, Japan and China. This growth offset the continued erosion of Gemzar sales due to generic competition," said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "As we face the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, we are well-prepared as a company to meet the challenges before us. We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy and are focused on delivering the next wave of new medicines to patients in the coming years."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third-Quarter Reported Results
In the third quarter of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $6.148 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. This 9 percent revenue growth was comprised of increases of 4 percent in volume and 4 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Price had a negligible impact on revenue growth, reflecting the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Gemzar in November 2010. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 4 percent to $3.273 billion due to higher prices and increased volume. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 15 percent to $2.874 billion due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and increased volume. Third-quarter 2011 total revenue was reduced by approximately $130 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 3.1 percent to $4.810 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.2 percent, reflecting a decrease of 4.3 percentage points compared with the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in gross margin percent was due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange rates on inventories sold during the quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 10 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 13 percent to $1.918 billion. Research and development expenses increased 5 percent to $1.281 billion, or 20.8 percent of total revenue. Total operating expense growth was driven by the recently-announced diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial costs, as well as the effect of foreign
 
 
 
 
exchange rates. In addition, approximately $45 million of the increase in operating expense was due to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform.
In the third quarter of 2011, the company recognized a charge of $25.2 million for restructuring primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In the third quarter of 2010, the company recognized restructuring charges of $59.5 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions.
Operating income in the third quarter of 2011 was $1.586 billion, a decrease of 6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to lower gross margin percent and increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses.
Other income (expense) was a net expense of $83.4 million, compared to net expense of $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in third quarter 2011 expense was driven primarily by the partial impairment of an acquired in-process research and development asset related to Amyvid.
The effective tax rate was 17.7 percent in the third quarter of 2011, compared with an effective tax rate of 22.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010. The largest driver of the decrease in the effective tax rate was the recognition of a $45.4 million discrete benefit primarily as a result of the resolution of the IRS audit of the company's 2007 federal income tax return. For the full year 2011, the company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5 percent.
Net income and earnings per share decreased to $1.236 billion and $1.11, respectively, compared with third-quarter 2010 net income of $1.303 billion and earnings per share of $1.18. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by lower operating income and higher other expense, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
Third-Quarter 2011 non-GAAP Results
Operating income decreased 8 percent to $1.611 billion, due to lower gross margin percent and increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Net income decreased 7 percent to $1.254 billion, while earnings per share decreased 7 percent to $1.13. These decreases were primarily
 
 
 
 
driven by lower operating income and higher other expense, partially offset by a lower net effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, earnings per share would have decreased approximately 1 percent.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.02 and $.03 per share in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
Year-to-Date Results
For the first nine months of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $18.240 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with the same period in 2010. Reported net income and earnings per share were $3.489 billion and $3.13, respectively. Net income and earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, were $3.945 billion and $3.54, respectively.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.41 per share for the first nine months of 2011 and $.10 per share for the first nine months of 2010 have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
 
 
 
 
U.S. Health Care Reform Impact
U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.13 and $.02 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.35 and $.19 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. For the first nine months of 2011, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $330 million due to higher rebates and subsidies, and increased administrative expenses by approximately $135 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee. For the first nine months of 2010, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $160 million due to higher rebates, and increased tax expense by $85 million due to the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of the company's retiree health plan.
Revenue Highlights  Reported
 
Zyprexa
 
 
 
 
In the third quarter of 2011, Zyprexa sales totaled $1.182 billion, a decrease of 3 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Zyprexa decreased 7 percent to $563.2 million, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher net effective selling prices. Zyprexa sales in international markets increased 2 percent, to $619.1 million, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower volume. The company lost patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most of Europe in September 2011 and will lose exclusivity in the U.S. on October 23, 2011. While it is difficult to predict the precise timing and magnitude of the impact on Zyprexa sales, the company expects the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in Zyprexa sales.
Cymbalta
For the third quarter of 2011, Cymbalta generated $1.069 billion in revenue, an increase of 29 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Cymbalta increased 26 percent, to $809.5 million, driven by increased prices and higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $259.1 million, an increase of 42 percent, driven primarily by higher demand in international markets and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.

Humulin
Worldwide Humulin sales increased 8 percent in the third quarter of 2011, to $301.5 million. U.S. sales increased 18 percent to $142.6 million, driven primarily by higher prices for Humulin, as well as increased demand for Humulin ReliOn.

Forteo
Third-quarter sales of Forteo were $240.3 million, a 20 percent increase compared with the third quarter of 2010. U.S. sales of Forteo decreased 7 percent to $110.4 million due to decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 60 percent, to $129.9 million, due primarily to increased demand resulting from the recent launch in Japan, and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Strattera
During the third quarter of 2011, Strattera generated $153.2 million of sales, an increase of 20 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010.

2011 Financial Guidance
The company has updated certain elements of its 2011 financial guidance. The company has narrowed its full-year 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.30 to $4.35 per share. On a reported basis, the company now expects full-year 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.89 to $3.94. Earnings per share guidance excludes potential future restructuring charges.
2011 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
The company still expects total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits. The company still anticipates that the impact of U.S. health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million. 2011 revenue guidance assumes rapid and severe erosion of global Zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets, including the U.S. starting in October 2011, and the continued erosion of U.S. Gemzar sales. The company expects these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Humalog and animal health products.
The company still anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline between 2 and 3 percentage points.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the high-single digits and still include an estimated $150 million to $200 million in non-tax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Research and development expense growth is still projected to be in the low single digits.
Other income is now expected to be a net expense of between $175 million and $225 million.
 
 
 
 
The tax rate is now expected to be approximately 20 percent on a non-GAAP basis and approximately 19.5 percent on a reported basis.
Cash flows are still expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures that are now expected to be approximately $700 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend.
