Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On January 31, 2012, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, including, among other things, an income statement for those periods. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99.1
For the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011, the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011 with the same periods of 2010. Those measures include the following, adjusted to exclude the effect of the items below (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1): operating income, other income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share. The adjustments consist of:
 
 
 
 
In addition, we quantified the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results for the fourth quarters and full years of 2011 and 2010 to the corresponding periods of 2010, as well as the impact of U.S. health care reform on our results for the fourth quarters and full years 2011 and 2010.
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, we provided financial expectations for 2012, including earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP basis.
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
 
The company has consulted with its external auditors on the proper accounting treatment for the termination of its alliance with Amylin Pharmaceuticals in the fourth quarter of 2011. Given the complexity of this transaction, the company decided to proactively consult with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its accounting treatment. While the accounting treatment would not have any effect on the underlying cash flows or economics of the transaction, it is possible that this consultation could lead to material changes in Lilly's 2011 reported results as well as to its 2012 guidance. Lilly is working with the SEC to conclude this review process prior to filing its next Form 10-K.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Results
 
 
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011.
 
Financial results for 2011 and 2010 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2012 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. The company has consulted with its external auditors on the proper accounting treatment for the termination of Lilly's alliance with Amylin Pharmaceuticals. Given the complexity of this
 
 
 
 
transaction, Lilly decided to proactively consult with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its accounting treatment. While the accounting treatment would not have any effect on the underlying cash flows or economics of the transaction, it is possible that this consultation could lead to material changes in Lilly's 2011 reported results as well as to its 2012 guidance. Lilly is working with the SEC to conclude this review process prior to filing its next Form 10-K.
"Lilly's fourth quarter results not only reflect the impact of recent patent expirations, but also highlight the growth opportunities that will enable us to remain a strong and successful company in the years ahead," said John C. Lechleiter Ph.D., Lilly's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Although we anticipated the sales erosion in the fourth quarter resulting from the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in late October, I am encouraged by the strong performance of many other areas of our business. Products such as Cymbalta, Humalog, Humulin, Forteo, Alimta, Cialis and our animal health portfolio all demonstrated solid growth in the quarter, as did key regions including Japan and the emerging markets. With continued growth in these areas, along with a late-stage clinical pipeline that now features a dozen potential new medicines in Phase III, Lilly is well-positioned to deliver on our innovation-based strategy and create long-term value for all of our stakeholders."
Derica Rice, chief financial officer and executive vice president of global services, added, "By the end of 2011, Lilly had either met or exceeded several of the strategic goals we had previously outlined for the investment community. Since mid-2009, we have removed over $1 billion from our projected expense base and reduced more than 5,500 positions from our workforce through prudent cost containment and productivity initiatives. In addition, the 12 molecules currently in Phase III surpassed our goal of 10 by the end of 2011. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth-Quarter Reported Results
In the fourth quarter of 2011, worldwide total revenue was $6.047 billion, a decrease of 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. This 2 percent revenue decrease was comprised of a
 
 
 
 
decrease of 11 percent due to price, partially offset by an increase of 8 percent in volume and an increase of 1 percent due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in volume and reduction in price were significantly driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in October 2011 and the agreement with Prasco Laboratories to supply an authorized version of olanzapine. Total revenue in the U.S. decreased 4 percent to $3.281 billion due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa and, to a lesser extent, the loss of patent exclusivity in November 2010 for Gemzar. Total revenue outside the U.S. remained flat at $2.765 billion due to increased volume and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, offset by lower prices. Fourth-quarter 2011 total revenue was reduced by approximately $80 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin decreased 4.6 percent to $4.725 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.1 percent, reflecting a decrease of 2.0 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in gross margin percent was due to lower sales of Zyprexa, and to a lesser extent Gemzar, following patent expirations.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 7 percent to $2.133 billion driven primarily by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as approximately $45 million due to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers' fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Research and development expenses decreased 6 percent to $1.355 billion, or 22 percent of total revenue, as fourth quarter 2011 ongoing expenses related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim and other late-stage clinical trial costs were more than offset by higher fourth quarter 2010 charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the company recognized a charge of $167.6 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges, including a special charge of $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris and $82.6 million related to previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $79.0 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions.
 
 
 
 
Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.069 billion, a decrease of 26 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to lower gross margin; increased asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges; and increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower research and development expenses.
Other income (expense) was a net expense of $26.8 million, compared to net expense of $39.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in fourth quarter 2011 other expense was driven by lower foreign exchange rate losses.
The effective tax rate was 17.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with an effective tax rate of 17.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflects the deductibility of asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges during the quarter, while the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D credit in that quarter.
Net income and earnings per share decreased to $858.2 million and $.77, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2010 net income of $1.170 billion and earnings per share of $1.05. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by lower operating income.
Fourth-Quarter 2011 non-GAAP Results
On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2011 operating income decreased 19 percent to $1.236 billion, due to lower gross margin and increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. The effective tax rate was 19.9 percent. Net income and earnings per share both decreased 22 percent, to $968.9 million and $.87, respectively. These decreases were primarily driven by lower operating income. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, earnings per share would have decreased approximately 23 percent.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.10 and $.06 per share in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2011 Reported Results
For the full-year 2011, worldwide total revenue increased 5 percent to $24.286 billion compared with 2010. This 5 percent revenue growth was comprised of a 6 percent increase due to higher volume and a 2 percent increase due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices. The increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa and Gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 1 percent to $12.977 billion due to higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. Total revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent to $11.309 billion due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. 2011 total revenue was reduced by approximately $410 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform.
Gross margin increased 2.7 percent to $19.219 billion in 2011. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2011 to 79.1 percent. This decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011, but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010. Patent expirations for Zyprexa and Gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 8 percent in 2011. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12 percent to $7.880 billion. Research and development expenses increased 3 percent to $5.021 billion, or 21 percent of total revenue. Total operating expense growth was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, including late-stage clinical trial costs, as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates. In addition, approximately $180 million of the increase in operating expense was due to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers' fee associated with U.S. health care reform.
 
 
 
 
In 2011, the company recognized a charge of $388.0 million related to acquired in-process research and development associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In 2010, the company recognized charges of $50.0 million for acquired in-process research and development associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux Corporation.
In 2011, the company recognized charges of $401.4 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges, including a charge of $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure and global workforce and a special charge of $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2010, the company recognized restructuring charges of $192.0 million, primarily related to the previously announced strategic actions.
Operating income in 2011 decreased 15 percent to $5.528 billion compared to 2010, due primarily to increased in-process research and development charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as increased late-stage clinical trial costs, restructuring and other special charges, and lower gross margin percent.
Other income (expense) in 2011 was a net expense of $179.0 million, compared to net expense of $5.0 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 net expense was driven primarily by the partial impairment of the acquired in-process research and development assets related to liprotamase and Amyvid
TM
in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany.
The effective tax rate was 18.7 percent in 2011, compared with 22.3 percent in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 decreased due to the tax benefit on the in-process research and development charge associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes collaboration, as well as a benefit of $85.3 million primarily from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005-2007, along with certain matters related to 2008-2009. Additionally, the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of U.S. health care reform.
For the full-year 2011, net income and earnings per share decreased to $4.348 billion and $3.90, respectively, compared to full-year 2010 net income of $5.070 billion and earnings per share of $4.58. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily due to lower operating income and higher other expense, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
 
 
 
 
Full-Year 2011 non-GAAP Results
Operating income decreased 7 percent to $6.318 billion due primarily to increased marketing, selling and administrative expenses and lower gross margin percent. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.0 percent. Net income and earnings per share decreased 6 percent and 7 percent, to $4.913 billion and $4.41, respectively. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, both operating income and earnings per share would have decreased approximately 6 percent.
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.52 and $.16 for 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.
 
Numbers in the 2011 full-year column do not add due to rounding.
U.S. Health Care Reform Impact
U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.10 and $.05 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. U.S. health care reform reduced earnings per share in 2011 and 2010 by approximately $.45 and $.24 per share, respectively, on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. In 2011, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $410 million due to higher rebates and subsidies, and increased
 
 
 
 
administrative expenses by approximately $180 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee. In 2010, U.S. health care reform reduced revenue by approximately $230 million due to higher rebates, and increased tax expense by $85.1 million due to the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of the company's retiree health plan.
Revenue Highlights  Reported
 
 
 
 
 
Zyprexa
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Zyprexa sales totaled $749.6 million, a decrease of 44 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 due to patent expirations. U.S. sales of Zyprexa decreased 56 percent to $293.9 million. Despite a decline in demand for branded Zyprexa, U.S. volume increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine to Prasco. This volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to authorized olanzapine and branded Zyprexa. Zyprexa sales in international markets decreased 32 percent, to $455.7 million, driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity in most major markets outside of Japan during 2011, partially offset by increased demand in Japan.
For the full year of 2011, worldwide Zyprexa sales decreased 8 percent to $4.622 billion. U.S. Zyprexa sales for 2011 were $2.165 billion, a 13 percent decrease due to the loss of patent exclusivity in October 2011. Zyprexa sales outside the U.S. were $2.457 billion, a 3 percent decrease driven by the loss of patent exclusivity in most major markets outside of Japan during 2011, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan.

2012 Financial Guidance
The company has reconfirmed its 2012 financial guidance and expects full-year earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20 on both a reported and non-GAAP basis.
2012 Earnings Per Share Expectations:
 
Numbers in the 2011 full-year column do not add due to rounding.
The company anticipates 2012 revenue of between $21.8 and $22.8 billion. This includes an expected decline of over $3 billion in Zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of Japan. The reduction in revenue due to Zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog, Humulin and Forteo, as well as continued growth of newer products such as Effient, Axiron and Tradjenta. The company also anticipates continued strong, double-digit revenue growth from its Elanco Animal Health business.
