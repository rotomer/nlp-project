For purposes of this Section 1.8 and Section 1.9, "public disclosure" means disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. No adjournment of an annual meeting or announcement thereof shall commence a new time period for the giving of a timely notice as described above.

For purposes of this Section 1.8 and Section 1.9, the term "beneficial ownership" shall have the meaning specified in IND. CODE 23-1-20-3.5 as in effect on October 18, 2010;
(d) A proposing shareholder shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in the notice shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects (i) as of the record date for the meeting and (ii) as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

(f) The requirements of this Section 1.8 shall apply to any item of business to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders (other than the election of directors and any proposal properly made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act) regardless of whether the business is presented to shareholders directly at the meeting or by means of an independently financed proxy solicitation. The requirements of this Section 1.8 are included to provide the Corporation notice of a shareholder's intention to bring business before an annual meeting and shall not be construed as imposing upon any shareholder the requirement to seek approval from the Corporation as a condition precedent to bringing any such business before an annual meeting.
 
(g) At any special meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

SECTION 2.0. The property, affairs and business of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.
General Powers.
SECTION 2.1. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be sixteen (16), which number may be either increased or diminished by resolution adopted by not less than a majority of the directors then in office; provided that the number may not be diminished below nine (9) and no reduction in number shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. In the event that the holders of shares of preferred stock become entitled to elect two directors, the number of directors and the minimum number of directors shall be increased by two. Neither ownership of stock of the Corporation nor residence in the State of Indiana shall be required as a qualification for a director.
Number and Qualifications.
SECTION 2.2. . The directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible. Except as provided in Article 9 of the Articles of Incorporation fixing one, two, and three year terms for the initial classified board, each class of directors shall be elected for a term of three (3) years. In the event of vacancy, either by death, resignation, or removal of a director, or by reason of an increase in the number of directors, each replacement or new director shall serve for the balance of the term of the class of the director he or she succeeds or, in the event of an increase in the number of directors, of the class to which he or she is assigned. All directors elected for a term shall continue in office until the election and qualification of their respective successors, their death, their resignation in accordance with Section 2.6, their removal in accordance with Section 2.7, or if there has been a reduction in the number of directors and no successor is to be elected, until the end of the term. The classes and terms of the directors shall not be governed by IND. CODE 23-1-33-6(c).
Classes of Directors and Terms
SECTION 2.3. Subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to elect any directors voting separately as a class or series, at each annual meeting of shareholders, the directors to be elected at the meeting shall be chosen by the majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at the meeting, provided a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, then directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote, provided a quorum is present. For purposes of this
Election of Directors.
 
Section 2.3, a "majority of votes cast" shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election. If a nominee fails to receive the required vote and is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Directors and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Directors and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Directors and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Directors and Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If an incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, or if a nominee fails to receive the required vote and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 of the Amended Articles of Incorporation or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 of the Amended Articles of Incorporation and Section 2.2.
The election of directors by the shareholders shall be by written ballot if directed by the chairman of the meeting or if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
Any vacancy on the Board of Directors shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors.
If the holders of preferred stock are entitled to elect any directors voting separately as a class or series, those directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of preferred stock entitled to vote in the election at the meeting, provided a quorum of the holders of shares of preferred stock is present.
SECTION 2.4. .
Meetings of Directors
(a) Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors, the annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at the place of and immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, for the purpose of organization, the election of officers and the transaction of such other business as properly may come before the meeting. No notice of the meeting need be given, except in the case an amendment to the Bylaws is to be considered.
 
(b) Regular Meetings. The Board of Directors by resolution may provide for the holding of regular meetings and may fix the times and places (within or outside the State of Indiana) at which those meetings shall be held. Notice of regular meetings need not be given except when an amendment to the Bylaws is to be considered. Whenever the time or place of regular meetings shall be fixed or changed, notice of this action shall be mailed promptly to each director not present when the action was taken, addressed to the director at his or her residence or usual place of business.
(c) Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board and shall be called by the Secretary at the request of any three (3) directors. Except as otherwise required by statute, notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director at his or her residence or usual place of business at least three (3) days before the day on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to the director at such place by facsimile transmission or other form of electronic communication or personally delivered, not later than the day before the day on which the meeting is to be held. The notice shall state the time and place (which may be within or outside the State of Indiana) of the meeting but, unless otherwise required by statute, the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws, need not state the purposes thereof.
Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director, however, who shall attend the meeting, or who shall waive notice thereof, before, at the time of, or after the meeting, in a writing signed by the director and delivered to the Corporation. No notice need be given of any meeting at which every member of the Board of Directors shall be present.
SECTION 2.5. A majority of the actual number of directors established pursuant to Section 2.1, from time to time, shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business except the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors under Section 2.3 or voting on a conflict of interest transaction under Section 2.12. The act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by the Bylaws. Under the provisions of Article 13 of the Articles of Incorporation, certain actions by the Board of Directors therein specified require not only approval by the Board of Directors, but also approval by a majority of the Continuing Directors, as therein defined. Any or all directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting may simultaneously hear each other, and participation in this manner shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. No notice of any adjourned meeting need be given.
Quorum and Manner of Acting.
SECTION 2.6. . Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary. Unless otherwise specified in the written notice, the resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof and unless otherwise specified in it, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. In addition, a director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast at an annual meeting of shareholders at which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected shall tender his or her resignation subject to acceptance in accordance with Section 2.3.
Resignations
 
SECTION 2.7. . Any director, other than a director elected by holders of preferred stock voting as a class, may be removed from office at any time but only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty (80) percent of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined in Article 13 of the Articles of Incorporation), voting together as a single class.
Removal of Directors

The determination of the Eligible Person's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such request, advise the Board in writing of the Eligible Person's request.
(b) An Eligible Person's entitlement to indemnification under this Article shall be determined in one of the following methods, such method to be selected by the Board of Directors, regardless of whether there are any Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined): (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board; (ii) by a written opinion of Special Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (A) a Change in Control shall have occurred and the Eligible Person so requests or (B) a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested
 
Directors so directs; (iii) by the shareholders of the Corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board, presents the issue of entitlement to the shareholders for their determination); or (iv) as provided in subsection (d).
(c) In the event the determination of entitlement is to be made by Special Counsel, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Special Counsel, but only Special Counsel to which the Eligible Person does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Eligible Person shall select such Special Counsel, but only Special Counsel to which a majority of the Disinterested Directors does not reasonably object.
(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Eligible Person shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification (with respect to actions or failures to act occurring prior to such Change in Control) upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with subsection (a), and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under subsection (c) to determine entitlement shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the Eligible Person shall be deemed to be, and shall be, entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses unless (i) the Eligible Person misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of an Eligible Person to indemnification or create a presumption that the Eligible Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Eligible Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the Eligible Person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere

(f) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts incurred by the Eligible Person within ten (10) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (i) the Eligible Person misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (ii) such indemnification is
