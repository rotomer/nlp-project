Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On April 25, 2012, we issued a press release announcing our results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, including, among other things, an income statement for that period. In addition, on the same day we held a teleconference for analysts and media to discuss those results. The teleconference was web cast on our web site. The press release and related financial statements are attached to this Form 8-K as .
Exhibit 99
For the first quarter of 2012, the press release attached as Exhibit 99 includes a non-GAAP presentation of our results. We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and earnings per share, that differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In the press release attached as Exhibit 99, we used non-GAAP financial measures in comparing the financial results for the first quarter of 2012 with the same period of 2011. Those measures include the following, adjusted to exclude the effect of the items below (described in more detail in the press release attached as Exhibit 99): operating income, income before taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share. The adjustments consist of:
 
 
 
 
In the press release attached as Exhibit 99, we provided financial expectations for 2012, including earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP basis. In order to provide additional insight into the earnings-per-share growth comparison between 2011 results and expected 2012 results, we adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter 2012 and 2011 items described above and for the following:
 
 
The items that we exclude when we provide adjusted results or adjusted expectations are typically highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that could have a substantial impact on our reported operations for a period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets.
Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. For the reasons described above for use of non-GAAP measures, our prospective earnings guidance is subject to adjustment for certain
 
future matters, similar to those identified above, as to which prospective quantification generally is not feasible.
The information in this Item 2.02 and the press release attached as Exhibit 99 are considered furnished to the Commission and are not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Lilly Reports Solid Start to the Year With First-Quarter 2012 Results, Raises EPS Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2012.
 
Financial results for 2012 and 2011 are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 
 
 
 
(GAAP) and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. Non-GAAP results exclude the items described in the reconciliation tables. The non-GAAP results are presented in order to provide additional insights into the underlying trends in the company's business. The company's 2012 financial guidance is also being provided on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis.
"Lilly's financial results in the first quarter represent a solid start to the year and support our decision to increase our 2012 EPS guidance. Notwithstanding the negative effect of the expiration of the Zyprexa patent in the U.S. and many international markets, Lilly demonstrated strong underlying growth in other products and key regions; specifically, Cymbalta, Forteo, Effient, diabetes care and our animal health portfolio, as well as our fast-growing affiliate in China," said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We continue to invest appropriately in our pipeline, with 12 potential new medicines now in Phase III clinical trials. We strongly believe that our innovation-based strategy will enable Lilly to return to steady growth following a period of multiple patent expirations."
Key Events Over the Last Three Months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First-Quarter Reported Results
In the first quarter of 2012, worldwide total revenue was $5.602 billion, a decrease of 4 percent compared with the first quarter of 2011. This 4 percent revenue decline was comprised of a decrease of 7 percent due to lower volume, partially offset by an increase of 4 percent in prices. Foreign exchange rates had a negligible impact. (Numbers do not add due to rounding). The decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, partially offset by volume gains for other products. Total revenue in the U.S. remained relatively flat at $3.085 billion due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, offset by increased prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volume in other products. Total revenue outside the U.S. decreased by 9 percent to $2.517 billion, driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, partially offset by increased volume in other products including Cymbalta, Forteo, Humalog, Efient and the animal health portfolio, as well as a 41 percent revenue increase in China.
Gross margin decreased 5.5 percent to $4.404 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.6 percent, reflecting a decrease of 1.2 percentage points compared with the first quarter of 2011. The decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to lower sales of Zyprexa following its patent expiration in most major markets, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of research and development, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, increased 3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2011. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 3 percent to $1.848 billion, driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim and increased expense for newer pharmaceutical and animal health products, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. Research and development expenses increased 2 percent to $1.151 billion, or 20.6 percent of total revenue, driven by expenses related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim and other late-stage clinical trial costs.
In the first quarter of 2012, the company recognized an asset impairment, restructuring and other special charge of $23.8 million primarily related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In the first quarter of 2011, the company recognized a charge of $76.3 million for restructuring related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that the company is taking to reduce its cost structure, as well as a $388.0 million inprocess research and development (IPR&D) charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.
 
 
 
 
Operating income in the first quarter of 2012 was $1.381 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to the prior year IPR&D charge mentioned previously, partially offset by decreased revenue as a result of the loss of Zyprexa patent exclusivity.
Other income (expense) was a net expense of $46.0 million, compared with net expense of $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in other expense was driven by the recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of a gain on an equity investment and an insurance recovery, partially offset by increased interest income in the first quarter of 2012.
The effective tax rate was 24.3 percent in the first quarter of 2012, compared with an effective tax rate of 17.1 percent in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by the tax benefit in 2011 of the IPR&D charge described above, as well as the expiration of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. at the end of 2011.
Net income and earnings per share decreased to $1.011 billion and $0.91, respectively, compared with first-quarter 2011 net income of $1.056 billion and earnings per share of $0.95. The decreases in net income and earnings per share were primarily due to lower gross margin and the increase in the effective tax rate, partially offset by the IPR&D charge in the first quarter of 2011.
First-Quarter 2012 non-GAAP Results
On a non-GAAP basis, first quarter 2012 operating income decreased 20 percent to $1.405 billion, due to lower gross margin resulting from the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets and, to a lesser extent, increased operating expenses. The effective tax rate was 24.4 percent, compared with 20.9 percent in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011, as well as the inclusion of a discrete item in the first quarter of 2012 due to changes in estimates concerning certain prior-year tax items. Net income and earnings per share decreased 25 and 26 percent, to $1.027 billion and $0.92, respectively. These decreases were driven primarily by lower operating income.
 
 
 
 
For purposes of non-GAAP reporting, items totaling $.01 and $.29 per share in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, have been excluded. For further detail, see the reconciliation below as well as the footnotes to the non-GAAP income statement later in this press release.

Zyprexa
In the first quarter of 2012, Zyprexa sales totaled $562.7 million, a decrease of 56 percent compared with the first quarter of 2011 due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. and most major international markets outside of Japan.

Zyprexa sales in international markets decreased 47 percent, to $359.9 million.

Worldwide Humulin sales increased 6 percent in the first quarter of 2012, to $307.7 million. U.S. sales increased 20 percent to $155.1 million, driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, to $152.6 million, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, lower prices, and decreased volume.
Forteo
First-quarter sales of Forteo were $271.3 million, a 26 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. U.S. sales of Forteo increased 9 percent to $121.9 million due to higher prices, largely offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, to $149.4 million, due primarily to increased demand in Japan.
Evista
Evista sales for the first quarter of 2012 decreased 4 percent to $256.2 million. U.S. sales of Evista decreased 1 percent to $171.7 million, driven by decreased demand, largely offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 8 percent to $84.5 million, driven by lower volume in Japan.

During the first quarter of 2012, Strattera generated $158.9 million of sales, an increase of 15 percent compared with the first quarter of 2011. U.S. sales increased 21 percent to $104.8 million, due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to $54.1 million, driven primarily by higher demand, partially offset by lower prices.

U.S. sales grew 33 percent, to $269.6 million, due primarily to increased demand and the favorable impact from customer buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 32 percent, to $221.1 million, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen animal health assets in Europe.
 
 
 
 
2012 Financial Guidance
The company has raised its 2012 earnings per share guidance and now expects full-year 2012 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.14 to $3.29 on a reported basis and $3.15 to $3.30 on a non-GAAP basis. All other elements of the company's 2012 financial guidance remain unchanged.
 
Numbers in the 2011 full-year column do not add due to rounding.
The company anticipates 2012 revenue of between $21.8 and $22.8 billion. This includes an expected decline of over $3 billion in Zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of Japan. The reduction in revenue due to Zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog, Humulin and Forteo, as well as continued growth of newer products such as Effient, Axiron and Tradjenta. The company also anticipates continued strong, double-digit revenue growth from its Elanco Animal Health business. Both Japan and Emerging Markets are expected to post continued strong underlying volume growth; however, overall revenue growth in these markets in 2012 will be adversely affected by anticipated pricing actions in Japan and by the expected impact of patent expirations, including Zyprexa, in some emerging market countries.
The company anticipates that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent in 2012.
As a result of ongoing productivity efforts, the company expects to keep 2012 operating expenses essentially flat compared to 2011. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are expected to decline and be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. Research and development expense is expected to be flat to increasing and in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.3 billion.
 
 
 
 
Other income and deductions is expected to be in a range between net expense of $50 million and net income of $100 million in 2012.
The 2012 tax rate is expected to be approximately 21 percent, and assumes the extension of the R&D tax credit for the full year 2012.
Operating cash flows in 2012 are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and the company's current dividend.
