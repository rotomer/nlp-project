Exhibit 99
 
Baltimore, Maryland -- October 22, 2003 -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported record net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2003: net revenues were $457.7 million, up 25% from $366.3 million in the September 2002 quarter, net earnings were $66.6 million, up 47% from $45.4 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share were $0.93, up 41% from $0.66 a year ago.
As previously announced, these results include a litigation award pre-tax charge of $17.5 million (which decreased reported earnings by $0.13 per diluted share) and a $10.9 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our mortgage servicing operations (which increased reported earnings by $0.10 per diluted share when combined with the earnings of that discontinued operation). Excluding these items, the Company's net earnings would have been $68.7 million, up 50% from the September 2002 quarter, while diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96, up 43%. A reconciliation to GAAP earnings is included as Exhibit A.
The Company also commenced expensing its stock-based compensation this quarter, recognizing stock option expense of $2.7 million (which decreased reported earnings by $0.02 per diluted share).
Assets under management increased to a record $236.9 billion, up 9% from $216.6 billion in June and up 34% from $176.6 billion reported a year ago.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"This was a quarter that truly showed our strengths. Asset management, private client and investment banking had strong results. Our theme has been 'Balance,' which has served us well in declining markets and continues to serve us well in stronger markets. We have said that stronger equity markets could have a meaningful, positive effect on our profits: this quarter is an indication of what that positive effect can be.
"Our ability to attract new client assets and to grow our current assets continues to be Legg Mason's primary strength. Our equity assets under management have increased by 56% in the last year and now represent 36% of our total assets under management, up from 31% of the total a year ago. Our fixed income assets increased by 24% year over year. However, clearly the most important fact is that our total assets under management grew 34% over the last 12 months, from $177 billion to $237 billion."

Consolidated Results for the Quarter
Investment advisory and related fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 totaled $281.8 million, up 39% from $203.1 million in the September 2002 quarter, primarily due to an increase in investment management fees at Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Legg Mason Funds/Capital Management and Royce, as well as substantial increases in proprietary fund distribution fees, reflecting the improved equity market conditions from a year ago and the continued strong performance of these managers. Investment advisory and related fees represented 62% of the Company's consolidated net revenues, up from 55% a year ago.
Revenues from retail and institutional securities brokerage, which includes commissions plus principal transaction revenues, totaled $125.1 million, up 4% from $120.3 million a year ago. Commissions were up 6%, to $83.7 million, primarily reflecting an increased volume of retail commissions; commissions represented 18% of the Company's consolidated net revenues, down from 22% a year ago. Principal transaction revenues were up 1%, to $41.4 million, as increased NASDAQ and retail fixed income transaction volume was largely offset by decreased institutional taxable fixed income transaction volume.
Investment banking revenues were $39.2 million, up 40% from $28.1 million a year ago, due to substantial increases in retail and institutional selling concessions and management fees from public offerings as well as corporate advisory fees. Public finance revenues were essentially unchanged.
Net interest profit was $5.0 million, down 15% as a result of lower interest rates, while other revenues were $6.5 million, down 26% as a result of losses on firm investments.
The pre-tax profit margin on continuing operations was 21.1% in the current quarter, up from 20.0% a year ago, and the effective tax rate was 38.6%, versus 37.3%. The annualized return on equity was 17.5%, versus 16.7%.
As of September 30, 2003, stockholders' equity was $1.395 billion, up 19% from $1.168 billion a year ago; book value per share was up 18%, to $20.52 from $17.40. The Company had 68.0 million shares outstanding at quarter end, including exchangeable shares, and 71.6 million diluted shares

improved equity markets, equity assets increased to 36% of the total managed assets from 35% in June and 31% a year ago. Our institutional asset management division was responsible for 68% of our total assets under management as of September 30, while our mutual funds management division was responsible for 21% and our wealth management division, 11%.
Positive net client cash flows of approximately $13.9 billion were the primary contributor to the $20.3 billion increase in assets under management during the quarter, with market appreciation from equity and fixed income accounts accounting for the remainder of the increase. Each of our asset management divisions experienced strong positive net flows.
Ten of the 21 Legg Mason Funds, representing 81% of this funds family's total assets, performed in the top quartile of their respective Lipper categories for the 12 months ended September 30, 2003, and four of these funds were among the top five funds in their respective Lipper categories: Focus Trust was the #1 fund among all 649 large-cap growth equity funds and Maryland Tax-Free Income Trust was the #1 fund among all 34 Maryland municipal funds, while Opportunity Trust was the #3 fund and Special Investment Trust was the #5 fund among all 309 mid-cap core equity funds.
Total client assets, which include assets in our clients' securities brokerage accounts plus assets under management, minus any overlap, aggregated $299.6 billion as of September 30, 2003.
Segment Results for the Quarter
Our Asset Management and Private Client business segments were the primary contributors to our growth in earnings in the quarter ended September 30, 2003.
The net revenues of our Asset Management business segment totaled $221.3 million, up 46% from the year ago quarter, and this segment's pre-tax earnings increased by 74%, to $70.5 million. The increases in assets under management, and resulting increases in management fees, at Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Legg Mason Funds/Capital Management and Royce were the primary contributors to the segment's increases in net revenues and pre-tax earnings.
Our Private Client business segment's pre-tax earnings increased 76%, to $32.2 million, on a 14% net revenue increase, to $165.0 million. Expenses rose only 5% as increased sales compensation costs, due to increased revenues, were offset by lower non-compensation expenses.
The net revenues of our Capital Markets business segment were up 5%, to $72.7 million, but its pre-tax earnings dropped by 10%, to $12.7 million, as increased revenues and earnings in corporate finance were offset by lower taxable fixed income revenues and higher equity and fixed income overhead expenses.
The Other business segment consists principally of the single litigation award charge and losses on firm investments referenced above plus unallocated corporate expenses.
