Exhibit 99
 
Baltimore, Maryland - January 21, 2004-- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) reported today that its net earnings in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $80.8 million, up 69% from the year ago quarter, while net revenues were up 37%, to $506.4 million. Both set new records. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were a record $1.07, up 53%; the calculation of diluted earnings per share included an additional 4.4 million shares that would be issuable upon conversion of our zero-coupon contingent convertible senior notes, which reduced the quarter's diluted earnings per share by $0.05. In the year ago quarter, net revenues were $371.1 million, net earnings were $47.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.70.
Assets under management as of December 31, 2003 aggregated $264.9 billion, up 43% from $184.7 billion a year ago, and up 12% during the quarter, from $236.9 billion in September.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"This was by far the strongest quarter we have ever had. As a result, our earnings and earnings per share for the first nine months -- $205.8 million and $2.84 per diluted share -- have already exceeded last year's record earnings for the full year -- $190.9 million and $2.78 per diluted share.
"Asset Management was the key factor in our increased earnings, as its pre-tax profits were up 85% year-over-year and up 25% from the September quarter. Moreover, one of our goals has been to have our investment advisory and related fees exceed $1 billion per year; we are confident that this will happen this fiscal year, as these fees were $326 million in the quarter and $850 million in the first nine months."
Consolidated Results for the Quarter
For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, investment advisory and related fees were $326.5 million, up 51% from the year ago quarter, as all three divisions of this business -- institutional, mutual funds and wealth managers -- achieved substantial increases in revenues, reflecting their strong investment performance and net cash flows during the calendar year. The current quarter included $14.5 million of performance fees, up from $9.5 million a year ago. Overall, investment advisory and related fees represented 64% of the firm's total net revenues, up from 58% in the year ago quarter.

Commission revenues were $85.3 million, up 7% from $79.7 million a year ago, with listed commissions on retail trades and increased mutual fund commissions being primarily responsible. Commissions represented 17% of the firm's net revenues, down from 21% a year ago. Principal transactions were $39.9 million, essentially unchanged from $39.8 million a year ago, as substantial increases primarily in NASDAQ trading and institutional municipal fixed income were largely offset by decreases in retail and institutional fixed income transaction revenues. Investment banking revenues increased by 47%, to $34.3 million from $23.4 million, as increased revenues reflecting a more-than-fivefold increase in the average size of corporate underwritings managed or co-managed by the firm, as well as a substantial increase in advisory revenues, more than offset a decrease in municipal banking revenues.
Net interest profit was $6.4 million, up 32% from $4.8 million. Other revenues aggregated $14.1 million, up 91% from $7.4 million a year ago; the principal contributors to the increase were unrealized gains recorded on firm investments and annual servicing fees related to our retail brokerage business.
The pre-tax profit margin was 26.4% of net revenues, up from 20.3% a year ago, and the effective tax rate was 39.5%, versus 37.8%. The annualized return on equity was 22.4%, up from 16.1%.
As of December 31, 2003, stockholders' equity was $1.486 billion, up 23% from $1.209 billion a year ago, and book value per share was $21.76, up 21% from $18.02. The Company has 68.3 million shares outstanding, up from 67.1 million shares a year ago, including exchangeable shares, and 76.5 million diluted shares, up from 68.7 million shares a year ago, in part as a result of the inclusion of the 4.4 million shares issuable upon conversion of our zero-coupon contingent convertible senior notes.
Assets Under Management and Total Client Assets
Reflecting the continuing strength in the equity markets, and the strong investment performance of and net cash flows into our four largest managers in particular, assets under management as of December 31, 2003 increased by $80.2 billion, or 43%, to a record $264.9 billion, versus $184.7 billion a year ago, and were up $28.0 billion, or 12%, from $236.9 billion in September. Equity assets increased to 39% of total assets under management, up from 33% a year ago. Our institutional asset management division was responsible for 66% of our total assets under management, down from 70% a year ago, while our mutual funds management division increased its percentage of the total to 22% from 19%, and our wealth management division increased to 12% from 11%.
Positive net client cash flows of approximately $13.5 billion and market appreciation were roughly equal contributors to the $28.0 billion increase in assets under management during the quarter. The acquisition of the business of Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore), which closed on December 31st, accounted for $1.0 billion. Each of our managers with at least $10 billion in assets under management (Western Asset Management, Legg Mason Capital/Funds

Management, Private Capital Management, Royce, Brandywine and Batterymarch) had particularly strong net flows during the quarter, ranging from 4% to 16% of their beginning assets.
Currently, all but one of Western Asset's and all but one of Royce's rated funds, plus seven of the 18 rated Legg Mason Funds, had 4- or 5-star overall ratings from Morningstar. Fourteen of the 21 Legg Mason Funds, representing 95% of the fund family's total assets, outperformed their respective Lipper averages for calendar 2003. Among these, Legg Mason Value Trust achieved the extraordinary distinction of being the only fund known to have beaten the S&P 500 for 13 consecutive years, while Legg Mason Opportunity Trust was in the top 4% of all mid-cap core funds for both the 1-year (315 funds) and 3-year (243 funds) periods. Legg Mason Focus Trust was also recognized for its exceptional performance: it was the #1 fund among all large-cap growth funds for the 1-year (616 funds), 3-year (504 funds) and 5-year (320 funds) periods ended December 31.
Total client assets, which include assets in our clients' securities brokerage accounts plus assets under management, minus any overlap, aggregated $332.3 billion, up 37% from $241.8 billion a year ago.
Segment Results for the Quarter
Our Asset Management and Private Client business segments were the primary contributors to our growth in earnings during the quarter ended December 31, 2003.
The net revenues of our Asset Management business segment totaled $263.8 million, up 59% from the year ago quarter, and this segment's pre-tax earnings increased by 85%, to $88.1 million. The increases in assets under management, and resulting increases in management fees, at Private Capital Management, Royce, Western Asset and Legg Mason Capital/Funds Management were the primary contributors to the segment's increases in net revenues and pre-tax earnings. The segment's profit margin increased from 28.8% to 33.4%.
Our Private Client's business segment's pre-tax earnings doubled, to $32.8 million, on a 20% increase in net revenues, to $171.2 million; its profit margin increased from 11.6% to 19.2%.
Our Capital Markets business segment's net revenues rose 14% to $71.2 million and its pre-tax earnings rose 9% to $12.7 million. The segment's pre-tax profit margin declined slightly to 17.8% from 18.5%. Increased revenues and profits in corporate banking, institutional equity sales and trading and equity syndicate were largely offset by declines in revenues and profits in fixed income sales and trading and municipal banking.
The Other business segment consists primarily of firm investments plus unallocated corporate revenues and expenses.
