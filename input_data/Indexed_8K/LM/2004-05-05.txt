Baltimore, Maryland - May 5, 2004 -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported record net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for both its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. For the fiscal year, net earnings were $297.8 million, up 56% from last year's record results, based on net revenues of $1.941 billion, up 29% from last year, which was also the prior record. Diluted earnings per share were $4.06 for the fiscal year, 46% above last year's prior record of $2.78.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share also set new records: net revenues were up 49% over the prior year quarter, to $559.6 million; net earnings were up 89%, to $91.9 million; and diluted earnings per share were up 70%, to $1.21 from $0.71.
Assets under management ended the year at a record $286.4 billion, up 49% from year ago levels and up 8% in the last three months. Net client cash flows were responsible for just over half of the increase in managed assets in the last year and were responsible for approximately 70% of the increase during the quarter.
Commenting on the year end results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"During the last several years, we have focused on building the necessary infrastructure to create a sustainable balance in our business and to support future growth. Legg Mason and its shareholders clearly reaped the benefits of this strategy this year."
"All of our businesses had strong results. Our assets under management were up 49% this year, to $286 billion. Over $50 billion of this $94 billion increase was in equity assets, which helped drive a 77% increase in the pre-tax earnings of our Asset Management business. Private Client's pre-tax earnings were up 56% on a 15% increase in net revenues. Investment banking and institutional sales had record years, as our Capital Markets business increased its pre-tax profits by 7%.
"Our largest equity managers -- Legg Mason Funds/Capital Management, Private Capital Management, Royce, Brandywine and Batterymarch -- were each up over 70% in managed assets during the year. In fact, PCM's and Royce's assets each more than doubled during the year. At the same time, our premier fixed income manager -- Western Asset -- saw its assets under management increase by 34%, with its overseas assets nearly doubling. Our assets under management have increased, on average, by 26% a year for the past 5 years and 33% a year for the past 10 years."

Consolidated Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 2004 vs. March 2003

Due to the increase in our assets under management, investment advisory and related fees broke the one billion dollar mark this year: they were a record $1.2 billion, up 42% from last year, and represented 63% of the firm's total net revenues, up from 57%.

Commissions were up 8%, to $343.5 million, and represented 18% of the firm's net revenues, down from 21% in fiscal 2003. The increased commission levels were driven by increased retail investor activity. Principal transactions were up 5%, to $165.5 million.
Investment banking revenues were up 38% this year, to $150.1 million, primarily due to the strong increases in the fees generated by public underwritings.
