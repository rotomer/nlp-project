Baltimore, Maryland - October 21, 2004 -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported that the firm's revenues, earnings per share and assets under management in the September 2004 quarter were the highest in the firm's history; investment advisory and related fees also set a new firm record:
Net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were $568.0 million, up 24% from the September 2003 quarter. The previous record, set in the March 2004 quarter, was $559.6 million.
Net earnings were $91.7 million, up 38% from a year ago, and down slightly from the record of $91.9 million set in the March 2004 quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.81, up 31% from a year ago. The previous record was $0.80 per share, set in the March 2004 quarter.
Investment advisory and related fees were $393.9 million, up 40% from a year ago, and up 7% from $368.8 million in the June 2004 quarter, which was the previous record.
Assets under management aggregated $311.0 billion, up $74.1 billion, or 31%, from a year ago and up $15.3 billion, or 5%, from $295.7 billion in June, the previous record.
All share and earnings per share numbers have been restated for the 3-for-2 stock split effective September 24, 2004.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"Naturally we're delighted to be able to report these results in what has been a somewhat challenging market environment this past quarter.
"Our continued growth in assets under management -- up $74 billion in the last year and up $15 billion in the last three months -- has provided the key underpinning to these results. This asset growth translated into a 40% increase in our investment advisory and related fees in the last year and a 7% increase in the last quarter.
"The continuing momentum we have seen in our assets under management, both the aggregate amount of assets and the positive flows, has been our primary strength. As we have witnessed in the past, increasing our assets under management should bode well for our future revenues and profits."

Consolidated Results for the Quarter
Investment advisory and related fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 set a new record this quarter, up 40% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from June, the prior record. These results were primarily due to an increase in revenues at Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Legg Mason Capital Management and Royce, and to increased fee-based brokerage revenues in our Private Client Group. Investment advisory and related fees represented 69% of the firm's consolidated net revenues in the current quarter, up from 62% a year ago.

Revenues from retail and institutional securities brokerage, which includes commissions and principal transaction revenues, totaled $122.9 million, down 2% from a year ago. Commission revenues declined by 1%, as a decline in over-the-counter agency commissions more than offset increases in non-proprietary mutual fund and listed commissions. Commissions represented 15% of the firm's consolidated net revenues in the current quarter, down from 18% a year ago. Principal transaction revenues were down 3%, as increases in over-the-counter and European markets and institutional taxable fixed income transactions were more than offset by a decline in retail fixed income volume.
Investment banking revenues were down 21% from a year ago, as a result of substantial decreases in retail selling concessions and corporate advisory fees.
Net interest profit was $7.9 million, up 57% from a year ago, primarily due to higher average customer margin account balances and higher average interest rates earned on margin and firm investment balances, partially offset by an increase in the interest rates credited on lower customer credit balances. Other revenues were up 86%, primarily due to realized declines in the value of firm investments in the prior year quarter.
The pre-tax profit margin on net revenues was 26.2% in the current quarter, up from 21.1% a year ago, and the effective tax rate decreased slightly, to 38.3% from 38.6%. The annualized return on equity increased to 21.7% from 17.5%.

As of September 30, 2004, stockholders' equity was $1.728 billion, up 24% from a year ago, and book value per share was up 22%, to $16.69. The Company had 103.5 million shares outstanding at quarter end, including exchangeable shares, and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter was 114.7 million.
Assets Under Management and Total Client Assets
Assets under management as of September 30, 2004 aggregated $311.0 billion, up $74.1 billion, or 31%, from $236.9 billion a year ago, and up $15.3 billion, or 5%, from $295.7 billion in June. Net flows contributed 83% of the increase during the quarter, with all of our asset management

divisions -- Institutional, Wealth Management and Mutual Funds -- experiencing positive net flows.
Our Institutional asset management division is currently responsible for 66% of our total assets under management, with our Mutual Funds management division responsible for 22% and our Wealth Management division, 12%. Equity assets account for 38% of our total assets under management.
Total client assets, which include assets in our clients' securities brokerage accounts plus assets under management, minus any overlap, aggregated $381.1 billion at September 30, 2004, up from $299.6 billion a year ago.
Segment Results for the Quarter
Asset Management continued to drive our consolidated results: in the current quarter, this business segment accounted for 57% of the firm's net revenues and 71% of pre-tax earnings.
The 46% increase in Asset Management revenues over the year ago quarter, and the 50% increase in pre-tax earnings, were primarily due to increases in the assets under management and resulting increases in the investment advisory fees at our four largest money managers: Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Legg Mason Capital Management and Royce.
Private Client's net revenues were up 5% from a year ago, as increased investment advisory and related fees more than offset decreases in retail selling concessions, retail commissions and principal transaction revenues. Private Client's pre-tax earnings decreased by 7%, however, primarily due to an increase in overhead costs. Private Client accounted for 31% of the firm's net revenues and 20% of pre-tax earnings in the current quarter.
Although institutional equity sales were up from year ago levels, the net revenues and pre-tax earnings of our Capital Markets business segment were down 1% and 2%, respectively, from the year ago quarter, primarily due to sharp declines in new public offerings and other corporate financing activity. Capital Markets accounted for 13% of the firm's net revenues and 8% of pre-tax earnings in the current quarter.
Fiscal Year to Date Results
For the six months ended September 30, 2004, net revenues were up 26% from the comparable period a year ago. Investment advisory and related fees were up 46%, and represented 69% of the firm's consolidated net revenues. Commissions were up slightly, and represented 15% of consolidated net revenues, while principal transactions were down 2%. Investment banking was down 18%. Net interest profit was up 33% and other revenues were up 20%.
Net earnings for the six months ended September 30, 2004 were up 42% and diluted earnings per share were up 33%. Legg Mason's pre-tax profit margin was 26.0%, up from 21.9%, and the effective tax rate was 38.0%, down from 38.6% in the year ago period.
