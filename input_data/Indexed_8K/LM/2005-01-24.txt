Exhibit 99
Baltimore, Maryland - January 24, 2005 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported that the firm's revenues, earnings and earnings per share
1
in the December 2004 quarter were the highest in the firm's history. Record net flows in its assets under management helped establish new records in assets under management and investment advisory and related fees:
Net revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $636.8 million, up 26% from the December 2003 quarter and up 12% from the September 2004 quarter, the previous record.
Net earnings were $112.7 million, up 39% from a year ago. The previous record was $91.9 million, set in the March 2004 quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.98, up 38% from a year ago and up 21% from $0.81 in the September 2004 quarter, the previous record.
Assets under management now stand at $360.5 billion, up $95.6 billion from year ago levels and up $49.5 billion since September, which was the previous record. The increase in the last three months was the result of $21.6 billion in net flows and $22.5 billion in market appreciation, as well as $5.4 billion from the acquisition of four offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel, which we completed on December 31.
Investment advisory and related fees were $433.1 million, up 33% from a year ago and up 10% from $393.9 million in the September 2004 quarter, the previous record.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"The most significant aspect of our very strong results this quarter were the record net flows into our assets under management: during the quarter, almost $22 billion in net new money came into our asset management business - 45% more than we experienced in any prior quarter. This organic growth, which was more than matched in dollar terms by market appreciation, resulted in each of our Asset Management divisions - Mutual Funds, Institutional and Wealth Management - achieving internal growth in their assets under management of 13-15% during the quarter.
"Including our investment counsel acquisition, we increased our assets under management by almost $50 billion during the quarter, or 16%. In the past 12 months, we have increased our assets under management by almost $96 billion, or 36%, to $360 billion.

"Long term performance remains a very important, if not the most important, factor in current and future growth. As many of you know, our Value Trust mutual fund has now outperformed the S&P 500 for 14 straight years. It is also a pleasure to point out that Western Asset was named by Morningstar as 'Fixed-Income Manager of the Year' for 2004. Private Capital Management was named by Nelson's as the #1 US Value Equity manager for the 10-year period ended September 30, 2004.

"Our other business segments also posted solid results during the quarter. Our Private Client Group, which had a very strong quarter, saw its pre-tax profit margin rise to 20.5%. The institutional equity and investment banking components of our Capital Markets business also experienced solid increases from the September quarter."
Consolidated Results for the Quarter
Investment advisory and related fees for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were a record $433.1 million, up 33% from the year ago quarter and up 10% from $393.9 million in the September 2004 quarter, the prior record. These results were primarily due to an increase in revenues at Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Royce and Legg Mason Capital Management

, and to increased fee-based revenues in our Private Client Group. Investment advisory and related fees represented 68% of the firm's consolidated net revenues in the current quarter, up from 64% a year ago.
Revenues from retail and institutional securities brokerage, which includes commissions and principal transaction revenues, were $132.1 million, an increase of 6% from year ago levels. Commission revenues increased by 9%, primarily due to increases in listed commissions and the fact that the year ago quarter included a $4.0 million provision for reimbursements of mutual fund commissions. Commissions represented 15% of the firm's consolidated net revenues in the current quarter, versus 17% a year ago. Principal transaction revenues were down 2% as a result of a decline in fixed income transaction volume.
Investment banking revenues were up 14% from a year ago, primarily as a result of a substantial increase in private placement revenues.
Net interest profit was $10.7 million, up 68% from a year ago, primarily due to higher interest rates earned on segregated customer and margin account balances and firm investments, partially offset by higher rates paid on customer credit account balances. The firm's net interest profit margin increased to 33% from 30%. Other revenues were up 55%, primarily due to increased values of firm investments as well as increased revenues from various Private Client customer account service fees.

Segment Results for the Quarter
Our Asset Management business segment continues to drive our consolidated results: in the current quarter, it accounted for 57% of the firm's net revenues and 68% of pre-tax earnings.
The 37% increase in Asset Management revenues over those revenues in the year ago quarter, and the 41% increase in pre-tax earnings, were primarily due to increases in the assets under management and resulting increases in the investment advisory fees at our four largest moneymanagers: Private Capital Management, Western Asset, Royce and Legg Mason Capital Management.
Private Client accounted for 30% of the firm's net revenues and 22% of pre-tax earnings in the current quarter. Private Client's net revenues were up 13% from a year ago, primarily as a result of a 21%, or $12.6 million, increase in investment advisory and related fees.
Capital Markets accounted for 13% of the firm's net revenues and 8% of pre-tax earnings in the current quarter. The net revenues and pre-tax earnings of this business segment were up 13% and 20%, respectively, from the year ago quarter, as increased revenues and earnings in corporate and

structured finance and institutional equity sales were partially offset by decreased revenues and earnings in fixed income sales and trading.
