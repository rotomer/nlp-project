Exhibit 99
Baltimore, Maryland - May 4, 2005 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported that the firm's revenues and earnings in both the quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were the highest in the firm's history. Assets under management as well as investment advisory and related fees also set new firm records. Diluted earnings per share were a record for the fiscal year and, despite a 5% increase in shares, were equal to the record December 2004 quarter.
For the year, net earnings were up 37% from a year ago, to $408.4 million, on a 24% increase in net revenues, to $2.4 billion.
Diluted earnings per share were a record for the year, increasing by 33% to $3.53.
Assets under management increased during the year by $86.5 billion, or 30%, to a record $372.9 billion. Net client cash flows of $64.4 billion were responsible for just under 75% of the increase.
For the quarter, net earnings were up 28% from the comparable quarter a year ago, to $117.6 million, on a 19% increase in net revenues, to $665.0 million.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.98, up 23% from the year ago quarter and unchanged from the record December 2004 quarter despite a 5% increase in diluted average shares outstanding, primarily resulting from our common stock offering in December 2004.
During the quarter, assets under management increased by $12.4 billion, or 3%, despite negative returns in both the US equity and fixed income markets. Net client cash flows in the quarter aggregated $20.0 billion, just below the record of $21.6 billion set in the December 2004 quarter.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"The strong long-term performance record of our largest asset managers is the primary reason for our continuing ability to attract new client assets. Our asset-gathering performance overall in the last year was, I believe, excellent by almost any measurement. Assets under management increased by almost $87 billion, or 30%, during the year, with $64 billion of this total growth coming from positive client cash flows. Our four largest managers experienced both positive market performance and double-digit-percentage positive net flows.
"In the March quarter, given the negative returns in both the equity and fixed income markets, our results were particularly impressive. Assets under management were up $12 billion during the quarter, at the same time as many others in our industry seem to have experienced very little if any growth."

Consolidated Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 2005 vs. March 2004
For the fiscal year, net revenues were $2.4 billion, up 24% from fiscal 2004. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $408.4 million, up 37%, and $3.53, up 33%, respectively.
Due to the increase in our assets under management, investment advisory and related fees were a record $1.7 billion, up 36% from last year, and represented 69% of the firm's total net revenues, up from 63%. Each of our three asset management divisions - Institutional, Mutual Funds and Wealth Management - experienced solid growth in assets under management and net revenues.
Securities brokerage revenues, which consist of commissions and principal transaction revenues, were up 2%, to $519.9 million, primarily as a result of increases in distribution fees from non-proprietary mutual funds, partially offset by a decrease in institutional fixed income trading volume. Commissions were up 4%, to $358.3 million, and represented 15% of the firm's net revenues, down from 18% in fiscal 2004. Principal transaction revenues were down 2%, to $161.5 million.
Investment banking revenues were down 9% this year, to $137.3 million, primarily as a result of a 44% decrease in retail selling concessions, partially offset by substantial increases in municipal banking and corporate advisory fees.
Net interest profit rose 79%, to $37.9 million, primarily as a result of substantially higher interest rates earned on customer margin account balances and firm investments.
Legg Mason's pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 27.3%, up from 24.3% in fiscal 2004. The firm's effective tax rate was 38.0% versus 38.5%, while the return on equity was 21.7%, up from 21.2%.
As of March 31, 2005, stockholders' equity was $2.293 billion, up 47% from $1.560 billion a year ago, and book value per share was up 38%, to $20.97 from $15.18. Legg Mason had 109.4 million shares outstanding as of March 31, 2005 and 117.1 million weighted average diluted shares for the year ended March 31, 2005. In December 2004, we sold 4.6 million shares in an underwritten offering of our common stock, with net proceeds of approximately $311 million.
Consolidated Results for the Quarter Ended March 2005 vs. March 2004
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, Legg Mason's net earnings were up 28% on a 19% increase in net revenues: net earnings were $117.6 million, while net revenues were $665.0 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 23%, to $0.98 from $0.80.
Investment advisory and related fees were $460.5 million, up 26%, primarily as a result of increases in assets under management. Investment advisory and related fees represented 69% of the firm's total net revenues versus 66% a year ago.
Revenues from securities brokerage, which includes commissions and principal transaction revenues, totaled $136.5 million, up 4%. The increase was primarily the result of increased distribution fees from non-proprietary mutual funds. Commissions were $96.7 million, up 7%, and represented 15% of the firm's total net revenues. Principal transaction revenues were $39.8 million, down 3%.
Investment banking revenues were down 10%, to $40.6 million, as decreases in corporate underwriting and private placement fees were only partially offset by increases in corporate advisory and municipal banking revenues.
Net interest profit more than tripled, to $13.4 million, primarily as a result of substantially higher interest rates earned on customer margin account balances and firm investments.

The pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 28.6%, up from 26.2% a year ago, and the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 38.1%, up from 37.3%. The annualized return on equity was 21.1%, down from 24.2%, primarily as a result of our selling 4.6 million shares of our common stock in the public markets, for net proceeds of approximately $311 million, in December 2004.
Assets Under Management and Total Client Assets
Assets under management as of March 31, 2005 aggregated $372.9 billion, an increase of $86.5 billion, or 30%, from $286.4 billion a year ago. Net client cash flows were responsible for just under 75% of the increase, with market performance - including currency translation - accounting for 20% and the December 31, 2004 acquisition of four offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel accounting for most of the remainder.
Our equity assets declined as a percentage of our total managed assets from 39% a year ago to 38% today. Our Institutional asset management division was responsible for 66% of our total managed assets at year end, with our Mutual Funds division responsible for 21% and Wealth Management, 13%.
In the last three months, assets under management increased by $12.4 billion, or 3%, from December 2004's $360.5 billion. Net client cash flows aggregated $20.0 billion during the quarter, with Western Asset the primary contributor. All of our asset management divisions - Institutional, Mutual Funds and Wealth Management - experienced positive net flows despite market depreciation during the quarter.
Total client assets, which include assets in our clients' securities brokerage accounts plus assets under management, minus any overlap, aggregated $449.2 billion as of March 31, 2005.
