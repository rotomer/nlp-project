The Company will acquire an 80% interest in Permal at the initial closing, and the remaining outstanding equity interests in Permal will be converted into preference shares. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has a call right to acquire the outstanding preference shares in two tranches, following the second and fourth years after the initial closing. If the Company does not exercise either of its call rights, the shareholders have a put right to require the Company to purchase the shares in the same general time frames. The total payment at the initial closing is expected to be $800 million, subject to potential adjustment, of which up to 25% may, at the Company's option, be in the form of shares of the Company's common stock, and the remainder of which will be in cash. The purchase price for the residual 20% interest in Permal under the put and call rights will be formula-based depending upon Permal's net revenues at the time of purchase, and at the time of payment of an earn-out two years after each purchase date, and subject to certain minimums and caps. The aggregate price for 100% of Permal is capped at $1.386 billion, with a $961 million minimum payment. The Company may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of the Company's common stock.
 
The closing of the transaction, which is currently expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this calendar year, is subject to (i) receipt of certain domestic and international regulatory approvals, (ii) the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the sellers and Permal completing a restructuring of Permal's corporate and ownership structure, (iv) Permal's revenues at closing from investment advisory services to clients constituting at least 80% of its corresponding March 31, 2005 investment advisory revenues (calculated in a manner as set forth in the Purchase Agreement) and (v) certain key employees of Permal remaining employed under their employment contracts at the closing date, as well as other customary conditions to closing. The Company and Permal have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including, among others, covenants to conduct Permal's business in the ordinary course between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the transaction.

Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement described above in Item 1.01(a) of this current report, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, the Company agreed to pay a portion of the consideration in the transaction in the form of a five year unsecured loan facility provided by Citigroup's Corporate and Investment Bank.

This issuance of these securities will be made pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement described above in Item 1.01(b) of this current report, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, the Company has the right to pay up to 25% of each of the payments for the acquisition of Permal in the form of newly issued shares of common stock of the Company. If the Company elects to make any such payments in the form of common stock, the number of shares that it will issue will be determined by dividing the amount of the payment by the average closing price per share of Company common stock during the 20 trading day period ended three days before the payment date. If any shares of common stock are issued, the issuance will be made pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax Benefit or Tax cost incurred, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to pay Tax at the highest United States federal income tax corporate marginal rate in effect in the year such indemnifiable Loss is incurred and the recipient of the Tax Benefit shall be deemed to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the first taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under Requirements of Law after taking into account all other Tax Attributes of such indemnified party and the projected utilization of such Tax Attributes as computed by the recipient of such Tax Benefit. If a Tax Benefit resulting from the incurrence or payment of Losses is available to any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in multiple Tax years, the amount of such Tax Benefit for purposes of this Section 10.6(b) shall be the net present value of all of such available Tax Benefits, calculated by using a discount rate equal to the long-term applicable federal rate for the month in which such Losses are incurred. The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final
 
determination (which shall include the execution of Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes, and any payments, if necessary, by the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party to reflect such adjustment shall be made if necessary within 10 days of such determination.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of any demand or claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "") that could reasonably be expected to result in a Loss, the Indemnified Party shall give notice thereof (a "") to any other party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 (each, an ""). Each Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party.

Claims Notice
Indemnifying Party
 
(b) The Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any Asserted Liability unless the claim solely involves (and continues to involve) equitable relief; , , that if the parties in any action shall include both an Indemnifying Party and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are available different or additional defenses to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate counsel (consisting of, with respect to any Asserted Liability or related Asserted Claims, one law firm and one local counsel) and to participate in the defense of such action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Subject to the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Asserted Liability so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability or fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided, the Indemnified Party may defend such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is permitted hereunder) to compromise or defend any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the compromise or defense of such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to receipt of a reasonable confidentiality agreement, make available to the Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents within its control, and the reasonable assistance of its employees, for which the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of making them available. No Indemnified Party may settle any claim for an Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.4. . In the event that any party incurs or suffers any Losses with respect to which indemnification may be sought by such party pursuant to this Article VIII (other than in respect of third party claims), the Indemnified Party must assert the claim by a Claims Notice to the Indemnifying Party. The Claims Notice must state the nature
Procedure for Claims by Parties
 
and basis of the claim in reasonable detail based on the information available to the Indemnified Party and whether the party intends to set-off any amounts from future payments. Each Indemnifying Party to whom a Claims Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified Party that has given a Claims Notice (a "") within sixty (60) days (the "") after the date that the Claims Notice is given. Any Claim Response shall specify whether or not the Indemnifying Party given the Claim Response disputes the claim described in the Claims Notice. If any Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response within the Response Period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to dispute the claim described in the related Claims Notice. If any Indemnifying Party elects not to dispute a claim described in a Claims Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to such Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the last day of the applicable Response Period the amount to which such Indemnified Party shall be entitled. If any Indemnifying Party fails to pay all or any part of any indemnification obligation on or before thirty (30) days after the later to occur of (a) the last day of the applicable Response Period and (b) if the Claims Notice relates to Losses that have not been liquidated as of the date of the Claims Notice, the date on which all or any part of such Losses shall have become liquidated and determined, then the Indemnifying Party shall also be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party interest on the unpaid amount for each day during which the obligation remains unpaid at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest charged by Citibank, N.A. as its prime or base rate for commercial loans, calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days and the actual number of days elapsed from the applicable Indemnification Payment Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer may set-off any amount to which it may be entitled under this Article VIII against any amounts otherwise payable by Buyer to such Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Prior to proceeding directly against any Management Shareholder, Buyer shall, to the extent possible, set-off any amount to which it is entitled under this Article VIII against any amounts otherwise payable by Buyer to such Management Shareholder pursuant to Article II of this Agreement (including all Post-Initial Closing Payments). In the event of a dispute with respect to any amount that may be owed by a Seller Indemnitor to Buyer hereunder at the time of any payment to be made under Article II, in lieu of setting off the amount in dispute, Buyer shall deposit such amount into an escrow account on terms mutually satisfactory to Buyer, Parent and the Management Representative.
Claim Response
Response Period
 
Section 8.5. . The indemnification provided for in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and, to the extent provided below, in Section 6.11, shall be subject to the following limitations:
Limitations on Indemnification
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided below, an Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay any indemnification amounts (i) for Losses pursuant to this Article VIII in respect of Sections 8.1(a)(i), 8.1(a)(iii) or 8.2(a) to any Indemnified Party or (ii) for Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 6.11 unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses and Indemnified Taxes for which such Indemnified Party, Company or Buyer, as the case may be, is entitled to indemnification pursuant thereto exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to fourteen million dollars ($14,000,000), in which case the Indemnified Party, Company or Buyer, as the case may be, shall be entitled to recover only the amount by which such Losses and Indemnified Taxes taken together exceed such amount. Except as otherwise provided in the
 
previous sentence, the Seller Indemnitors shall not be obligated to pay any indemnification amounts for Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 6.11 to any Company or Buyer unless and until the aggregate amount of all Indemnified Taxes for which such Company or Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant thereto exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to seven million dollars ($7,000,000), in which case such Company or Buyer shall be entitled to recover only the amount by which such Indemnified Taxes exceed such amount.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided below, in no event shall the aggregate liability under this Agreement (including Section 6.11 hereof) of either (i) the Sellers, on the one hand, or (ii) Buyer, on the other hand, exceed the greater of (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Aggregate Consideration and (ii) five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) (the ""). Except as otherwise provided below, in no event shall the aggregate liability of any Seller exceed such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Cap; , , that any such amounts paid by any Sellers that are not Seller Indemnitors shall be deducted from the maximum amount payable by each Seller Indemnitor pursuant to the Cap in accordance with the respective Seller Indemnitor Pro Rata Shares.
Cap
provided
however
 
(c) No claims for indemnification in respect of Sections 8.1(a)(i), 8.1(a)(iii), 8.1(b)(i) or 8.2(a) shall be made after the date, if any, on which the applicable representation, warranty or indemnity upon which such claim was based ceases to survive pursuant to Section 8.6; , , that such time limitations shall not apply to any such claims which have been the subject of a written notice from Buyer to the Seller Indemnitors or from Parent or the Management Representative to Buyer, as the case may be, prior to such period, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the nature and basis for such claim.
provided
however
 
(d) Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred arising out of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller Indemnitor, the Companies or Buyer (and not for purposes of determining whether or not a breach has occurred), the references "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms) shall be disregarded.
 
(e) No right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Initial Closing or the knowledge of any party of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the other party at any time, or the decision of any party to complete the Initial Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall have the right, irrespective of any knowledge or investigation of such party, to rely fully, and is relying fully, on the representations, warranties and covenants of the other parties contained herein.
 
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no limitation or condition of liability or indemnity in Section 8.5(a) shall apply to any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.15, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.5.
 
(g) Any Losses required to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced by (i) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Tax or Loss indemnified thereunder and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any amounts in respect of indemnification or reimbursement arrangements received by the Indemnified Party or any of its
 
Affiliates with respect to the item giving rise to the indemnification payment. The Indemnified Party shall diligently pursue recovery under insurance policies and other rights to indemnification or reimbursement from third parties with respect to indemnifiable Losses hereunder. For purposes of the foregoing, any net Tax benefit shall be reduced by any net Tax detriment resulting from the receipt or accrual of the indemnification payment and shall be determined after taking into account all other deductions and losses, including any net operating loss carryforwards, as if such Tax benefit did not exist; that creating or increasing a net operating loss carryforward shall be deemed to create a Tax benefit only when such net operating loss carryforward is used. If a payment is made by any Seller in accordance with this Article VIII, and if in a subsequent taxable year a Tax benefit contemplated in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(g) is realized by Buyer or any of the Companies with respect to such payment (that was not previously taken into account to reduce an amount otherwise payable by the Sellers), Buyer shall promptly pay to the Sellers pursuant to their Pro Rata Share, within five (5) Business Days of the earlier of receipt or entitlement thereto, the amount of such Tax benefit. With respect to any such Tax benefit that may be realized in a subsequent year, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a liquidated amount in respect of such benefit and to adjust the payment by an Indemnifying Party at that time instead of when actually realized as provided above, but if the parties are unable to agree on such liquidated amount, then the Indemnified Party will later pay to the Indemnifying Party the Tax benefit when it is actually realized as provided above.
provided
 
(h) Each Seller shall have no, and hereby waives any, claims or subrogation rights against Permal in connection with any liability that such Seller may incur as a result of this Agreement, including this Article VIII.
 
Section 8.6. . Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Initial Closing Date and shall remain in full force and effect. The representations and warranties set forth in Articles III, IV and V, or any certificate delivered hereunder, and the obligation of the Sellers to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii), shall survive the Initial Closing Date for a period of eighteen (18) months, except (a) the representations in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.15, 5.1, 5.2, 5.5 and 5.10 shall survive until thirty (30) days after the date on which the statute of limitations applicable to such matters expires and (b) the foregoing time limitations shall not apply to any claims which have been the subject of a written notice prior to expiration of the applicable time period.
Post-Closing Survival
 
Section 8.7. . Amounts paid in respect of indemnification obligations of the parties shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any claim involving a third party, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.
 
Section 8.9. . NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO PERSON SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), SPECIAL DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR FOR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOST PROPERTY EXCEPT, IN EACH CASE, FOR AMOUNTS PAID TO THIRD PARTIES IN RESPECT OF INDEMNIFIABLE CLAIMS.
Consequential Damages
 
Section 8.10. . Other than with respect to the limitations under Sections 8.5(a) and 8.5(b), anything in this Article VIII to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed solely by Section 6.11 and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Article VIII

Termination Without Cause
 
(a) The Company may terminate the Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time without Cause, subject to the severance provisions set forth in Section 4.4(b) below.

Employee shall further be entitled to receive reimbursement for expenses (in accordance with Company policies) incurred prior to the effective date of such termination.

The Employee shall promptly notify the Company if the Employee elects to obtain such benefits as described in Section 3.1(c) above from other employment, consulting or otherwise.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the preceding, if the amounts payable to the Employee pursuant to this Section 4.4, either alone or together with other payments which the Employee has the right to receive either directly or indirectly from the Company, would constitute an excess parachute payment (the "Excess Payment") under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Employee hereby agrees that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount necessary to prevent any such payments to the Employee from constituting an Excess Payment, as determined by the Company's independent auditors.
 
4.5 .
Termination at Employee's Option for Good Reason

The Employee shall thereupon be entitled to terminate his employment with the Company for Good Reason and, upon doing so, the Employee shall be treated as if he or she were terminated without Cause under the provisions of Section 4.4.
 
5. . As an inducement to Legg Mason and the Company to enter into the Acquisition Agreement and in consideration of the benefits to be derived by the Employee under this Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement, and to preserve the goodwill associated with the business of the Company, the Employee hereby agrees to the following restrictions on the Employee's business activities that are not on behalf of the Company under this Agreement:
Restricted Activities
 
5.1 (a) As a separate and independent covenant, the Employee agrees that, during the Restricted Period (as defined below), the Employee shall not, without the written consent of the Company (which may be withheld for any or no reason in the Company's sole discretion)
 
directly or indirectly, whether for his own account or for the account of any other person, firm, corporation, or other business organization, (i) provide Investment Advisory Services (as defined below) to any Client (as defined below) or be employed by or affiliated or associated with any enterprise which directly or indirectly provides or offers to provide such services to any Client, (ii) make any statements or take any actions that may interfere with the Company's or an Affiliate's business relationships with any Client; (iii) contact either directly or indirectly any Client or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any Client to enter into any business relationship or to place any funds or securities under management with any person or firm other than the Company or an Affiliate relating to investments of any type, (iv) endeavor to entice away from the Company any person who is, or was at any time during the Restricted Period, employed by the Company, or during the Restricted Period, employed by or associated with the Company as an executive, officer, employee, manager, salesperson, consultant, independent contractor, representative or other agent; or (v) take any actions that may interfere with the Company's property rights in lists of Clients or otherwise diminish the value of such lists to the Company.
 
(b) The term "Restricted Period" shall mean the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the later of: (a) five (5) years after the Effective Date or (b) one year after termination of the Employee's employment.
 
(c) The term "Investment Advisory Services" shall mean investment consulting, the rendering of investment advice to institutional or individual clients, the management of publicly traded securities for institutional or individual accounts, asset management and all other services which are customarily provided by persons or entities registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
 
(d) For all purposes of this Agreement, the term "Client" shall have the meaning set forth in the Acquisition Agreement and those clients who are named on a list given to Employee within ten (10) business days after his termination of employment. The term "Client" shall not include any member of the Employee's immediate family, as defined under Rule 16a-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or any trust of which the Employee or any member of his immediate family is a grantor or beneficiary (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act).
 
5.2 As a separate and independent covenant, the Employee agrees that, during the Restricted Period, the Employee shall not, either for the Employee's own account or on behalf of any person or entity with which the Employee is associated or affiliated, without prior written approval from the Board, directly or indirectly, own, share in the earnings of, or invest in the stock, bonds, or other securities of any person, firm or business organization which shall do or attempt to do any of the activities described in Section 5.1, except in accordance with the Employee Investment Criteria set forth below. For purposes hereof, the Employee Investment Criteria shall mean an investment in stocks, bonds or other securities which meets all of the following criteria: (a) such stock, bonds or other securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or are securities of open end investment companies; (b) such investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, one percent (1%) of the issued and outstanding
 
shares, or, in the case of bonds or other securities, one percent (1%) of the aggregate principal amount thereof issued and outstanding; and (c) such investment is in compliance with the Company's and Legg Mason's code of ethics.
 
5.3 As a separate and independent covenant, the Employee covenants and agrees that beginning on the Effective Date and ending one year after termination of the Employee's employment, the Employee shall not directly or indirectly, whether for his own account or for the account of any other person, firm, corporation, or other business organization, engage in the business of providing or soliciting to provide Investment Advisory Services of any type to any person or entity. In addition, the Employee covenants and agrees that, from the Effective Date until one year after termination of the Employee's employment, the Employee shall not, either for the Employee's own account or on behalf of any person or entity with which the Employee is associated or affiliated, without the prior written approval of the Board, directly or indirectly be employed by, provide consulting or other services or assistance to, own, or invest in the stock, bonds, or other securities of any person, firm or business organization which shall do or attempt to do any of the activities described above in this Section 5.3, except in accordance with the Employee Investment Criteria set forth in Section 5.2. To the extent that the provisions contained in this Section 5.3 are more restrictive than the covenants contained in Section 5.1 or 5.2, the parties intend that this Section 5.3 shall control and shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
5.4 The Employee agrees that, if Employee should breach any of the covenants of Section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 above, the Restricted Period and the period specified in Section 5.3 above for all such sections shall be extended by the length of time during which the Employee is in breach of any such covenants.
 
5.5 The Employee and the Company agree that the periods of time and the scope applicable to the covenants of Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company without unduly limiting the Employee's ability to obtain employment or otherwise earn a living at the same general level of economic benefit as anticipated by this Agreement. However, if such period or scope should be adjudged unreasonable in any judicial or other dispute resolution proceeding, then the period of time or scope shall be reduced by the extent deemed unreasonable, so that these covenants may be enforced during such period and for such scope as are adjudged to be reasonable.
 
5.6 It is understood by and between the parties hereto that the covenants by the Employee set forth in this Section 5 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Employee to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement and Legg Mason and the Company would not have entered into the Acquisition Agreement. The Company and the Employee have independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature of the businesses conducted by the Company and its Affiliates.
 
5.7 For purposes of applying Section 5.1(a), Employee acknowledges that (i) any goodwill associated with relationships with Clients belongs solely to the Company and not to the Employee, (ii) the transaction with the Company pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement has recognized substantial value for such good will and through the subsequent payment thereunder may recognize substantial additional value, and (iii) Employee, as a shareholder of Permal, is sharing in the value vested thereby.
 
6. . The Employee agrees that the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, either during the period of the Employee's employment with the Company or any time thereafter, divulge or use any information regarding the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, confidential records, Client and customer lists, computer software, data, documents, operational methods, pricing and investment policies and trade know-how and secrets) compiled by, created by, obtained by, or furnished to, the Employee while the Employee is employed by or associated with the Company; provided, however, that this obligation to maintain confidentiality shall not apply to any such information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Employee in violation of this Agreement, or (b) subsequent to termination of employment is disclosed to the Employee on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company and not known by the Employee to be subject to a confidentiality agreement between such source and the Company. All materials, records and documents (whether in written or other tangible form, including electronic media) made by the Employee or coming into the Employee's possession concerning the business or affairs of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be the sole property of the Company and its Affiliates. Upon the termination of the Employee's employment hereunder for any reason or upon the request of the Company during the Employment Period, the Employee shall promptly deliver such materials, records and documents, and all copies thereof, to the Company or to any of its Affiliates designated by the Company. The Employee's covenants contained in this Section 6 shall survive any termination of the Employee's employment with the Company hereunder for any reason, and shall be enforceable as provided in Section 8 following such termination.
Confidentiality
 
7. . The Employee agrees to render to the Company or to any Affiliate designated by it such reports of the activities undertaken by the Employee or conducted under the Employee's direction pursuant hereto during the Employment Period as the Company may reasonably request. The Employee also agrees to provide, and the Company may similarly provide, a copy of Sections 5, 6 and 8 of this Agreement to any business or enterprise engaged in providing Investment Advisory Services (i) which the Employee may directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, finance, join, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing, control or control of, or (ii) with which the Employee may be connected as an officer, director, employee, partner, principal, agent, representative, consultant or otherwise, or in connection with which the Employee may use the Employee's name or permit the Employee's name to be used; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply in respect of Section 5 of this Agreement after expiration of the time period set forth therein.
Covenants to Report
 
8. . (a) The Employee's covenants contained in Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive any termination of the Employee's employment with the Company hereunder for
Specific Performance
 
any reason, and shall be enforceable following such termination. Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company, the Employee agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to the Company in the event that the Employee violates any of the terms of Section 5, 6 or 7 and that the Company may apply for and is entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to specifically enforce, any of the covenants of such Sections, in each case without proof of actual damages. Moreover, in the event that the Employee violates any of the terms of Section 5 or 6, any obligations to make severance payments, including all payments and benefits to which the Employee would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement, shall cease to the full extent permitted by law. In the event that any covenant contained in Section 5 or 6 is deemed to be unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Employee agrees and submits to that covenant as modified in such manner as that court shall deem reasonable.
 
9. . The Employee represents and warrants to the Company that the execution of this Agreement by the Employee and the Employee's performance of the Employee's obligations hereunder will not, with or without the giving of notice and/or the passage of time, conflict with, result in the breach of any provision of or the termination of, or constitute a default under, any agreement to which the Employee is a party or by which the Employee is or may be bound.
Compliance With Other Agreements
 
10. . Neither party shall have the right to assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Any merger or consolidation of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent thereof other than Legg Mason) or any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent thereof other than Legg Mason) shall be deemed an assignment in violation of the terms of this Section 10, unless Legg Mason shall be the direct or indirect parent of the successor entity, in which case the Employee's consent shall not be required. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
Assignment
 
11. . The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any partially unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
Severability
 
12. . Neither this Agreement nor any term or condition hereof or right hereunder may be waived or shall be deemed to have been waived or modified in whole or in part by any party or by the forbearance of any party to exercise any of its rights hereunder, except by written instrument executed by or on behalf of that party. The waiver by either party of a breach by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the other party.
Waivers
 
13. . All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective (a) when delivered personally, (b) when sent by confirmed facsimile, (c) one (1) day after deposit with a

WHEREAS, concurrently with such acquisition by Legg Mason, the share capital of Permal is being reorganized so that Legg Mason will own all of the Common Shares, and the remaining shareholders of Permal, in lieu of their non-voting ordinary shares of  1 each of Permal, will own only Preference Shares of  1 each of Permal (the "Preferred Shares"), the terms of which are set forth in the articles of association, as amended (the "Articles") of Permal substantially in the form attached as Schedule 3.1(c) to the Acquisition Agreement; and
 
WHEREAS, as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, the Preferred Shares are subject to call options granted to Legg Mason and put options granted by it; and
 
WHEREAS, the parties desire to afford the management of the Companies discretion with respect to the day-to-day operations of the Companies in light of existing management's demonstrated ability to manage Permal and the desire of the parties to allow management to participate in the growth of the Companies; and
 
WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into certain agreements regarding revenues, expenses and management of the Companies deemed necessary by the parties to foster the continued growth and expansion of the Companies' business; and
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows;
 
1. .
Consolidated Net Revenues
 
(a) . Consolidated Net Revenues ("CNR") shall mean, for any given financial period, the difference between (i) the sum of Consolidated
Definition of Consolidated Net Revenues
 
Gross Revenues ("CGR") and (ii) Consolidated Variable Costs ("CVC"), each for such period, of the consolidation scope ("CS") of Permal. The first such period shall begin on the day of the Initial Closing and end on the last day of the month in which the Initial Closing occurs. This Agreement relates solely to net operating revenues of the Companies and nothing in this Agreement is intended to deal, directly or indirectly, with all or any portion of any proceeds of a sale of all or any part of the Companies or of any sale of the Companies' assets effected in connection with the sale of all or part of the Companies' business or the gain arising from the sale of assets of the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with part practice, all of which proceeds or gain shall, subject to the Articles and Applicable Law, be distributed to holders (the "Common Shareholders") of the Common Shares net of any taxes payable by the Companies with respect to any such sale.
 
(i) CGR shall mean, for any given financial period, all consolidated revenues after elimination of "intra-company revenues" of the Companies, from whatever source derived, calculated on an accrual basis, for such financial period, including, without limitation, Net Financial Income. "Intra-company revenues" shall mean the inter-company revenues of the Companies only, exclusive of the revenues derived from transactions with Legg Mason or other "Legg Entities" (as defined below), other than the Companies.
 
(ii) CVC shall mean, for any given financial period, the sum of all consolidated costs and expenses presented on Schedule A, after elimination of intra-company costs and expenses, for such period, calculated on an accrual basis, booked in accordance with US GAAP consistently applied, and as calculated in accordance with prior practices of the Companies, and relating to:
 
(A) Obligations pursuant to any distribution or similar agreements;
 
(B) Any contractual obligations for finders' fees or similar arrangements that relate to the generation of new AUM resulting in additional CGR;
 
(C) Depreciation and amortization relating to any financing of the payment of fees with respect to the distribution of B and C shares;
 
(D) Any marketing or promotional expenses required or necessary to support the generation or maintenance of AUM; and
 
(E) Any other costs and expenses as mutually agreed between the parties.
 
(iii) CS shall mean, in the case of any given financial period the group of direct and indirect entities consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of Permal for such financial period in accordance with US GAAP. However, for the purpose of the calculation of CGR and CVC:
 
(A) Each entity listed in Schedule B shall be consolidated in proportion to the direct or indirect equity interest in such entity held by Permal;
 
(B) Each entity listed in Schedule C shall be excluded except for any dividends and other distributions received from it;
 
(C) Entities, and in particular investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Permal, deemed to be consolidated under the FIN 46 rule, shall be excluded; and
 
(D) The methodology which would apply to each new entity, not currently part of the CS in which Permal and its wholly-owned subsidiaries would own less than 100% will be mutually agreed between the parties;
 
In addition, CVC will include the "Non-Deductible Amount" (as defined in Section 1(g) below) for the financial year in which it is incurred.
 
(iv) Net Financial Income shall mean (A) net interest, (B) dividends and similar distributions, and (C) net realized gains and losses on seed investments, in each
 
case paid or derived from investments in entities that are not included in the CS, all as determined in accordance with US GAAP consistently applied and as calculated in accordance with prior practices of the Companies. For purposes of this Agreement, "seed investments" shall mean initial investments in or commitments to new funds or other comparable investment vehicles.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CGR and CVC shall (i) exclude Legg Mason's "Losses" (as defined in Section 8.1 of the Acquisition Agreement), (ii) any costs, expenses and obligations for which Sellers are responsible under Section 6.11 of the Acquisition Agreement (collectively, "Tax Obligations"), and (iii) any distribution (a "Section 2.18 Distribution") made pursuant to Section 2.18 of the Acquisition Agreement. Such Losses and Tax Obligations shall be the responsibility of Legg Mason, subject to its rights of indemnification under the Acquisition Agreement, it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall adversely affect the rights of Legg Mason under the Acquisition Agreement or relieve the Principal Officers in their capacity as Management Shareholders of their obligation thereunder.
 
(b) . The Common Shareholders shall procure that for each financial year of Permal during the term of this Agreement, subject to the next paragraph of this Section 1(e):
Allocation of CNR
 
(i) Permal shall pay a dividend (the "Common Shareholders' Dividend) to the Common Shareholders equal to the applicable percentage of CNR for such financial year, determined in accordance with Schedule D attached hereto (such applicable percentage, the "EBIT Percentage"), subject, however, to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the deduction for taxes provided in Section
 
1(c)(i)(D); provided, however, that the Common Shareholders' Dividend shall be equal to the applicable percentage of CGR for such financial year, determined in accordance with Schedule E attached hereto (such applicable percentage, the "CGR Percentage"), subject, however, to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, if the amount of the Common Shareholders' Dividend as so determined is greater than the amount thereof determined in accordance with the preceding clause of this Section 1(b)(i); and
 
(ii) the Companies shall retain as Retained Net Operating Revenues ("RNOR") the applicable EBIT Percentage for such financial year, determined in accordance with Schedule D attached hereto (the "Retained EBIT Percentage") and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, or the applicable CGR Percentage for such financial year, determined in accordance with Schedule E attached hereto (the "Retained CGR Percentage") and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement, as the case may be.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) CGR shall not include, and in the case of this clause (i) RNOR shall include, in each financial period, that portion of any gross performance or incentive based fees in excess of 12% of the Companies' gross fixed fees and annual fees earned during such financial period; and (ii) CNR shall not include, and in the case of this clause (ii) RNOR shall include, in each financial period, that portion of any gross performance or incentive based fees in excess of 12% of the Companies' gross fixed fees and annual fees earned during such financial period (net of appropriate Distribution Fees corresponding to such excess).
 
In addition to the Common Shareholders' Dividend for any financial year, Permal, in the discretion of the Permal Board, may pay interim dividends ("Interim Dividends")
 
and may make loans to the Common Shareholders (the "Loans" and, together with the Interim Dividends and the Common Shareholders' Dividend, the "Common Shareholders' Payments) from time to time during such financial year; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Interim Dividends and Loans during any financial year shall be limited to the greater of the applicable EBIT Percentage of CNR or CGR Percentage of CGR during the "applicable period". The "applicable period" in any financial year, in the case of any such Interim Dividend or Loan, shall mean the financial period from the beginning of such financial year to the end of the financial quarter preceding the declaration of such dividend or the making of such loan, as the case may be. Each Loan shall be made on such terms as the Permal Board shall deem appropriate.
 
The Common Shareholders shall procure that Permal shall make distributions of the Common Shareholders' Payments within five (5) business days after the determination of the amount of the Common Shareholders' Payments pursuant to Section 1(e) below and, in the case of the Common Shareholders' Dividend or any Interim Dividend, the declaration thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Shareholders' Payments payable hereunder (including any Loans, as though they were Interim Dividends) shall be subject to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Shares to receive the Preferred Dividends on the Preferred Shares, as provided in the Articles. Any subsidiaries of Permal shall timely make any distributions to Permal which are required for Permal to make distributions of the Common Shareholders' Payments. The Companies shall have the same fiscal year-end as Legg Mason during the period that they are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Legg Mason.
 
The Common Shareholders' Dividend for any financial year shall be reduced, first, by the "Preferred Dividend" (as defined in the Articles) required to be paid on the Preferred
 
Shares, as provided in the Articles, second, by the amount of any Loans (including any accrued interest thereon) made in such financial year, and, third, by the amount of any Interim Dividends paid in such financial year; such Loans (and accrued interest) shall be deemed paid to the extent of such reduction applicable to them.
 
Nothing in this Section 1 shall oblige Permal to distribute Common Shareholders' Dividends and Interim Dividends which would exceed its distributable reserves or which would result in violation of applicable regulatory capital adequacy requirements, in each case as determined in accordance with applicable law. If the amount of the Common Shareholders' Payments for any financial year would exceed Permal's distributable reserves, or would result in such a violation, as so determined, the excess shall (subject to Section 1(f)) be added to the Common Shareholders' Payments due in subsequent financial years until all such excess has been paid.
 
Except as provided above in this Section 1 and in the Articles, the Common Shareholders shall not be entitled to any Common Shareholders' Payments so long as this Agreement shall be in effect, and the Common Shareholders agree to use their best efforts to have the "Boards" (as defined below in Section 2) act in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles in connection with authorizing or declaring any Common Shareholders' Payments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Articles.
 
(c) .
RNOR - Retained Net Operating Revenues
 
(i) Retained Net Operating Revenues shall be applied by the Companies to pay and provide for all of the Companies' expenses and expenditures, which shall be
 
determined in accordance with US GAAP ("Company Expenditures"), including, without limitation:
 
(A) all salaries and employee benefits of their employees;
 
(B) all expenses of the Companies payable to third parties;
 
(C) upon authorization of a Principal Officer, all intercompany expenses of the Companies from Legg Mason or its subsidiaries, other than the Companies (Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are individually referred to as a "Legg Entity," and collectively as "Legg Entities") including, without limitation, expenses incurred by Legg Entities;
 
(D) all expenses of the Companies for non-income related federal, state, local or foreign taxes, licenses or registration fees pertaining to the operations of the Companies after the closing under the Acquisition Agreement (except for any federal, state, local or foreign taxes on income of the Companies and the Legg Entities, which shall be withheld from the Common Shareholders' Payments and paid by the Company, but not treated as an expense of the Companies);
 
(E) depreciation and amortization;
 
(F) minor capital expenditures (which shall be expensed and not capitalized); and
 
(G) interest payments to Legg Mason pursuant to this Agreement.
 
In addition, in each case where a Common Shareholders' Payment is based on a CGR Percentage of CGR, RNOR shall be applied by the Companies to pay and provide for CVC for the financial period to which such Common Shareholder Payment pertains.
 
For purposes of this Agreement, a "minor capital expenditure" shall mean any single expenditure for real or personal property in the amount of $2,500 or less.
 
The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Companies to not incur expenses or obligations that exceed their ability to pay or provide for them when due out of RNOR.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Expenditures shall exclude (A) any expenses and expenditures to the extent taken into account in the calculation of CVC, (B) any Losses of Legg Mason, (C) any Tax Obligations, (D) any depreciation or amortization resulting from or related to the acquisition by Legg Mason of Equity Interests of Permal as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, and (E) any Section 2.18 Distributions.
 
(ii) If the Companies expect to request the funding of non-minor capital expenditures by Legg Mason, such funding shall be discussed in advance by the parties. If Legg Mason agrees to fund a non-minor capital expenditure, such expenditure shall be amortized on the books and records of the Companies over a period of time determined in accordance with Legg Mason's practice current at the time of the expenditure consistent with US GAAP, and Legg Mason's funding of such expenditure shall be repaid to Legg Mason in accordance with the amortization schedule, together with interest at the rate specified in Section 1(f)(C) hereof or such other rate agreed to by the parties. Legg Mason shall be under no obligation to agree to fund any capital expenditure, and any failure of Legg Mason to so agree shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.
 
(d) . To provide an incentive to the Principal Officers and other key employees of the Companies, the Companies shall establish an incentive compensation pool ("Incentive Pool") from which they will authorize distributions of bonuses to such employees ("Bonus Distributions"). The terms of any incentive compensation plan with respect to the Incentive Pool shall be determined by the Principal Officers, subject to Board approval. The Incentive Pool shall be equal to the balance (if any) of the RNOR remaining after subtraction of all Company Expenditures other than Bonus Distributions with respect to a financial year. The Management Committee of Permal pursuant to Section 2(b) (the "Management Committee")
Incentive Pool
 
shall recommend to the Permal Board (as hereinafter defined) the recipients and amounts of all Bonus Distributions. Bonus Distributions shall be paid for the period beginning on the date of the Initial Closing and ending on March 31, 2006 and for the semi annual periods ending on September 30 and March 31, thereafter, upon, and subject in all respects to, approval by the Permal Board, it being understood that Bonus Distributions for periods ending on March 31 will be paid during the following April, and those for the periods ending on September 30 will be paid during the following October; provided, however, that a Bonus Distribution for a period ending on March 31, will be subject to a 5% retention, with any adjustment in the amount of such Bonus Distribution as a result of the annual audit of the Companies' financial statements for such period to be applied against such retention and the balance thereof to be paid during the following May. The Common Shareholders and the Preferred Shareholders will use their best efforts to cause the members of the Board respectively designated by them to act pursuant to the preceding sentence in a reasonable and timely manner. Bonus Distributions shall not be paid in excess of the total of the current Incentive Pool. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Bonus Distributions shall be paid or committed to any employee of any of the Companies unless and until Permal is current with respect to its required distributions of the Common Shareholders' Payments, or, in lieu thereof, the payment in full of principal of and interest on all working capital loans made pursuant to Section 2(i). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall establish or be deemed to constitute an obligation of the Companies to any particular employee of any of the Companies to pay bonuses or other compensation to such employee, or restrict the right of the Companies to terminate the employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause.
 
(e) . The amount of CNR, the Common Shareholders' Payments, RNOR, Company Expenditures and the Incentive Pool shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement by the Permal Board: (i) within 30 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in a fiscal year based on the most recent unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements of the Companies; and (ii) within 30 days after the end of the last fiscal quarter based on the audited annual financial statements of the Companies. Any adjustments to the Common Shareholders' Dividend, which are required as a result of the year-end audit of the annual financial statements shall be made by appropriate adjustment to the amount to be paid for such last fiscal quarter.
Determination of Amounts
 
(f) . If Permal, for a reason other than as stated in the penultimate paragraph of Section l(b), fails to make a distribution under Section l(b) to the Common Shareholders of all or a portion of the Common Shareholders' Payments (notwithstanding the desire of the Permal Board to do so in the case of an Interim Dividend or a Loan), Legg Mason may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to deem the amount of such distribution to be a working capital loan to Permal which:
Conversion to Working Capital Loan
 
(A) has an original principal amount equal to the amount of such distribution;
 
(B) is payable on demand;
 
(C) bears interest at the rate of 50 basis points in excess of three-month LIBOR as published in on the day Legg Mason makes the election, compounded annually;
The Wall Street Journal
 
(D) may be prepaid by Permal at any time and from time to time; and
 
(E) at Legg Mason's request, shall be evidenced by a promissory note containing such other terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to Legg Mason.
 
(g) . In the event that (i) all or any portion of the base or incentive compensation, including Bonus Distributions, of any Company employee, or (ii) all or any portion of any other Company Expenditures (excluding, however, amortizable capital expenditures and repayment of the principal balance of any Company indebtedness), are, in the reasonable judgment of Legg Mason, not fully and currently deductible (unless the current nondeductibility is due solely to a timing difference between book and tax accounting that causes a particular Company Expenditure to be deductible for tax purposes in a financial year different from the financial year in which the expense was accrued under US GAAP) under federal or state tax laws, rules or regulations (including, without limitation, any judicial or administrative rulings or interpretation thereof), and the aggregate amount that is not so deductible would reduce the Common Shareholders' Payments for the financial year in which such amount was accrued under US GAAP, such aggregate amount to the extent that it is not currently deductible (the "Non-Deductible Amount") shall be deemed part of CVC for such financial year.
Nondeductibility of Expenses
 
(h) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Key-Man Life Insurance
 
(i) premiums payable on life insurance policies ("Key-Man Policies") on the life of a Principal Officer shall be paid either by funds provided by Legg Mason or out of the Common Shareholders' Payments in proportion to its ownership of Equity Interests in the Company at the time such premiums are due, with the balance of such premiums being considered Company Expenditures;
 
(ii) death benefit or other proceeds paid or payable under a Key-Man Policy as described in the preceding clause (i) shall be allocated between Legg Mason and the Companies in the same proportion as described in such clause, and the amount of such
 
death benefit or proceeds payable to Legg Mason shall be payable to it (at such times and in such amounts as Legg Mason elects in its sole discretion), in addition to any Common Shareholders' Payments to which the Common Shareholders are otherwise entitled pursuant to this Agreement; and
 
(iii) any death benefit or other proceeds paid or payable to the Companies under a Key-Man Policy shall not be considered CGR and shall be considered RNOR.
 
(i) . Each Common Shareholder agrees that it will not transfer any Common Shares, or any interest in any Common Shares, to any person, unless and until such person becomes a party to this Agreement as a Common Shareholder and agrees to be bound by the terms hereof.
Transfer of Common Shares

(a) With respect to any Covered Product, Citigroup shall cause each Citigroup Distributor to provide Legg Mason and its Affiliates (including, after the closing of the Transaction, CAM) substantially the same access to distribution by the applicable Citigroup Distributor or Distributors (i) with respect to an existing CAM Product or a CAM Product introduced after the date hereof and prior to the closing of the Transaction, on at least as favorable a basis as such Citigroup Distributor currently provides with respect to such CAM Product or provides to such new CAM Product on the date of the closing of the Transaction and (ii) with respect to any existing Legg Mason Product or, subject to Section 8(a), any Legg Mason Product or CAM Product introduced after the date of the closing of the Transaction, on at least as favorable a basis as such Citigroup Distributor that distributes CAM Products and Legg Mason Products provides to other investment products that would be generally viewed as competitive with the applicable Legg Mason Product or new CAM Product in the channel in question; that access for any of the foregoing products to distribution by such Citigroup Distributor shall be subject to the Applicable Standards and Practices of the applicable Citigroup Distributor with respect to investment products distributed by such Citigroup Distributor, and , , that where multiple compensation programs are utilized for similar or competitive products in a channel, the foregoing standard shall have been complied with if Legg

provided

Mason is permitted to determine which program it wishes to utilize. After the date hereof and prior to the closing of the Transaction, Citigroup agrees that it will not reduce the level of access that any of the existing CAM Products have to distribution by Citigroup Distributors. With respect to any Citigroup Distributor that does not at the time in question distribute Covered Products, Citigroup will, upon the request of Legg Mason, use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain distribution of Covered Products by such Citigroup Distributor on the same terms as provided by clauses (i) and (ii) above.
 
(b) The Citigroup Distributors shall have the exclusive right to distribute the Legg Mason Exclusive Equity Products for three years from the Commencement Date so long as:
 
 
 
The obligations under each of (i) and (ii) of this Section 4(b) are to be evaluated in light of conditions over the period in question, including but not limited to general economic conditions, general interest rates, equity market performance, mutual fund industry flows, consumer sentiment and the availability and investment performance of the Legg Mason Exclusive Equity Products.
 
 
 
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Legg Mason may permit any Legg Mason Exclusive Equity Products to be distributed (i) through the Existing Legg Mason Distribution Agreements, (ii) to True Institutional Accounts, (iii) with the consent of Citigroup (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it being understood that a meaningful adverse effect on the retention of "persons associated with a broker or dealer" (as defined in the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a reasonable withholding of such consent) to Retail Institutional Accounts; and (iv) subject to Section 6.18(b)(ii) of the Transaction Agreement, through Legg Mason's Fund Investors Services unit; provided that during the Exclusivity Period neither Legg Mason nor its Affiliates will enter into any selling agreements (other than renewals of Existing Legg Mason Distribution Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions, including, parties, covered products and limitations) to offer, or allow the distribution of, any Legg Mason Exclusive Equity Product with any wirehouse or regional brokers during the Exclusivity Period, subject to any Requirement of Law.
 
(d) Citigroup will cause any Citigroup Distributor that enters into a Selling Agreement with respect to a Covered Product pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement to not provide to its Sales Force for the sale of investment products that are not Covered Products and that would be generally viewed as competitive with the applicable Covered Products in the channel in question any compensation or economic inducement or benefit that is more favorable than that provided to such Sales Force for the sale of such Covered Products in such channel, provided, that this provision is not intended to prohibit a Citigroup Distributor from selling products that provide for different rates of sales load or Rule 12b-1 fees (e.g., Class A shares for different products or funds that have different sales load structures). For the avoidance of doubt, as an example of the foregoing, the Parties agree that any more favorable compensation or economic inducement or benefit shall not have occurred if a Covered Product and such competitive investment product that have the same pricing structure, and members of such Sales Force are entitled to varying dollar amounts of compensation as a result of the application of such pricing structure's breakpoints to different purchase amounts or the application of different payout ratios among the members of such Sales Force in accordance with the predetermined formula for payout ratio to the sales resulting from such purchase amounts.
 
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in case of a direct or indirect acquisition by Citigroup of the assets or business of another entity engaged in the distribution of investment products that would be generally viewed as competitive with the applicable Covered Products in the channel in question, (i) no such acquisition will limit or restrict any obligation of any Citigroup Distributor other than such acquired business to distribute Covered Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Selling Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) at the request of Legg Mason, Citigroup shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, subject to each Requirement of Law and any contractual provisions such acquired business is subject to immediately prior to the execution of the related acquisition agreement (provided that such contractual provision was not entered into in connection with, as a part of or in preparation for, such acquisition), to cause such acquired business to provide to Legg Mason and its Affiliates access to distribution by such acquired business on the same basis as set forth in Section 4(a).
 
(f) In the event that Legg Mason determines to recommend the merger or combination of any CAM Product that is a RIC or other pooled investment vehicle with any Legg Mason Product that is a RIC or other pooled investment vehicle, such merger or combination shall be, subject to applicable fiduciary duties and applicable Requirements of Law, effected in a manner designed to preserve (i) the commercial arrangements set forth herein and in any Selling Agreement related to such vehicle (e.g. commission/share class structure, 12b-1 fee, shareholder servicing or subadministration fee and revenue-sharing) and (ii) the preferential distribution rights that the Citigroup Distributors have pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of the merger or combination of any CAM Product with respect to which Legg Mason is required to make revenue sharing payments under this Agreement, into a Legg Mason Product with respect to which Legg Mason is not required to make revenue sharing payments under this Agreement, Legg Mason shall, until the expiration of the Exclusivity Period and subject to applicable fiduciary duties and Requirements of Law, make revenue sharing payments with respect to the net assets of the merged or combined CAM Product immediately prior to such merger or combination at the annualized amount applicable to such CAM Product at the most recent measurement period. Legg Mason will give reasonable prior notice to Citigroup of such determination to enable the Parties to plan for any such merger or combination.
 
(g) Subject to applicable Requirements of Law, Legg Mason will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Legg Mason Products that are RICs to continue to provide after the date of the closing of the Transaction, to the extent so provided as of the date of the Transaction Agreement, that shares of such Legg Mason Products sold by Citigroup Distributors (including through the PC/CM Business Channel prior to the date of the closing of the Transaction) may not be held in any manner other than in the name of a Citigroup Distributor or its nominee or in the name of the beneficial holder thereof. Subject to applicable Requirements of Law, Legg Mason agrees that the applicable Citigroup Distributors may take appropriate steps to ensure that shares of such Legg Mason Products sold by Citigroup Distributors (including through the PC/CM Business Channel prior to the date of the closing of the Transaction) may not be held in any manner other than in the name of a Citigroup Distributor or its nominee or in the name of the beneficial holder thereof.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baltimore, MarylandJune 24, 2005Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) announced today that it has signed definitive agreements regarding two strategic transactions, the combination of which will complete the transition of the firm into a major "pure play" global asset manager of equity and fixed income products. Upon completion of the transactions with Citigroup and Permal, Legg Mason's assets under management will aggregate over $830 billion

.
 
Under terms of the agreement with Citigroup, Legg Mason will acquire substantially all of Citigroup's worldwide asset management business ("CAM"), which includes $437 billion of assets under management, in exchange for (i) Legg Mason's private client brokerage and capital markets businesses; (ii) approximately $1.5 billion of Legg Mason common and non-voting convertible preferred shares; and (iii) approximately $550 million in the form of a five-year loan facility provided by Citigroup's Corporate and Investment Bank. The total value of this transaction is approximately $3.7 billion, subject to adjustments. The transaction excludes Citigroup's asset management business in Mexico, its retirement services business in Latin America and its interest in CitiStreet.
 
In a separate agreement, Legg Mason will acquire The Permal Group ("Permal"), one of the five largest funds-of-hedge-funds managers in the world, with approximately $20 billion of assets under management, from Sequana Capital and Permal Group management. Virtually all of these
 
LEGG MASON, INC.
News Release  June 24, 2005
Page 2
 
assets are managed on behalf of high net worth investors domiciled outside the United States. Under the terms of this transaction, Legg Mason will acquire an 80% interest in Permal at closing with the right to purchase the remaining 20% over the next four years. The initial payment at closing is expected to be $800 million, subject to potential downward adjustment, of which up to $200 million may at Legg Mason's option be in the form of Legg Mason common stock, and the remainder in cash. The residual 20% interest in Permal, which will be in the form of Permal preferred shares, will be subject to puts to and calls by Legg Mason in years 2 and 4, with payments based on a formula depending upon Permal's net revenues at the time, and subject to certain caps. The aggregate price for 100% of Permal is capped at $1.386 billion, with a $961 million floor. Legg Mason may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of Legg Mason common stock.
 
Permal's entire senior management team is expected to continue at the company under long-term employment agreements.
 
Legg Mason said that each of the above transactions is expected to be accretive to its GAAP earnings per share in the first year post-closing, subject to realizing certain cost savings in the CAM transaction. Each of the transactions will also generate substantial accretion to Legg Mason's cash earnings per share, also in year one.
 
Legg Mason's Board of Directors unanimously approved both transactions.
 
Transaction with Citigroup Enables Legg Mason to Focus Entirely on Asset Management
 
Legg Mason's chairman and chief executive officer, Raymond A. ("Chip") Mason, said, "As a result of these strategic initiatives, Legg Mason becomes a singularly focused, more profitable and certainly more influential organization within the global asset management community. We believe these transactions are in the best interests of our shareholders.
 
"The business swap with Citigroup should benefit both companies. On our part, we expect to more than double our assets under management, broaden our geographical reach into critical global markets and, through a joint three-year global distribution agreement, significantly expand our ability to distribute our retail money management products around the world through a financial powerhouse."
 
Upon completion of this transaction, Legg Mason will begin to distribute its asset management products broadly through the Citigroup system, including Smith Barney's enlarged broker force; Citigroup Private Bank (with over 470 private bankers); Citibank (with over 2,000 branches); Citigroup's Primerica operation (with over 100,000 Life/VA representatives); and CitiStreet, a 40l(k) joint venture.
 
The transaction will also further extend around the world Legg Mason's institutional and retail market reach, as the firm gains established operations in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Latin America, and builds on its existing presence in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore.
 
Mr. Mason added, "Another attractive aspect of this transaction is the strategic fit between Western Asset, our leading fixed income manager, and CAM's fixed income business. We believe there are opportunities to generate substantial strategic and economic benefits by combining CAM's fixed income business with Western Asset's."
 
LEGG MASON, INC.
News Release  June 24, 2005
Page 3
 
"We recognize the strategic and economic benefits to be realized by a carefully thought out and executed combination of the two organizations. We will work hard with the many talented professionals within CAM to integrate the two firms where appropriate which, when combined, will have the breadth, scale and distribution to be a major force in the asset management business for the long term."
 
Mr. Mason continued, "We believe this transaction is also good for our 1,354 Financial Advisors and clients. We are confident that our Financial Advisors will find a welcome new home at Smith Barney and that both they and their clients will benefit from an expanded array of bank-like products and services, in addition to the existing Legg Mason products and services they presently enjoy."
 
In reflecting on the swapping of its broker-dealer business as a part of the acquisition of CAM, Mr. Mason observed, "While the overall strategic and economic benefits of the transaction are exciting and clearly compelling for Legg Mason's stockholders, the separation of our brokerage business is in many ways a very poignant moment for us. We should never forget that our Financial Advisors formed the original foundation of this company. Their integrity, excellence, and unwavering focus on their clients' best interests helped make it possible for Legg Mason to grow into what it is today. My respect and admiration for each of them is unfailing. They are a first-class group and I have no doubt they will bring great value to Smith Barney and Citigroup by continuing to serve their clients in their new home with the same care and integrity they provide at Legg Mason today."
 
Permal Has Solid Business Model and Long History of Performance in New Asset Class for Legg Mason: Alternative Products
 
The acquisition of Permal adds a new market and attractive new business model to Legg Mason's family of asset managers. Permal also further diversifies Legg Mason's investment disciplines by adding expertise in managing multi-manager funds and alternative products.
 
Permal's client base consists primarily of high net worth individuals and families domiciled outside the United States. Through its principal offices in New York and London, and additional offices in Boston, Singapore, Dubai, Nassau and Paris, the company serves clients throughout Asia, South America, Europe and the Middle East. Permal also expects to open an office in Hong Kong over the next 12-15 months.
 
Mr. Mason commented, "Permal has established itself as a leading funds-of-hedge-funds manager outside the United States, and just this year has entered the United States. In its 30-year operating history, Permal has established a reputation for delivering the kind of consistent investment performance that has attracted investors to alternative investments: attractive returns with low volatility.
 
"Permal's long history in the alternative asset space sets it apart from its peers, and its consistent performance has enabled it to build broad and deep distribution relationships with world-class, geographically diverse partners. The addition of Permal will further enhance and diversify our growing asset mix and offer our shareholders excellent growth potential."
 
Mr. Mason concluded, "Permal has a great business model and a very sophisticated management team, under the leadership of Isaac Souede. We are pleased that Permal's entire team will be joining the Legg Mason family. And, as is the case with most of our larger asset management
 
LEGG MASON, INC.

Page 4
 
businesses, Permal will operate on a stand-alone basis, so we anticipate a very smooth and seamless transition to Legg Mason."
 
Strategic Benefits of the Transactions
 
The transactions together are expected to more than double Legg Mason's assets under management, to over $830 billion, and will enable the firm to focus on devoting its full energies as a "pure-play" global asset manager. Upon closing of these transactions:

Financial benefits of the transactions include:
 
 
 
The CAM transaction is expected to close in the December 2005 quarter. It is subject to regulatory and CAM mutual fund board and shareholder approvals and customary closing conditions. The Permal transaction is also expected to close by calendar yearend and is subject to regulatory
