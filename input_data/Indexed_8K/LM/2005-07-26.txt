Baltimore, Maryland  July 26, 2005  Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported its operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. In light of the pending sale of its Private Client and Capital Markets businesses, these businesses are accounted for as discontinued operations; the firm's continuing operations consist solely of its Asset Management business.
 
 
 
 
 
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
 
"Our Asset Management business, which will be our sole business after we close our transaction with Citigroup, had a very solid quarter, with net income up 40% year-over-year on a 25% increase in revenues, and assets under management up 34%. Western Asset's and Brandywine's results were particularly noteworthy, as each achieved more than 40% increases in their assets under management. Among our other managers, Legg Mason Capital Management and Private Capital Management had the strongest increases in managed assets, up 28% and 23%, respectively.

"Because of the pending sale of our brokerage operations, we now show our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses as discontinued operations. The results of these businesses were negatively affected by both the challenging market conditions during the quarter and, particularly for Capital Markets, their pending sale. We anticipate that these businesses will continue to be negatively affected by the distractions of the pending sale."
