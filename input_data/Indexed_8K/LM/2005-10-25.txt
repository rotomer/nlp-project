Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"Our Asset Management business had another solid quarter, with net income up 38% year-over-year on a 25% increase in revenues, and assets under management up 34%. Our Institutional and Mutual Funds businesses were particularly strong, achieving solid revenue increases in relation to both the June and year ago quarters. Most noteworthy were the results achieved by Western Asset: the firm's net client cash flows during the quarter totaled more than 5% of its assets under management at the beginning of the quarter.
"Asset Management will be our sole business after we close our transaction with Citigroup, anticipated for the December quarter.
"Our discontinued operations include our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses. Private Client's revenues and pre-tax profit margin were up from both the June and prior year quarters, while _____________________________
1 Assets under management included $5.0 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion attributable to discontinued operations as of September 30, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004, respectively.

Capital Markets' results were improved over the June quarter but continued lower than a year ago. Both businesses, we believe, have been negatively affected by the distractions of their pending sale."
Results from Continuing Operations for the Quarter
The revenues of our continuing operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $466.4 million, up 25% from $373.6 million in the prior year quarter.

Strong growth in assets under management experienced by each of our three asset management divisions -- Institutional, Mutual Funds and Wealth Management -- over the last 12 months resulted in strong growth in their fee revenues in comparison with the year ago period, with Western Asset's increases being particularly strong in both dollar and percentage terms.
