Baltimore, MD - February 1, 2006 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported its operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, which included results associated with the firm's strategic transaction with Citigroup, which closed on December 1st, and the acquisition of Permal, which closed on November 3rd.
Net income for the quarter, which totaled $760.3 million, included a $643.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of the firm's brokerage and capital markets operations as well as $16.1 million of income (net of tax) from such discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations, which totaled $100.8 million, up 28% from $79.0 million a year ago, included $24.6 million of transaction-related compensation costs (net of tax) related to the Citigroup transaction.
Net income per diluted share for the quarter totaled $5.80, including $4.91 from the gain on sale of our discontinued brokerage and capital markets businesses, $0.12 of income from those discontinued operations, and $0.77 of income from continuing operations, up 12% from $0.69 in the prior year quarter, on a 13% increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding, and up 3% from the September quarter, on a 6% increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding.
Assets under management aggregated $850.8 billion, of which $430.7 billion is attributable to Legg Mason's "legacy" managers, $400.8 billion is attributable to Citigroup Asset Management and $19.3 billion from Permal.
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"December was clearly a landmark quarter for Legg Mason. The acquisitions of the Citigroup Asset Management and Permal businesses enabled us to virtually double our assets under management while substantially increasing our global footprint. In fact, our assets managed for non-US clients now exceed $265 billion, or 31% of our total assets under management. As a result, we are now a much larger and broader, pure asset management company. The divestiture of our brokerage business, while certainly difficult on a personal level, enables us to focus solely on making Legg Mason, now one of the largest asset managers in the world, hopefully one of the most highly regarded asset managers in the world.
"I am both pleased by the results of our "legacy" Legg Mason asset management business this quarter and encouraged by the prospects of the Citigroup Asset Management and Permal businesses we have acquired.
"We recognize that many things make it difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons of our December 2005 results to our results in prior quarters. Our operating results in this quarter include two months of results from Permal, two months of results from our discontinued brokerage operations, and just one month of results from Citigroup Asset Management. The quarter also recognizes our

capital gain and related tax bill from the sale of our brokerage business, as well as certain transaction-related compensation costs, including certain retention costs related to the next six months' transition period. Yet minimal cost savings or other benefits that we expect from the consolidation and rationalization of our businesses are reflected in this quarter's results."
Results from Continuing Operations for the Quarter
The firm's operating revenues from continuing operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $689.0 million, up 68% from $410.9 million in the December 2004 quarter, and up 48% from $466.4 million in the September 2005 quarter, with the majority of the increases attributable to our two acquired businesses. Investment advisory fee revenues from separate accounts were $285.6 million, up 30% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially. Investment advisory fees from our proprietary funds were $281.7 million, up 136% year-over-year and up 105% sequentially.
Performance fee revenues included in the above totaled $27.7 million, up from $18.8 million in the year ago quarter, with the majority of the increase attributable to performance fees earned by Permal.
Distribution and service fee revenues totaled $114.9 million, up 72% since the December 2004 quarter and up 58% since the September 2005 quarter. Other revenues, which totaled $6.8 million, were up 23% year-over-year and up 54% sequentially.
The growth in our revenues that is not attributable to the acquisitions of Citigroup Asset Management and Permal was primarily a result of increases in the assets under management of our "legacy" managers over the last year and quarter, with Western Asset's increases being particularly strong in dollar terms, followed by Legg Mason Capital Management and Brandywine. The December 31, 2004 acquisition of Legg Mason Investment Counsel also contributed to the increase.
Income from continuing operations was $100.8 million, up 28% from the year ago quarter and up 9% from the September 2005 quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $0.77, up 12% from the year ago quarter on a 13% increase in the weighted average of diluted shares outstanding, and up 3% from the September quarter on a 6% increase in the weighted average of diluted shares outstanding.
Legg Mason's operating income margin was 22.4%, down from 30.4% year-over-year and 29.7% sequentially, and our pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 24.5%, down from 30.5% year-over-year and 31.7% sequentially; the current quarter's lower margins are primarily the result of the $40.0 million in transaction-related compensation charges we took in the quarter.
The firm's effective tax rate on continuing operations was 38.5% in the current quarter versus 36.9% a year ago and 37.6% in September.
As of December 31, 2005, Legg Mason's stockholders' equity was $5.6 billion, up from $2.2 billion a year ago. The firm had 125.2 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2005, up from 108.5 million shares a year ago, and 131.1 million weighted average diluted shares for the quarter, up from 116.4 million shares for the year ago quarter. Long-term debt increased to $1.2 billion from $0.8 billion at March 31, 2005.
