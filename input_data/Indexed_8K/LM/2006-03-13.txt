Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Underwriter against payment by the Underwriter of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities being sold by the Selling Stockholder to or upon the order of the Selling Stockholder by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account specified by the Selling Stockholder.

If the option provided for in Section 2(b) hereof is exercised after the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Stockholder will deliver the Option Securities (at the expense of the Company) to the Underwriter at Skadden's Offices at 10:00 AM, on the date specified by the Underwriter (which shall be within three Business Days after exercise of said option), against payment by the Underwriter of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Selling Stockholder hereto by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account specified by the Selling Stockholder. If settlement for the Option Securities occurs after the Closing Date, the Company and such Selling Stockholders will deliver to the Underwriter on the Settlement Date, and the obligation of the Underwriter to purchase the Option Securities shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates and letters delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6 hereof. 12
4. Offering by the Underwriter. It is understood that the Underwriter proposes to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Prospectus. 5. Agreements. (i) The Company agrees with the Underwriter that: (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless the Company has furnished the Underwriter a copy for its review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Underwriter reasonably objects. The Company will cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form reasonably approved by the Underwriter with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Underwriter of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Underwriter (1) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or prevention and, upon such issuance, occurrence or prevention, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or prevention, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. (b) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, if there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package, if prior to the availability of the Prospectus, or the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the 13
respective rules thereunder, including in connection with delivery or use of the Prospectus, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Underwriter of any such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (i)(a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (3) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Prospectus and (4) supply any supplemented Prospectus to the Underwriter in such quantities as the Underwriter may reasonably request. (d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriter an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act (it being understood that such delivery requirements shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the Company's compliance with the reporting requirements pursuant to the Exchange Act). (e) The Company will furnish to the Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriter, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by the Underwriter or any dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, if any, the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (g) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agrees with the Company, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule I hereto and any electronic road show. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Underwriter or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free 14
Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. (h) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any other shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock; or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period of 120 days after the date of this Agreement, provided, however, that the Company may issue and sell Common Stock, stock options and other Common Stock based securities or awards pursuant to any director stock option or equity plan, any employee benefit plan, stock ownership plan, stock purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company in effect at the Execution Time, the Company may issue Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of securities or the exercise of warrants or options outstanding at the Execution Time or in payment of outstanding shares of phantom stock outstanding at the Execution Time and the Company may issue shares of Common Stock as consideration pursuant to acquisitions and file registration statements with respect to such shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit the ability of Citigroup Inc. to exercise its rights under the Citigroup Registration Rights Agreement. (i) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities in violation of the Exchange Act. (j) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other Free Writing Prospectus that is included in the Disclosure Package, if any, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other Free Writing Prospectus that is included in the Disclosure Package, if any, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) the registration of the Securities under the Exchange Act and the listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (vi) any registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the 15

(including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriter relating to such filings); (viii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (ix) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the fees and expenses of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP) and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder. (ii) The Selling Stockholder agrees with the Underwriter that: (a) The Selling Stockholder will not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Selling Stockholder or any affiliate of the Selling Stockholder (except for the Underwriters) or any person in privity with the Selling Stockholder or any affiliate of the Selling Stockholder), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period of 120 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement, other than Securities to be sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder, provided, however, that this Section 5(ii)(a) shall not apply to transactions by the Selling Stockholder relating to shares of Common Stock solely in connection with sales of shares to index funds whose portfolios are primarily based on the Standard & Poor's Corporation 500 Composite Index, as the result of the inclusion of the Company in such index. (b) The Selling Stockholder will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities, provided, however, that the Selling Stockholder makes no covenant in this paragraph (b) as to any action by the Company or the Underwriter. (c) The Selling Stockholder will advise you promptly, and if requested by you, will confirm such advice in writing, so as long as delivery of a prospectus relating to the Securities by an underwriter or dealer may be required under the Act, of any material change in information in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus relating to the Selling Stockholder. 6.

Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriter and each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect 19
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter or the Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriter and each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have. The Underwriter and the Company acknowledge that the only information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder specifically for use in the Registration Statement, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto are the statements pertaining to the number of shares owned and the number of shares proposed to be sold by such Selling Stockholder. (c) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and the Selling Stockholder and each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to the Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to the liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph on the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" , (i) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (ii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids, in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by the Underwriter for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify 20
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnified party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnifying party is an actual or potential party to such claim or action). (e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and by the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall the Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by the Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the 21
Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder, and benefits received by the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Selling Stockholder shall not be obligated to make contributions hereunder which in the aggregate exceed the amount for which the Selling Stockholder would have been liable pursuant to paragraph (b), as limited by paragraph (f), of this Section 8 had indemnification been available thereunder. (f) The liability of the Selling Stockholder under the Selling Stockholder's representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the initial public offering price, net of underwriting discounts, of the Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter. 9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriter by notice given to the Company by the Underwriter, prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Underwriter, impractical or 22
inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers, of the Selling Stockholder and of the Underwriter set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Underwriter, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013, Attention: Syndicate Desk and copied to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, NY, 10036, Attention: Gregory A.

Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 14. No fiduciary duty. Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriter and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriter is acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Selling Stockholder or their respective affiliates, stockholders, employees or any other party and (c) the engagement of the Underwriter in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the 23
Company or the Selling Stockholder, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 15. Integration. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 17. Headings.

(b) The authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us. (c) The conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies. (d) As to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in the Agreement and in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company. (e) That the Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms. (f) That: (i) The Company is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. (ii) The Company has power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform, and has duly authorized, executed and delivered (except to the extent Generally Applicable Law is applicable to such execution and delivery), the Agreement. (iii) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not: (A) contravene its certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents; (B) except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to it; or (C) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on it of which any addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know.
(iv) Except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Agreement or, if any such authorization, approval, consent, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and is in full force and effect. We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions. "Generally Applicable Law" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Company, the Agreement or the transactions governed by the Agreement, and for purposes of assumption paragraph (f) above and our opinions in paragraphs 1, 2(a) below, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate. Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Company (a) has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the Agreement and (b) has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement. 2. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder will not, (a) result in a violation of the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or (b) result in a violation of Generally Applicable Law [or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award listed in Schedule A]. 3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any United States federal or New York governmental authority or regulatory body, [or any third party that is a party to any of the documents listed in Schedule A,] is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Agreement, except as have been obtained and are in full force and effect under the Securities Act or and as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in the United States in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities,
each of which has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and, to our knowledge, has not been withdrawn. 4. The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. 5. The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when issued and delivered as provided in the Agreement, the Securities will be validly issued, and the Common Stock will be fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of such Securities will not be subject to preemptive or similar rights under the Company's certificate of incorporation [or documents listed on Schedule Z]. 6. The Company is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 7. The statements in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Capital Stock" and "Plan of Distribution" and in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Underwriting" in each case, insofar as such statements constitute summaries of documents referred to therein, fairly summarize in all material respects the matters referred to therein. Our opinions expressed above are limited to (i) Generally Applicable Law and, (ii) in the case of our opinion in paragraph 6 above, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
