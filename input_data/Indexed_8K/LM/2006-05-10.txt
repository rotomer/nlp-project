Baltimore, MD - May 10, 2006 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE:LM) today reported operating results for both its fiscal fourth quarter and its fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The fourth quarter was the first period to reflect a full three months of the acquisitions of Citigroup Asset Management (CAM) and The Permal Group (Permal), which closed effective December 1, 2005 and November 1, 2005, respectively.
Fiscal year results showed growth from acquisitions:
Income from continuing operations was $433.7 million, up 47% from $295.4 million in fiscal 2005. Net income rose 180% to $1.1 billion, inclusive of a $644.0 million gain on the sale of our securities brokerage and capital markets business.
Total operating revenues increased 68% to $2.6 billion.
Diluted earnings per share for the year rose 149% to $8.80 including a non-recurring gain of $4.94 per share from the sale of our brokerage and capital markets businesses. Weighted average diluted shares increased 11% to 130.3 million due primarily to the issuance of common and non-voting convertible preferred shares in connection with the acquisition of CAM.
Cash income from continuing operations rose 46% for the year to $527.1 million ($4.06 per diluted share). (See discussion on page 4).
Assets under management (AUM) increased for the year by $493 billion, or 132%, to $868 billion, including the substantial client assets of the CAM and Permal businesses. Net positive client cash flows of approximately $36 billion, or 10% of AUM as of March 31, 2005, reflected in excess of $50 billion of net positive client cash flows of long-term assets at our legacy managers and net positive client cash flows at Permal, partially offset by net outflows of long-term assets from CAM, as well as approximately $16 billion of net outflows of liquidity assets.

News Release - May 10, 2006
The quarter's results reflect our singular focus on the asset management business:
Income from continuing operations was $151.6 million, an increase of 76% over last year's fourth quarter. Net income was $150.1 million, up 28% over the comparable period last year.
Total operating revenues increased 141% to $1.1 billion.
Diluted earnings per share, calculated on a 20% increase in weighted average shares, rose 5% to $1.03.
Cash income from continuing operations was $196.3 million ($1.35 per diluted share). (See discussion on page 4).
AUM increased for the quarter by approximately $17 billion, attributable primarily to positive market returns. Net positive client cash flows of approximately $2 billion reflected continuing net positive client cash flows of long-term assets at our legacy managers and Permal, largely offset by net outflows of long-term assets from CAM, and approximately $11 billion of net outflows of liquidity assets.
Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and chief executive officer, stated, "We have made meaningful progress during the last three months in integrating the former CAM businesses - assets, employees and systems - into Legg Mason, and have begun the task of rationalizing the former CAM product line into one that reflects Legg Mason's longstanding focus on providing institutional quality investment products and client service. Our timetable to complete this integration appears to be on target with little if any slippage.
"Financial results will continue to be confusing as we go through the process of employee reductions, redundancy, dual systems, stay bonuses and adjusting to our new size. As I have stated in the past, it will probably be difficult until the September quarter to show results that reflect our actual and future earnings capacity.
"Most of our primary asset managers had solid positive asset flows during the March quarter. Permal, percentage-wise, was very strong. Brandywine, Royce, Legg Mason Capital Management, and legacy Western Asset Management had very solid positive net asset flows."
Consolidated Results for the Year Ended March 2006 vs. March 2005
Total operating revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2006 increased to $2.6 billion from $1.6 billion in the previous fiscal year. The most significant factor in the increase was the effect of the two acquisitions. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were $1.2 billion, up 40% from $821.0 million in the previous fiscal year, due primarily to the acquisition of CAM. Investment advisory fees from funds were $1.0 billion, up 127% from $460.6 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of acquisitions.

Net income for fiscal 2006 includes income from continuing operations of $433.7 million ($3.35 per diluted share), an increase of 47% over the previous year. Discontinued operations, net of taxes, generated income of $66.4 million ($0.51 per diluted share), compared with $113.0 million ($0.97 per diluted share) in the prior year, representing a decrease of 41% due primarily to the sale of our brokerage and capital markets businesses on December 1, 2005. Also included in net income is a gain of $644.0 million ($4.94 per diluted share) on the sale of discontinued operations. The firm's effective tax rate for the year was 38.5%, compared with 37.2% the prior year.
The operating income margin for the year decreased to 26% from 31% primarily due to a significant increase in fund revenues of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. In addition, full year results include $53.1 million of transaction related compensation costs, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.25.
Consolidated Results for the Quarter Ended March 2006 vs. March 2005
Total operating revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were up 141% to $1.1 billion, reflecting three months of results from CAM and Permal, and increased revenues by many of the company's other asset managers. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts and proprietary funds were $377.0 million (up 61%) and $501.2 million (up 307%), respectively. Distribution and service fees were $168.3 million, an increase of 137% over the prior year period. Revenues include performance fees of $47.5 million, which represent less than 5% of operating revenues. These fees were attributable principally to Permal.
Net income for the quarter rose 28% to $150.1 million. Income from continuing operations for the quarter rose 76% to $151.6 million. Discontinued operations, for the quarter, net of taxes, generated a loss of $2.2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) compared with income of $31.6 million ($0.26 per diluted share) in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share rose 5% to $1.03 despite a 20% increase in weighted average shares outstanding over the prior year period.
The operating income margin for the quarter decreased to 23% from 33%, primarily due to an increase in fund revenues resulting from the CAM and Permal acquisitions. A substantial portion of such revenue is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. During the quarter, the Company also incurred $13.1 million in transaction related compensation expense, including certain retention costs, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.05. The Company expects that the completion of headcount reductions in the June 2006 quarter under the restructuring plan associated with the integration of CAM will generate meaningful aggregate quarterly savings.

Assets Under Management
At March 31, 2006, assets under management aggregated $867.6 billion, compared with $374.5 billion a year ago and $850.8 billion as of December 31, 2005. The $16.8 billion increase in the last three months was attributable primarily to positive market returns. Our net client inflows for the quarter were $1.6 billion, which reflects continuing net positive client cash flows of long-term assets at our legacy managers and Permal, and approximately $11 billion of net outflows of liquidity assets.
Our Institutional and Wealth Management divisions experienced net positive client flows for the quarter. As of March 31, 2006, our Institutional division had $444.8 billion under management (51% of total), while Mutual Funds/Managed Services had $356.5 billion (41%), and Wealth Management had $66.3 billion (8% of total). Non-US domiciled clients accounted for 30% of total assets under management, which compares with 24% of non-US client assets at March 31, 2005. Fixed income assets under management aggregated $394.2 billion, or 45% of our total assets under management, while equity assets accounted for $324.9 billion or 38%, and liquidity assets represented $148.5 billion, or 17%.
Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2006
Stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2006 was $5.85 billion, up 155% from $2.29 billion a year ago, primarily because of acquisitions and the results of operations for the year. Long-term debt totaled $1.2 billion, compared with $811 million at March 31, 2005.
Use of Cash Income from Continuing Operations as a Non-GAAP Performance Measure
As supplemental information, Legg Mason is providing a "non-GAAP" performance measure for "cash income from continuing operations" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating the operating performance of the Company and its subsidiaries. We define "cash income from continuing operations" as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and stock-based compensation costs. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Legg Mason considers cash income from continuing operations to be a useful representation of its operating performance because it represents Legg Mason's income from continuing operations adjusted for certain non-cash items.
In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the after tax impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non-cash expense does not

represent an actual decline in the value of the intangible assets. Deferred taxes on intangible assets, including goodwill, represent the actual tax benefits that are not expected to be realized for GAAP purposes. Since these deferred tax assets are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business, we add them to income from continuing operations in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Stock-based compensation costs are non-cash expenses and therefore are also added to income from continuing operations to calculate cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. For the calculation of diluted cash income per share from continuing operations, the diviso r is the number of total weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. A reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Cash income from continuing operations is presented on page 10.
