Baltimore, Maryland - October 24, 2006 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today announced that its net income in the quarter ended September 30, 2006 rose 19% from the September 2005 quarter to $143.7 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.00, up 1%, and include the effect of a 17% increase in weighted average shares outstanding. The Company's results were higher than in the prior year period primarily as a result of the Company's acquisitions of Citigroup's asset management business and the Permal Group in the 2006 third fiscal quarter.
The quarter results include:
Total assets under management grew to a record $891.4 billion during the quarter, with $20.3 billion of the $36.7 billion increase due to market appreciation and $16.4 billion of the increase due to positive net client cash flows.
Although all three asset classes - fixed income, equity and liquidity - ended the quarter with higher assets under management, the lower level of average equity assets during the quarter resulted in a 1% reduction in revenues to $1.0 billion primarily due to reduced revenues related to equity funds.
Income from continuing operations was $143.7 million ($1.00 per diluted share) compared to $156.0 million ($1.08 per diluted share) in the June quarter.
Cash income from continuing operations (see page 4) of $191.1 million ($1.32 per diluted share) was 6% lower than $202.6 million ($1.40 per diluted share) during the June quarter.
Distribution and servicing expenses include approximately $12 million (or $0.04 per diluted share) of unanticipated distribution expenses payable by our acquired business to our principal third-party distributor that related to prior quarters and approximately $5 million of distribution expenses from those same arrangements that relate to the current quarter.
Total compensation and benefits expense declined by over $11 million from the June quarter, primarily reflecting the elimination of certain expenses related to transitioning personnel as part of the integration of the acquired Citigroup business.
The pre-tax profit margins from continuing operations were 23% and 24% for the September 2006 and June 2006 quarters, respectively. The pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted for distribution and servicing expenses (see page 4), was 32% in the September 2006 quarter and 33% in the June 2006 period.

News Release - October 24, 2006
Commenting on the results, Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman and CEO, said:
"Our assets under management ended the quarter at a record $891.4 billion, which represents an increase of $36.7 billion, or 4%, over June's levels. Just over half ($20.3 billion) of the increase was attributable to market appreciation, with the remainder ($16.4 billion) coming from positive net client flows. We achieved increases in all three of our asset classes - fixed income, equity and liquidity - during the quarter.
"The integration of Citigroup Asset Management into Legg Mason/Western Asset remains on schedule. Most of the integration is expected to be completed by calendar year-end with some spillover into the March quarter.
"As you know, we have had weak equity performance from some of our key managers and that has affected revenues, assets under management, and profits.
"While we were certainly disappointed by the results for the September quarter, we are encouraged by the fact that we entered the December quarter with higher levels of assets under management and a better equity market environment."
Assets Under Management
Assets under management ended the quarter at a record $891.4 billion, up $36.7 billion, or 4%, from $854.7 billion in June. Market appreciation was responsible for $20.3 billion of the increase and positive net client cash flows contributed $16.4 billion.
Assets under management in all three of our asset classes - fixed income, equity and liquidity - increased during the quarter, with fixed income and liquidity being particularly strong, up 5% and 10%, respectively. Market appreciation drove a 1% increase in equity assets, which experienced net outflows of approximately $5 billion during the quarter. At quarter end, fixed income assets aggregated $440.8 billion (or 50% of our total AUM), while equity assets aggregated $315.6 billion (or 35%) and liquidity assets aggregated $135.0 billion (or 15%).
Also during the quarter, our Institutional division increased its assets under management by 4%, to $471.4 billion (or 53% of our total AUM), while our Managed Investments division's assets increased by 5%, to $355.7 billion (or 40%). Our Wealth Management division's assets were essentially unchanged, ending the quarter at $64.3 billion (or 7%). Our Institutional and Managed Investments divisions had positive net client cash flows during the quarter.
Assets managed for U.S.-domiciled clients increased by 5% during the quarter, to $636.3 billion (or 71% of our total AUM), while assets managed for non-U.S. domiciled clients increased by 3%, to $255.1 billion (or 29% of our total AUM).

Consolidated Results for the Second Quarter
Revenues and income from continuing operations increased significantly over the prior year's second quarter due principally to the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of Permal. Total operating revenues for the September 30, 2006 quarter were $1.0 billion, compared to $466.4 million in the prior year. Income from continuing operations before income tax provision and minority interests increased to $238.7 million from $147.7 million in September 2005; income from discontinued operations before income taxes was $47.9 million in the September 2005 quarter. Net income of $143.7 million ($1.00 per diluted share) rose 19% from $121.0 million ($0.99 per diluted share) the prior year. Weighted average shares outstanding rose 17% during the period compared to a year ago.
The Company's pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 23% versus 32% the prior year. The pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see page 4), was 32% compared to 38% in last year's comparable quarter. Cash income from continuing operations (see page 4) of $191.1 million was 82% higher than in the year ago quarter.
In comparison with the quarter ended June 30, 2006, revenues of $1.0 billion were down slightly despite the increase in assets under management at quarter end, primarily due to the lower level of average equity assets during the quarter, which resulted in reduced revenues. Performance fees during the period of $23.7 million were up $5.7 million from the June quarter.
Operating income totaled $235.0 million, compared with June results of $257.4 million. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.8%, compared with 38.3% in the June quarter. Net income for the September quarter was $143.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $156.0 million, or $1.08 per diluted share in the June quarter.
Consolidated Results for the Fiscal Year to Date
Total revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2007 were $2.1 billion, up 129% from the previous year period primarily as a result of the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of the Permal Group. Income from continuing operations of $299.7 million represented an increase of 65% over last year, due also to the addition of the acquired businesses. Income from discontinued operations in the first six months of fiscal 2006 was $52.5 million ($0.43 per diluted share). Discontinued operations reflect the Company's private client and capital markets businesses, which were sold to Citigroup. Net income was $299.7 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, compared with $233.8 million, or $1.92 per diluted share. Weighted average shares increased 17% to 144.2 million from 122.8 million in the prior year period due primarily to the acquisitions.
The pre-tax profit margin for the first six months was 24% versus 32% the prior year. The pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see page 4), was 33% versus 38% last year. Cash income from continuing operations of $393.7 million was 92% higher than in the first six months of fiscal 2006.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Cash Income from Continuing Operations
As supplemental information, Legg Mason is providing a "non-GAAP" performance measure for "cash income from continuing operations" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating the operating performance of the Company and its subsidiaries. We define "cash income from continuing operations" as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and stock-based compensation costs. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Legg Mason considers cash income from continuing operations to be a useful representation of its operating performance because it represents Legg Mason's income from continuing operations adjusted for certain non-cash items.
In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the after tax impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non-cash expense does not represent an actual decline in the value of the intangible assets. Deferred taxes on intangible assets, including goodwill, represent the actual tax benefits that are not expected to be realized for GAAP purposes. Since these deferred tax assets are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business, we add them to income from continuing operations in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Stock-based compensation is added back since it is a non-cash expense. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimate ly require replacement. For the calculation of diluted cash income per share from continuing operations, the divisor is the number of total weighted average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. A reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Cash income from continuing operations is presented on page 10.
Pre-Tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations Adjusted for Distribution and Servicing Expense
Legg Mason believes that pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is an effective measure of the Company's margin and a useful disclosure to investors because it subtracts from revenues the distribution and servicing expenses that are paid to third party distributors as direct costs of selling the products. This measure is provided in addition to the Company's pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins,

of other companies. A reconciliation of consolidated pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted, to pre-tax profit margin under GAAP, is presented on page 11.
