Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the respective Issuing Lender of the contents thereof, and shall notify each other Lender of the Administrative Agent's receipt of such request.
(b) Participations in Letters of Credit. On each day during the period commencing with the issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Commitment of each Lender shall be deemed to be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the then undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit. Each Lender agrees that, upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit hereunder, it shall automatically acquire a participation in the respective Issuing Lender's liability under such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such liability, and each Lender thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be unconditionally obligated to such Issuing Lender to pay and discharge when due, its Commitment Percentage of such Issuing L ender's liability under such Letter of Credit.

The Borrower hereby unconditionally agrees to (i) pay and reimburse the Administrative Agent forthwith for account of such Issuing Lender for the amount of each demand for payment under such Letter of Credit that is in substantial compliance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit at the later of (x) the Business Day on which such Issuing Bank shall have notified the Borrower of such payment and (y) the date on which payment is to be made by such Issuing Lender to the beneficiary thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind and (ii) pay interest to the Administrative Agent for account of such Issuing Lender on such amount from the date such Issuing Lender made the corresponding payment under such Letter of Credit until the date such payment by the Borrower is made at the rate set forth in Section 2.06(b).
(d) Notice by the Borrower of Borrowing for Reimbursement. Forthwith upon its receipt of a notice referred to in clause (c) of this Section 2.18, the Borrower shall advise the Administrative

(e) Payments by Lenders to Issuing Lenders. Each Lender shall forthwith pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the respective Issuing Lender at its Domestic Lending Office in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of any payment under a Letter of Credit upon notice by such Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) to such Lender requesting such payment and specifying such amount. Each such Lender's obligation to make such payment to the Administrative Agent for account of such Issuing Lender under this clause (e), and such Issuing Lender's right to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this clause (e), the financial condition of the Borrower, the existence of any Default or the termination of the Commitments or any other circumstanc e whatsoever. Each such payment to an Issuing Lender shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If any Lender shall default in its obligation to make any such payment to the Administrative Agent for account of an Issuing Lender, for so long as such default shall continue the Administrative Agent may at the request of such Issuing Lender withhold from any payments received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement for account of such Lender the amount so in default and, to the extent so withheld, pay the same to such Issuing Lender in satisfaction of such defaulted obligation.
(f) Participations in Reimbursement Obligations. Upon the making of each payment by a Lender to an Issuing Lender pursuant to clause (e) of this Section 2.18 in respect of any Letter of Credit, such Lender shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire (i) a participation in an amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation owing to such Issuing Lender by the Borrower hereunder and under the Letter of Credit Documents relating to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) a participation in a percentage equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage in any interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder and under such Letter of Credit Documents in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation (other than the commissions, charges, costs and expenses payable to such Issuing Lender pursuant to clause (g) of this Section 2.18). Upon receipt by an Issuin g Lender from or for account of the Borrower of any payment in respect of any Reimbursement Obligation or any such interest or other amount (including by way of set-off or application of proceeds of any collateral security) such Issuing Lender shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender entitled thereto such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such payment, each such payment by such Issuing Lender to be made in the same money and funds in which received by such Issuing Lender. In the event any payment received by an Issuing Lender and so paid to the Lenders hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by such Issuing Lender, each Lender shall, upon the request of such Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent), repay to such Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) the amount of such payment paid to such Lender, with interest at the rate specified in clause (j) of this Section 2.18.

Not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day preceding the date of issuance of any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall request confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such issuance would not cause the limitations set forth in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of this Section 2.18 to be exceeded, and such Issuing Lender shall not issue such Letter of Credit if (x) the Administrative Agent advises such Issuing Lender that such limitations would be exceeded or (y) the Administrative Agent notifies such Issuing Lender that the Administrative Agent has been advised by any other Lender or the Borrower that a condition precedent under Section 3.02 relating to such issuance has not been satisfied.
(j) Interest Payable to Issuing Lenders by Lenders. To the extent that any Lender shall fail to pay any amount required to be paid pursuant to clause (e) or (f) of this Section 2.18 on the due date therefor, such Lender shall pay interest to the respective Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) on such amount from and including such due date to but excluding the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate, provided that if such Lender shall fail to make such payment to such Issuing Lender within five Business Days of such due date, then, retroactively to the due date, such Lender shall be obligated to pay interest on such amount at the Base Rate.
(k) Modifications and Supplements. The issuance by an Issuing Lender of any modification or supplement to any Letter of Credit hereunder shall be subject to the same conditions as are applicable under this Section 2.18 to the issuance of new Letters of Credit, and no such modification or supplement shall be issued hereunder unless either (i) the respective Letter of Credit affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally been issued hereunder in such modified or supplemented form, or (ii) each Lender shall have consented thereto.

and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Section 6.01. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Cash Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposit shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the Cash Collateral Account.

October __, 2005
Citibank, N.A., individually and as Administrative Agent and the Lenders set forth on Schedule I
Re: Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of October 14, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement") among Legg Mason, Inc., the Lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Deputy General Counsel of Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Borrower"). This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinions set forth below, I, or attorneys under my supervision (collectively, the "Legal Department"), have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to the Legal Department's satisfaction, of the documents set forth below:
the Credit Agreement;
The Notes issued on the date hereof by the Borrower to the following Lenders: [__________];
Copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Borrower, each as amended and in effect as of the date hereof, as certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Borrower;
A certificate issued by the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation ("SDAT"), dated [______], to the effect that the Borrower is duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland;
Resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Borrower adopted on June 22, 2005, certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Borrower;
A certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower dated as of the date hereof, as to certain matters pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement (the "Officer's Certificate");
A certificate of the Assistant Secretary of the Borrower dated as of the date hereof, as to certain corporate items pertaining to the Borrower; and
Such other records, agreements, instruments, certificates and documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed herein.
Unless otherwise indicated, any reference herein to "documents" or "such documents" is intended as a reference to all of the documents submitted to the Legal Department for review in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents. For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures and the authority of all Persons signing the documents on behalf of parties thereto (other than the Borrower); (ii) the legal capacity of natural persons and the due organization, valid existence and good standing of each party who is not a natural person (other than the Borrower); (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to the Legal Department as originals; (iv) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to the Legal Department as certified, conformed or photostatic copies; (v) that all final Loan Documents have been executed and delivered in substantially the form of the final execution dra fts submitted to the Legal Department by your counsel for review; (vi) that there have been submitted to the Legal Department all amendments, modifications, exhibits, supplements and schedules to and of the Loan Documents which the Legal Department has reviewed for purposes of this opinion; (vii) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all Loan Documents by the parties thereto (other than the Borrower) in the form of the final execution drafts submitted to the Legal Department for review; (viii) that the execution, delivery and performance or observance by the parties thereto of the Loan Documents have not, and will not, conflict with or be in any way restricted by any contract or agreement of or affecting any party (other than the Borrower), any of its affiliates or any of their respective properties; (ix) the legal existence, qualifications and good standing in all appropriate jurisdictions of each party to the Loan Documents, other than the good standing of the Borrower in the State of Maryland; (x) the power and authority of each party to the Loan Documents (other than the Borrower) to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations thereunder; and (xi) that each of the Loan Documents is the binding obligation of the parties thereto (other than the Borrower) and is enforceable under the laws of the State of New York against such parties in accordance with its terms and provisions. As to any facts material to this opinion which the Legal Department did not independently establish or verify, I have relied upon certificates, reports, statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Borrower; and I have assumed the accuracy as of the date hereof of all representations of fact set forth in each of the documents by each party thereto including, without limitation, the Borrower.
In basing the opinions and other matters set forth herein on "my knowledge", the words "my knowledge" signify that no information has come to my attention that would give me actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate or that any of the documents, certificates, reports and information on which I have relied are not accurate and complete. The words "my knowledge" and similar language used herein are intended to be limited to the knowledge of myself and other attorneys working under my supervision in the Legal Department of the Borrower.
On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
1. Except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower is qualified to do business in, and in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
2. The Borrower (a) is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and (b) has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted.
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and each of the Notes, and the borrowing of Loans by it (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and except for the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which is required to be filed within 4 business days of the date on which the Credit Agreement is executed, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation, or order that to my knowledge exists, of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate its charter, by-laws or other organizational document and (d) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument identified in the accompanying Officer's Certificate as a "Material Agreement", or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be ma de by the Borrower.
4. There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to my knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) as to which there exists a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (b) that involve the Credit Agreement or, except for (i) lawsuits filed, and threatened lawsuits, in connection with voting and soliciting of proxies for closed-end mutual funds managed by subsidiaries of Citigroup Inc. and (ii) threatened lawsuits on behalf of Guillermo Menndez and related entities, the Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
5. The Borrower is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
My opinions set forth above are also subject to the following qualifications, exclusions, limitations and assumptions:
a. My opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding the principles of conflicts of laws thereof, and, with respect to paragraph 5 above, the federal laws of the United States of America, as in effect as of the date hereof. I express no opinion as to the laws of any other state or jurisdiction, and I can accept no responsibility for the applicability or effect of any such laws. In addition, I assume no obligation to supplement the opinions expressed herein if any applicable laws change, or if I become aware of any facts or circumstances that affect such opinions, after the date hereof.
b. I express no opinion as to whether there are any oral modifications or amendments to any of the Loan Documents, nor as to whether there has been any waiver of any of the provisions of any of the documents by action of the parties or otherwise.
c. This letter is strictly limited to the matters expressly set forth hereof and no statements or opinions should be inferred beyond such matters.
I call your attention to the Report of the Special Joint Committee on Lawyers' Opinions in Commercial Transactions of the Maryland State Bar Association, Inc. and The Bar Association of Baltimore City dated January 18, 1989, and published in , volume 45, number 2 (February 1990) at page 705, which report guides me in the preparation and delivery of legal opinions in commercial transactions. This reference is not intended to incorporate any of the assumptions or qualifications set forth in such report which are not also set forth in this opinion.

To the Persons listed in Schedule A
Legg Mason, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the ""), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 14, 2005 (the ""), among the Company, as Borrower, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the Lender parties referred to therein. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Company
Credit Agreement
In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
The Credit Agreement.
The Notes dated the date hereof.
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to herein as the "".
Opinion Documents
Originals or copies of such other records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and agreements and other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In our review of the Opinion Documents and other documents, we have assumed:
The genuineness of all signatures.
The authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us.
The conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies.
As to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in the Credit Agreement and the other Opinion Documents and in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company.
That each of the Opinion Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms.
That:
The Company is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
The Company has full power to execute, deliver and perform, and has duly executed and delivered, the Opinion Documents to which it is a party.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Opinion Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not:
contravene its certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents;
except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to it; or
result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on it of which any addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know.
Except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of any Opinion Document to which it is a party or, if any such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and is in full force and effect.
We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
"Generally Applicable Law" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is, and each other Note when duly executed and delivered for value will be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
Our opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications:
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
The effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
Our opinions are limited to Generally Applicable Law.
A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

To the Lenders that are parties to the     Revolving Credit Agreement referred to below     and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative     Agent for such Lenders (the "")
Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special New York counsel to the Administrative Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of October 14, 2005 (the "") among Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the ""), the financial institutions referred to as "Lenders" in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the "") and the Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement have the same respective defined meanings when used herein.
Revolving Credit Agreement
Borrower
Lenders
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined an executed counterpart of the Revolving Credit Agreement. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement. We have also assumed that the Revolving Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Borrower) constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized and that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Revolving Credit Agreement constitutes, and each Note when duly executed and delivered for value will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower party thereto, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(A) The enforceability of provisions in the Revolving Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(B) The enforceability of Section 8.04(b) of the Revolving Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(C) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) Section 8.03(b) of the Revolving Credit Agreement, (iii) Section 2.12 of the Revolving Credit Agreement, (iv) the first sentence of Section 8.07(b) of the Revolving Credit Agreement insofar as such sentence relates to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Revolving Credit Agreement or (iv) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 8.07(c) of the Revolving Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction.
This opinion letter is provided to you by us as special New York counsel to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Revolving Credit Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Revolving Credit Agreement without our prior written consent in each instance.
