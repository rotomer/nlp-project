Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Security, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company), or the custodian for the Global Security at the direction of the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company), shall make a notation on such Global Security as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Securities effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
(f)
Upon the conversion of any Securities, the accrued but unpaid interest attributable to the period from the issue date of the Securities to the Conversion Date, with respect to the converted Securities, shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the cash (including a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any) and shares of Common Stock, if any, in exchange for the Securities being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
Section 10.03

If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Security or Securities, the Company shall make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash to the Holder of
Securities at a price equal to the Closing Sale Price on the last Trading Day of the Conversion Observation Period.
Section 10.04  
.  Conversion Rate.
Each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities shall be convertible into cash and/or the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, based upon the Conversion Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10.05 and Section 10.06.  The Company shall settle its obligation to convert the Securities as provided in Section 10.13.
Section 10.05  
.   Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company, without duplication, as set forth in this Section 10.05.
(a)
In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (ii) split the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of such shares or combine outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of such shares, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

An adjustment to the conversion rate made pursuant to this clause (a) will become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date or effective date of such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination, as applicable.  
To the extent that a dividend, distribution, share split or share combination of the type described in this Section 10.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared.
(b)
In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issue rights or warrants (other than rights or warrants referred to in Section 10.05(c)) to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the date of such distribution, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

An adjustment to the conversion rate made pursuant to this clause (b) will become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such issuance.  
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such rights or warrants had not been issued.  
(c)
In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than the Common Stock), or evidences of our Indebtedness or other assets or property or rights, or warrants to acquire shares of Capital Stock of the Company or other securities (any of the foregoing, the ""), to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends or distributions described in clauses (a) or (b) of this Section 10.05, (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, (iii) any dividends and distributions in connection with a reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance resulting in a change in the conversion consideration under Section 10.07, and (iv) Spin-Offs to which the provis ions set forth below in this clause (c) shall apply, then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Rate under this clause (c) (other than an adjustment for a Spin-Off) in the event that (i) the Fair Market Value of the Distributed Assets applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the average Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day Period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, or (ii) such average Closing Sale Price exceeds such Fair Market Value by less than $1.00.  In such cases, in lieu of the adjustment under this clause (c), each Holder of Securities shall have the right to receive, at the same time as holders of the Common Stock and in addition to the cash and shares of Common Stock (if any) issuable upon conversion, for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities, the kind and amount of Distr ibuted Assets such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.
If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this clause (c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution (the ""), to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be appropriate.
Reference Period
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such dividend or other distribution consists of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to one or more of the Subsidiaries or other business units of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

the average of the Closing Sale Prices per share of the Common Stock over the Valuation Period.
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (c) in respect of a Spin-Off will occur on the last day of the Valuation Period; that in respect of any Securities converted during the Valuation Period, references with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the conversion date for such Securities in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.  
provided
To the extent that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
For purposes of this clause (c) and clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 10.05, any dividend or distribution to which this clause (c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (A) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this clause (c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (B) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by clauses (a) or (b) of this Section 10.05 with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribut ion shall be substituted for "the Ex-Date for such dividend or other distribution" within the meaning of clause (a) of this Section 10.05 and the "Ex-Date for such issuance" within the meaning of clause (b) of this Section 10.05 and any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution" within the meaning of clause (a) of this Section 10.05.
(d)
In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding Common Stock, other than (i) regular quarterly cash dividends (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) that do not exceed the Initial Dividend Threshold, and (ii) dividends or distributions made in connection with our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or upon a merger or consolidation, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

the amount in cash per share we distribute to holders of the Common Stock in excess of the Initial Dividend Threshold; that if the distribution is not a regular quarterly cash dividend (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), the Initial Dividend Threshold will be deemed to be zero.  
provided
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted by multiplying the Initial Dividend Threshold then in effect by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate prior to adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate following such adjustment.
An adjustment to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (d) will become effective on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.  To the extent that such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Rate under this clause (d) in the event that (i) the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, or (ii) such Closing Sale Price exceeds the amount of such distribution by less than $1.00.  In such cases, in lieu of the adjustment under this clause (d), each Holder of Securities shall have the right to receive, at the same time as holders of the Common Stock and in addition to the cash and shares of Common Stock (if any) issuable upon conversion, for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.
(e)
In case the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company makes, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, a
payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:

The adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (e) will become effective at the close of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Rate under this clause (e) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares of the Common Stock.
(f)
Except as stated herein, we will not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of the Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of
the Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.  If, however, the application of the foregoing formulas would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made (other than as a result of a share combination).
(g)
To the extent permitted by law, the Company may in its sole discretion make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by clauses (a) to (e) of this Section 10.05, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any United States federal income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.  
(h)
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased under this clause (h), the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the increase, which notice will be given at least 15 days prior to the effectiveness of any such increase, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.

No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such Conversion Rate; that any adjustments that by reason of this clause (i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Company shall take such carried-forward adjustments into account in any subsequent adjustment and make such carry forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% (A) on each day from and after the 25 Scheduled Trading Day prior to the maturity of the Securities, (B) in connection with a Fundamental Change, on each day from and including the 10 calendar day prior to the anticipated Effective Date of the Fundamental Change to the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, and (C) in connection with a Make Whole Event, from and including the 10 calendar day prior to the anticipated Effective Date of the Make Whole Event to the Make Whole Termination Date.

Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company will provide notice to Holders of such adjustment either (i) by written notice to Holders in the manner provided in , (ii) by electronic communication to Holders, or (iii) by issuing a press release through Business Wire containing the relevant information and making such information available on the Company's website or through another public medium as the Company may use at that time.  In addition, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Unless and until a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be de emed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has actual knowledge is still in effect.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Securities at its last address appearing on the Register, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.

(o)
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to Section 10.05 on account of a distribution on Common Stock, if the Holders of the Securities will otherwise participate for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities in such distribution without conversion as a result of holding the Securities at the same time and on the same terms as a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for:
(i)
the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan, or

The number of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be determined as set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 10.06, based on the Effective Date and the price (the "") paid per share for the Common Stock in such Make Whole Event.  If holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in such Make Whole Event, the "Stock Price" shall be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the "Stock Price" shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Make Whole Event.

Subject to clause (c) of this Section 10.06, the number of Additional Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Securities by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased for conversions of Securities in connection with a Make Whole
Event pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 10.06 will be as set forth in the following table, based on the Effective Date and the Stock Price for the Make Whole Event:
If the Stock Price or Effective Date for a Make Whole Event are not set forth in the table above, then:
(i)
if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates on the table, the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii)
if the Stock Price in excess of $180.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted under Section 10.05), the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be zero; or
(iii)
 if the Stock Price less than $71.64 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted under Section 10.05), the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be zero.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Conversion Rate, as increased by the number of Additional Shares determined pursuant to this clause (b), exceed 13.9587 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Securities, such number of shares being subject to adjustment in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted under Section 10.05; , that in no event will the number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate is increased (if any) on conversion of any KKR Securities under clause (c) of this Section 10.06 be so limited.

If the Stock Price or Effective Date for a Make Whole Event are not set forth in the table above, then:
(i)
if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates on the table, the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii)
if the Stock Price in excess of $180.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted under Section 10.05), the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be zero; or
(iii)
 if the Stock Price less than $10.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as and as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted under Section 10.05), the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock will be such number of Additional Shares that would have been issued based on the Effective Date had the Stock Price been $10 (as so adjusted).
(d)
The numbers of Additional Shares of Common Stock set forth in the tables in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 10.06 shall be adjusted, as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted, in the same manner in which the Conversion Rate is adjusted.  The Stock Prices set forth in the tables in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 10.06 shall be adjusted, as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted, to equal the Stock Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment,a fraction of which:

the numerator shall be the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment; and
(ii)
the denominator shall be the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.

Expenses
. After a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Shelf Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement may legally resume.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Additional Interest be payable in connection with a Registration Default relating to a failure to register the Common Stock into which the Notes are convertible; for the avoidance of doubt, if none of the Securities are registered then Additional Interest only will be payable in connection with the Registration Default relating to the failure to register the Notes. Upo n the cure of all Registration Defaults then continuing, the accrual of Additional Interest will automatically cease and the interest rate borne by the Notes will revert to the original interest rate at such time. Additional Interest shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in each six-month period between payment dates after the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline in which the Shelf Registration Statement is not effective or is unusable. Holders who have converted Notes into Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any Additional Interest with respect to such Common Stock or the principal amount of the Notes converted.

Nothing shall preclude a Holder of Registrable Securities from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or equitable relief with regard to this Agreement. Each obligation to pay Additional Interest shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default is cured.
A Registration Default under clause (a) above shall be cured on the date that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective. A Registration Default under clause (b) or (c) above shall be cured on the date an amended Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Company otherwise declares the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus useable, as applicable.
The parties agree that the Additional Interest provided for in this Section 2.4 constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by Holders of Registrable Securities and does not constitute a penalty.
. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company may suspend the use of any Prospectus, without incurring or accruing any obligation to pay Additional Interest pursuant to Section 2.4, for a period not to exceed an aggregate of 60 days in any 90-day period or an aggregate of 120 calendar days in any 360-day period, as such period may be reduced pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof (each, a "Suspension Period"), if the Company shall have determined in good faith that because of valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including without limitation plans for a registered public offering, an acquisition or other proposed or pending corporate developments and similar events or because of filings with the SEC, it is in the best interests of the Company to suspend such use , and prior to suspending such use the Company provides the Holders with written notice of such suspension, which notice need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to such suspension (and, upon receipt of such notice, each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder is advised in writing that the Prospectus may be used, which notice the Company agrees to provide promptly following the lapse of the event or circumstances giving rise to such suspension), that 60 days shall be increased to 75 days if the Company shall have determined in good faith that the disclosure of previously undisclosed proposed or pending material business transaction would be reasonably likely to impede its ability to consummate such transaction. Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension of the use of the Prospectus (including the fact of the suspension), except as requi red by applicable law.

(i)     use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement or the qualification of the securities therein for sale in any jurisdiction at the earliest practicable moment or, if any such order or suspension is made effective during any Suspension Period, at the earliest practicable moment after the Suspension Period;

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 4, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (1) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b)  above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party and (2) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b)  above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek i ndemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict will arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be material legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume suc h legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.

The indemnifying party under this Section 4 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 4(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

Settlements
(e)     If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the indemnifying parties on the one hand and the indemnified parties and the Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, (i) no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and (ii) no Initial Purchaser shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the purchaser discount or commission applicable to the Securities sold by such Initial Purchaser.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 4, each director, officer, employee and agent of Holder, or each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
(f)     The provisions of this Section 4 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any indemnified person referred to in this Section 4, and shall survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement.

Under any circumstances and for such periods as the Company would be permitted to initiate a Suspension Period pursuant to Section 2.5, the Company shall have the right to delay the commencement (e.g., the taking of any external activity, but not including internal, non-public preparatory work) of a Sponsor Supported Distribution (a "") for a period of days which, when aggregated with any pending or prior Suspension Periods and Delay Periods, would not exceed the 60 and 120-day limits set forth in Section 2.5 without, in the context of a registered Sponsor Supported Distribution, formally initiating a Suspension Period, provided that any such Delay Periods may not exceed and shall reduce (on a day-for-day basis) the 60 and 120-day limits referred to in Section 2.5 unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Holders participating in such registered Sponsor Supported Distribution, further that the Company shall be able to invoke such additional Suspension Periods as may required in order to comply with the Company's obligations under the Registration and Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2005, between Citigroup Inc. ("") and the Company (the ""). In the event that the Company invokes an additional Suspension Period as a result of a conflict between the request for a Sponsor Supported Distribution and the Company's obligations under the Citi Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will provide reasonable cooperation as is reasonably requested to permit a Supported Distribution to be commenced promptly after such conflict ceases to exist. In addition, under no circumstances shall the Company be required to commence a Sponsor Supported Distribution at any time during the three week period immediately preceding the scheduled public disclosure of results for any quarter (the "") and any delay during that time shall not be counted against the Suspension Period. If a request for a Sponsor Supported Distribution has been made before any Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period, however, the Company will provide reasonable cooperation as is reasonably requested during such Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period to permit such Sponsor Supported Distribution to be commenced promptly following the expiration of such Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any Sponsor Supported Distribution shall not require any pre-clearance under any stock trading policies of the Company in effect at such time.

EXHIBIT A
 
The undersigned beneficial owner (the "Selling Securityholder") of the 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") of Legg Mason, Inc. (the "Company") or the shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share, issuable upon conversion of the Notes (the "Common Stock" and, together with the Notes, the "Registrable Securities") hereby gives notice to the Company of its intention to sell or otherwise dispose of Registrable Securities beneficially owned by it and listed below in Item 3 (unless otherwise specified under Item 3) pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The undersigned, by signing and returning this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire, understands that it will be bound by the terms and conditions of this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2008, among the Company and the Purchasers thereto.
Selling security holders that do not complete this Questionnaire and deliver it to the Company as provided below will not be named selling security holders in the prospectus and therefore will not be permitted to sell any Registrable securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the undersigned has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company's directors, the Company's officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), from and against certain losses arising in connection with statements concerning the undersigned made in the Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus in reliance upon the information provided in this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire. The undersigned hereby acknowledges its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless certain persons set forth therein.
Certain legal consequences arise from being named a selling security holder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus. Accordingly, holders and beneficial holders are advised to consult their own securities law counsel regarding the consequences of being named or not named as a selling security holder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus.
The undersigned hereby provides the following information to the Company and represents and warrants that such information is accurate and complete:
The undersigned Selling Securityholder acknowledges that it understands its obligations to comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules thereunder relating to stock manipulation, particularly Regulation M thereunder (or any successor rules or regulations), in connection with any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Agreement. The undersigned agrees that neither it nor any person acting on its behalf will engage in any transaction in violation of such provisions.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify the Selling Securityholder against certain liabilities.
In the event the undersigned transfers all or any portion of the Registrable Securities listed in Item (3) above after the date on which such information is provided to the Company other than pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, the undersigned agrees to notify the transferee(s) at the time of the transfer of its rights and obligations under this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire and the Registration Rights Agreement.
In accordance with the undersigned's obligation under the Registration Rights Agreement to provide such information as may be required by law or by the staff of the Commission for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, the undersigned agrees to promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracies or changes in the information provided herein that may occur subsequent to the date hereof at anytime while the Shelf Registration Statement remains effective. All notices hereunder and pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement shall be made in writing, by hand-delivery, first-class mail, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery to the address set forth below.
By signing below, the undersigned consents to the disclosure of the information contained herein in its answers to Items (1) through (9) above and the inclusion of such information in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus. The undersigned understands that such information will be relied upon by the Company in connection with the preparation or amendment of the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus.
By signing below, the undersigned agrees that if the Company notifies the undersigned that Shelf Registration Statement is not available, the undersigned will suspend use of the prospectus until notice from the Company that the prospectus is again available.
Once this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire is executed by the undersigned and received by the Company, the terms of this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire, and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, shall be binding on, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, and assigns of the Company and the undersigned with respect to the Registrable Securities beneficially owned by the undersigned and listed in Item (3) above. This Selling Securityholder Questionnaire shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, by authority duly given, has caused this Selling Securityholder Questionnaire to be executed and delivered either in person or by its duly authorized agent.
