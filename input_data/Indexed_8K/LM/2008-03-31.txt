If , in any such restructuring or exchange offer, reorganization or other transaction, the Fund receives instruments that are Eligible Notes hereunder, such transaction shall not constitute a Contribution Event but the obligations of the Support Providers shall continue and shall apply to the instruments received.
(e) "Loss" incurred as a result of a Contribution Event means the excess of the Amortized Cost Value of the Eligible Notes subject to a Contribution Event over the amount received by the Fund in connection with such Contribution Event.

2. . The Fund agrees that:
Covenants of the Fund
(a) To the extent consistent with the Fund's interest, the Board shall consult with the Support Providers with respect to all decisions regarding each Eligible Note (including, but not limited to, any decision to sell the Eligible Note or to forgo the right to any payment) prior to the occurrence of a Contribution Event with respect to that Eligible Note. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to cause the delegation by the Board to any person any authority which is not permitted to be delegated under Rule 2a-7.
(b) The Fund will retain any Capital Contribution and not include the Capital Contribution in any dividend or other distribution to the Fund's shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subparagraph, the redemption of the Fund's shares shall not constitute a "distribution" to shareholders.
(c) Prior to the Fund taking any action or receiving any payment that would result in a Contribution Event under clauses 1(c)(i) or (ii) above, the Fund will provide the Support Providers with no less than one business day's notice that the Fund intends to take such action or expects to receive such payment, and will sell to either of the Support Providers, if either elects to purchase, all of the Eligible Notes that are the subject of the intended action at a price equal to the greater of (i) the Amortized Cost Value of such Eligible Notes and (ii) the market value of such Eligible Notes. The Fund will also sell to either of the Support Providers at any time within five business days before the date on which the Fund is required to sell Eligible Notes under clause (d) below, if either elects to purchase, all Eligible Notes that are outstanding and held by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of (i) the Amortized Cost Value of such Eligible Notes and (ii) the market value of such Eligible No tes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2(c), each Support Provider hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Fund is required pursuant to the terms of the Related CSA to sell the Eligible Notes to the Related Support Providers in the same manner and under the same circumstances as is provided for in this Section 2(c) and as a result there may be insufficient Eligible Notes available to honor all purchase elections in their entirety under all Related Agreements. In that circumstance, (1) Legg Mason agrees that it shall only make purchase requests under one Related Agreement and the parties hereto agree that to the extent Legg Mason makes a purchase request, it shall be entitled to purchase all the Eligible Notes it has requested to purchase, and LMCS4 agrees that to the extent Legg Mason has elected to purchase all the Eligible Notes, the Fund's obligations to LMCS4 under this Section 2(c) have been satisfied; and (2) to the extent Legg Mason has elected to purchase less than all of the Eligible Notes but after giving effect to any purchase request by Legg Mason there still exists insufficient Eligible Notes to satisfy the purchase request being made by LMCS4 and any other Related Subsidiary Support Provider (the amount of Eligible Notes remaining available to be purchased being the "Available Notes"), the Fund shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations hereunder so long as the amount of Eligible Notes LMCS4 has requested to purchase hereunder is only reduced by an amount which permits LMCS4 to purchase at least fifty percent (50%) of the Available Notes and the Fund takes similar action under the Related CSA as it relates to the obligation to sell to the other Related Subsidiary Support Provider.
(d) The Fund will promptly sell the Eligible Notes, to the extent they otherwise continue to be held by the Fund, on the business day immediately prior to the date set forth in subparagraph 3(c)(iii).
(e) The Related CSA shall remain in full force and effect so long as this Agreement is in effect (including, without limitation, the requirement of the Related Subsidiary Support Provider to maintain the Related Segregated Account so long as a similar requirement as to LMCS4 exists hereunder) and to the extent a Contribution Event occurs, the Capital Contribution shall be funded fifty percent (50%) by the Support Providers hereunder and fifty percent (50%) by the Related Support Providers under the Related CSA (including, without limitation, by a deduction from amounts in the Related Segregated Account in accordance with the terms of the Related CSA).
3. .
Contributions to Fund
(a) If a Contribution Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Support Provider will make a Capital Contribution in an amount equal to the lower of (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Loss incurred as a result of such Contribution Event, or (ii) the Maximum Contribution Amount reduced by the amount of any Capital Contribution previously made by either Support Provider to the Fund under this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Related CSA provides for a Capital Contribution to be made by the Related Support Providers under the Related CSA in an identical amount.
(b) The Support Providers shall make the Capital Contribution to the Fund not later than one business day after the occurrence of a Contribution Event, by 12:00 noon, Eastern Time. Each Capital Contribution made hereunder shall be made in immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the Fund.
(c) The obligation of the Support Providers to make Capital Contributions pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (such occurrence, the "Termination Event"): (i) the Support Providers have made Capital Contributions equal to the Maximum Contribution Amount, (ii) the Fund no longer holds Eligible Notes, or (iii) 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 31, 2009. If an event constitutes both a Termination Event and a Contribution Event, then the Termination Event will not be deemed to have occurred until the Support Providers have made any Capital Contributions required under this Agreement with respect to such Contribution Event.
(d) The obligations of the Support Providers to make Capital Contributions hereunder shall be joint and several. Any required Capital Contribution hereunder may be made by either Support Provider, in the sole discretion of the Support Providers.
(e) If the Support Providers make a Capital Contribution when due, then the amount that LMCS4 is obligated to maintain in the Segregated Account shall be reduced to give effect to such Capital Contribution. In the event that the Support Providers do not make a Capital Contribution when due, the Fund will draw funds from the Segregated Account by 4:00 p.m. on the day that such Capital Contribution was required to have been made and in an amount equal to the Capital Contribution that is due. Any amount withdrawn from the Segregated Account shall be deemed to be a Capital Contribution made hereunder by the Support Providers.

Baltimore, Maryland -- March 31, 2008 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) announced that the Company has entered into capital support agreements (CSAs) to provide support to a money market fund managed by a subsidiary of the Company. Neither the fund, nor its shareholders incurred a loss in this transaction. Legg Mason also provided today an update regarding the anticipated earnings impact of these actions for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 as well as an update to accruals related to previously announced money market fund support.
"Legg Mason is putting the CSAs in place to provide support at a time when certain segments of the marketplace continue to experience asset price fluctuations," said Mark R. Fetting, the Company's president and chief executive officer. "We are confident in the overall soundness of the Company's money market funds and remain committed to providing our fund shareholders with principal stability, credit quality, and current income, although no guarantees can be given.
"Legg Mason has the financial strength to work through the issues caused by the current conditions in the credit markets. We are encouraged by the improved tone in the credit markets after the Fed's substantial actions to restore liquidity to the financial system. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may take additional action if we deem it appropriate," concluded Mr. Fetting.
Under the CSAs, the Company capital contributions to the fund if the fund realizes a loss on the sale of or certain other events relating to two asset backed commercial paper securities in the portfolio. The Company will make up to a maximum of $400 million of contributions to the fund under the CSAs and has fully collateralized this obligation. The CSAs will terminate in one year. The Company is filing a Form 8-K with further details of this transaction.

Impact on Quarterly Earnings
Reflecting the entry into the CSAs announced today, the Company has incurred an estimated $316 million non-cash charge in the quarter ended March 31, 2008 to its earnings ($195 million net of taxes, or $1.38 per diluted share) reflecting the fair value of the underlying securities as of March 28, 2008.
Based on current market conditions and prices, Legg Mason has accrued an estimated non-cash charge to earnings of approximately $498 million, ($279 million net of adjustments to incentive compensation and taxes, or $1.96 per diluted share), in the quarter ended March 31, 2008 principally representing unrealized losses in the securities underlying its cumulative support to date. This charge consists of the combined impact of the action announced today together with incremental, non-cash, mark-to-market charges attributable to previously announced money market fund support, including securities purchased from money market funds.
