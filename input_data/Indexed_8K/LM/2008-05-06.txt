Baltimore, Maryland May 6, 2008  Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported its operating results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.  For the quarter, revenues were $1.07 billion, down 6% from $1.14 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  The Company reported a net loss of $255.5 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to net income of $172.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
The fourth quarter net loss resulted from two non-cash charges: 1) previously announced support for money market funds, totaling $291.0 million after tax and compensation related adjustments, or $2.06 per diluted share; 2) a charge of $94.8 million after tax, or $0.66 per diluted share, for a reduction in the value of acquired management contracts held by a Wealth Management subsidiary since the time of its acquisition by Legg Mason. Cash income, as adjusted, for these non-cash charges (please refer to page 5), was $178.5 million for the quarter, or $1.25 per diluted share, down 20% and 19%, respectively, from cash income, as adjusted, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
For the full fiscal year 2008, the Company achieved record revenues of $4.63 billion, up 7% from $4.34 billion in fiscal 2007. Net income for fiscal 2008 was $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, representing a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from fiscal 2007 results. Cash income, as adjusted, for the year was $877.0 million, or $6.09 per diluted share, both representing an increase of 4% from fiscal 2007.
Assets Under Management ("AUM") at the end of fiscal 2008 were $950.1 billion, down 5% from $998.5 billion at December 31, 2007, and down 2% from $968.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2007.
Comments on the Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Results
Mark R. Fetting, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "This past quarter was among the most difficult we have ever faced and we are disappointed with our results. We remain a fundamentally strong firm today, but we know we have work to do.  We are fully focused on restoring our historically strong investment performance across the board, despite the challenges of continued market volatility and investor uncertainty.
"In the quarter just ended, we continued to provide, on a proactive basis, financial support to several of our money market funds. The non-cash charges from this support led to a net loss for the quarter. We also incurred a non-cash charge for a write-down of certain acquired management contracts. Our actions on behalf of the money market funds have been dilutive to our earnings for two consecutive quarters, but we are resolute in our view that these have been prudent and proper actions to take. We will stay vigilant going forward.
"Excluding these two non-cash charges, cash income, as adjusted, was $178.5 million for the fourth quarter. Our overall earnings power remains strong and our annual revenues of $4.63 billion in fiscal 2008 represented a record for Legg Mason. The diversification and global scale of our managers are key elements of our competitive advantage as a firm. We have major managers who are performing very well in a tough investment climate, and we are seeing growth outside the U.S., but we know that we need our U.S. equity managers to return to form, and this is a top priority."
Assets Under Management Decreased to $950 Billion
AUM decreased to $950.1 billion as of March 31, 2008, down $48.4 billion, or 5%, from $998.5 billion at December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of market depreciation of $28.5 billion in the fourth quarterand net client cash outflows of $19.2 billion. Equity outflows were $17 billion and fixed income outflows were $7 billion for the quarter, while liquidity inflows totaled $5 billion.
Average AUM during the quarter were $975 billion, compared to $1,014 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and $959 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  At March 31, 2008, equity products represented 29% of AUM, fixed income represented 53% and liquidity represented 18%. By business division, 54% of total AUM were in Institutional, 40% in Managed Investments and 6% in Wealth Management. Assets managed for non-U.S. domiciled clients represented 34% of total AUM at March 31, 2008.  
For the fiscal year 2008, total AUM declined by $18.4 billion, or 2%, from $968.5 billion at March 31, 2007. Despite the challenging markets, Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine each grew their AUM in fiscal 2008.
Comparison to the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007
Revenues decreased 6% from the prior year quarter, reflecting lower investment advisory fees as a result of the decline in performance fees and year-over-year changes in the mix of equity and fixed income assets. Operating expenses increased by 7% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the $151 million write-down of certain acquired management contracts. Other non-operating expenses were $530.5 million, driven by approximately $517.2 million of losses and other costs related to the Company's money market fund support. For the
quarter, the Company incurred a net loss of $255.5 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, down from net income of $172.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  The diluted loss per share included a net charge of $2.06 for the support of the money market funds and a net charge of $0.66 for the write-down of certain acquired management contracts. Cash income (please refer to page 5) was a loss of $207.3 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to cash income of $222.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Cash income, as adjusted, was $178.5 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, compared to $222.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the comparable period last fiscal year.
The pre-tax profit margin decreased to (36.7%) from 24.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  The pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 30.1% (please refer to page 6), down from 33.3% in the prior fiscal year quarter.
Results for Fiscal Year 2008
Total revenues for fiscal 2008 were $4.63 billion, up 7% from the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by an increase in fund advisory fees of 15%. Performance fees decreased for the year by 7%, to $132.7 million.  Net income was $267.6 million, down 59% from $646.8 million in fiscal 2007. Earnings were $1.86 per diluted share, a decrease of 58% from $4.48 in fiscal 2007.  Cash income for the year was $468.5 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, compared to cash income of $846.0 million, or $5.86 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.  Cash income, as adjusted, was $877.0 million, or $6.09 per diluted share, both up 4% from $846.0 million, or $5.86 per diluted share, for the corresponding previous fiscal year.
The pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2008 was 9.6%, compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2007. The pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 32.8%, down slightly from 33.2% in fiscal 2007.
Comparison to the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2008
Revenues of $1.07 billion decreased 10% from $1.19 billion in the prior quarter ended December 31, 2007.  There was a loss of $255.5 million in the quarter, compared to net income of $154.6 million in the prior quarter. The decline in net income was largely the result of the non-cash charges to support money market funds and the write-down of certain acquired management contracts. Cash income was a loss of $207.3 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to cash income of $205.1 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.  Cash income, as adjusted, of $178.5 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, represented a decrease of 22% and 21%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
The pre-tax profit margin was (36.7%) compared to 20.8% in the prior quarter. The pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 30.1%, down from 33.0% in the prior quarter.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Cash Income and Cash Income, as Adjusted
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") for "cash income" and "cash income, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We define "cash income" as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets.  We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus net money market fund support losses and impairment charges.
We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to prior period results and to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions or money market fund support transactions.  We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cashincome, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP.  Legg Mason c onsiders cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value, and because they facilitate comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with prior period results and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions or money market fund support transactions.
In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions.  Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income.  In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add net money market fund support losses and net impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating res ults to prior period results and the results of other asset management firms.   
Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite-life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure appropriate explanations accompany such disclosures.  The impairment
charge on amortizable management contracts recognized in the March 31, 2008 quarter impacts both cash income and cash income, as adjusted, because any decrease in value is already reflected in reduced revenues.  Further, like other amortizable intangibles, no adjustment for deferred taxes has been previously reflected in cash income.
Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are presented on pages 12-13.
Pre-Tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, As Adjusted for Distribution and Servicing Expense, Money Market Fund Support Losses and Impairment Charges
is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus it shows the effect of these items on our margins. Further, money market fund support losses and impairment charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's pre-tax profit margin to prior period profit margins and the profit margins of other asset management firms that hav e not engaged in significant acquisitions or money market fund support transactions. This measure is provided in addition to the Company's pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. Reconciliations of consolidated pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted, to pre-tax profit margin under GAAP, are presented on pages 14-15.
Legg Mason believes that pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense, money market
fund support losses (net of related compensation adjustments) and impairment charges
, money market fund support losses and impairment charges that we do not consider part of our core business metrics
