The Equity Units were offered and sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 6, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters").  The Underwriters have a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 Equity Units, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and is initially comprised of (i) a purchase contract which will obligate the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 30, 2011, a certain number of shares of the Company's common stock, $0.10 par value, for $50; and (ii) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.60% senior notes due June 30, 2021 (the "Notes").  Holders of the Equity Units will be entitled to receive quarterly contract adjustment payments of a rate of 1.40% per year of the stated amount of $50 per unit.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of May 12, 2008 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee.  The Company filed the Base Indenture on May 6, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as Exhibit 4(a) to the Company's Form S-3.
 
The purchase contracts are being issued pursuant to a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, The Bank of New York, in its capacity as the purchase contract agent, and The Bank of New York, in its capacity as the collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary.  Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Notes are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligation to purchase the shares of common stock under the purchase contracts.  The Notes will be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions, prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and a remarketing agreement to be entered into among the Company, The Bank of New York, as purchase contract agent, and a reset agent and remarketing agent to be designated by the Company.

9.
            
(a)
          
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided, however
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
 
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  No indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the indemnifying party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be
 
sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnifying party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnifying party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnifying party.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
 
Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.
          
(a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, the Representatives may arrange for the Representatives or another party or other parties, subject to the approval of the Company in its sole discretion, to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within twenty-four hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of twenty-four hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives  opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based
 
on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.
          
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.
          
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof or as a result of the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13.
          
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any Underwriter on behalf of the Representatives as the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile
 
transmission to the Representatives as the Representatives at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., General Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Attention: General Counsel, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated at 4 World Financial Center, New York, New York 10080, Attention: Global Origination Counsel Group; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided, however
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
 
14.
          
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.
          
Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16.
          
The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory
 
services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17.
          
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.
          
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.
          
The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.
          
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Company and each of the Representatives plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company.  It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on you part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

Re: 
Legg Mason, Inc. - Lock-Up Agreement
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:

The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Undersigned's Shares even if such Shares would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned.  Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of the Undersigned's Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such Shares.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions contained in this letter shall not apply to (i) transfers of shares of Common Stock or options to purchase the Common Stock made as a gift or gifts, provided that (A) the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, or (B) such gift is a charitable donation to a tax exempt organization in an amount of 5% or less of the Common Stock owned at the date hereof by the undersigned, (ii) transfers of shares of Common Stock or options to purchase the Common Stock made to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, (iii) transfers or sales of shares of Common Stock for the payment of exercise costs (including taxes) in respect of any purchase of Common Stock pursuant to stock options granted pursuant to existing employee benefit plans or director compensation plans of the company, (iv) sales under 10b-5(1) plans established prior to the date hereof or (v) sales of up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate by Messrs.

The Remarketing Agent may deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of Proceeds therefrom in excess of sum of the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price.  With respect to Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, any Proceeds of the Remarketing attributable to such Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes in excess of the sum of the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units.

With respect to Separate Notes upon a Successful Early Remarketing, any Proceeds of the Remarketing attributable to such Separate Notes in excess of the Remarketing Fee with respect to the Separate Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of such Separate Notes on the Reset Effective Date.  None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, or any Holders of Corporate Units or Holders of Separate Notes whose Notes or Separate Notes are so remarketed shall otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith.

If, despite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and the Separate Notes, if any, during such Three-Business Day Remarketing Period (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100% of the sum of the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Note Purchase Price or a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement is not fulfilled, the Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "").

Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.08 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent.  If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.

Section 5.04(a) Each Fixed Settlement Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, as follows:
.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments. 
 
In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make any other distribution of Common Stock on the outstanding shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which:
(i)
           
dividing
 
the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for such determination the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, and
(A)
          
plus
 
the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for such determination;
(B)
           
 
such increase to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date for such determination.
For the purposes of this clause (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The Company agrees that it shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plans or share purchase plans, to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of announcement of such issuance, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date of such announcement shall be increased by such Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which:
(ii)
          
dividing
 
the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for such determination the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, and
(A)
          
plus
 
the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for such determination the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price;
(B)
           
plus
 
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of such announcement.  The Company agrees that it shall notify the Purchase Contract Agent if any issuance of such rights, warrants or options is cancelled or not completed following the announcement thereof and each Fixed Settlement Rate shall thereupon be readjusted to the Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of such announcement.  For purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The Company agrees that it shall not issue any such rights, warrants or options in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and,
(iii)
         
conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased, such increase or decrease, as the case may be, to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the Business Day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
 
In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, case or property (excluding (A) any dividend  or distribution covered by clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 5.04(a), (B) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and (C) any Spin-Off as to which an adjustment was effected under the provisions of clause (v) of this Section 5.04(a), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by such rate by a fraction of which:
(iv)
         
dividing
 
the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date for such determination, and
(A)
          
 
the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date for such determination the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock;
(B)
           
less
 
such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution.  In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, make a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a "") that are, or when issued will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which
(v)
          
Spin-Off
 
the numerator shall be the of (x) the average of the closing prices of such capital stock or similar equity interests distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over
(A)
          
sum
the 10 consecutive Trading Day period (the "") commencing on and including the third Trading Day after the date on which "ex-distribution trading" commences for such distribution on the NYSE or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such dividend or distribution is listed or quoted and (y) the average of the Closing Prices of one share of Common Stock over the Relevant Period, and
Relevant Period
 
the denominator shall be the average of the Closing Prices of one share of Common Stock over the Relevant Period.
(B)
           
 
In case the Company shall make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company) in an amount per share of Common Stock that exceeds $0.24 per quarter (such per share amount, the ""), then, in such case, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by such rate by a fraction of which:
(vi)
         
Reference Dividend
dividing
 
the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such record date, and
(A)
          
 
the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such record date the amount of cash per share of Common Stock so distributed (and not excluded as provided above) in excess of the Reference Dividend;
(B)
           
less
 
such increase to be effective at the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date; ,, that in the event the portion of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Units the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Unit on the record date.  The Reference Dividend shall be subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever each Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted under this clause (vi).  In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
provided
however
 
The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve:
(vii)
        
a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the record date for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (iv) of this Section); and
(A)
          
 
a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (iii) of this Section).
(B)
           
 
In case the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall make a tender or exchange offer (other than any odd-lot tender offer) for all or any portion of the Common Stock and upon expiration of such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof), to the extent that the cash and the value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) exceeds the average closing price of the Common Stock for each of the five consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made under such tender or exchange offer (the ""), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the Expiration Time shall be adjusted by such rate by a fraction of which:

Expiration Time
dividing
 
the numerator shall be equal to the of (1) the fair market value, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors (whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution), of the aggregate consideration payable for all shares of Common Stock that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, purchased in such tender or exchange offer (the "") and (2) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time, any Purchased Shares, and (y) the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and
(A)
          
sum
Purchased Shares
less
 
the denominator shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Expiration Time, including the Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time;
(B)
           
such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of the Expiration Time.
 
All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).  No adjustment in the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent thereof; , that (i) any adjustments which by reason of this subclause are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment and (ii) that effect shall be given to all anti-dilution adjustments no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the first Trading Day in the 20 consecutive Trading Day period during which the Applicable Market Value is determined (or, if earlier, the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate is determined).
(ix)
          
provided, however
 
If any adjustment is made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.04(a), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Reference Price and Threshold Appreciation Price.  In addition, if any adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by this Section 5.04(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, the 20 individual Closing Prices used to determine the Applicable Market Value shall be appropriately adjusted to account for the adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution).
(x)
           
 
The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Fixed Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.04(a), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.  The Company may make such a discretionary adjustment only if it makes the same proportionate adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate.
(xi)
          
 
If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in
(xii)
         
Rights
 
which case each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.04(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.
 
(b)      Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event.
 
(i)    In the event of Reorganization Event that causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive other securities, cash or property, each Purchase Contract then outstanding would, without the consent of the Holders of the underlying Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, become a contract to purchase such other securities instead of the Common Stock. If such Reorganization Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), each Purchase Contract then outstanding would become a contract to purchase the amount of other securities, cash and/or property corresponding to the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such election. Upon the occurrence of any such transaction, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Settlement Rate will be determined based on the securities, cash or property a holder of Common Stock would have received when such transaction occurred.
 
(ii)   If a Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, then each Holder of a Unit shall have the right, to accelerate and settle ("") the Purchase Contract contained in such Unit upon the conditions set forth below at the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate; that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its best efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement. In the event that a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such Fundamental Change Early Settlement but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's election shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement becomes effective.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
provided
 
If a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Fundamental
Change Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments including and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
 
The "" shall be determined by reference to the table set forth below, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the stock price (the "") in the Fundamental Change, which means: (A) in the case of a Fundamental Change described in clause (ii) of the definition of such term and holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in the Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share; or (B) otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the five Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate
Effective Date
Stock Price
 
The following table sets forth the Stock Price and Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate per $50 of Stated Amount of Units:
 
 
The exact Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
 
(A)      if the Stock Price on the Effective Date is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amount and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
 
(B)      if the actual Stock Price on the Effective Date exceeds $119.90 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth
herein, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be the Minimum Settlement Rate; and
 
(C)      if the actual Stock Price on the Effective Date is less than $51.50 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate will be the Maximum Settlement Rate.
 
The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table above shall be adjusted as of any date on which any Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the applicable Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Fixed Settlement Rate as so adjusted. The number of shares of Common Stock set forth in the table above will be adjusted in the same manner as the Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof.
 
Within 15 Business Days of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such Fundamental Change, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii), the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least 10 days after the date of such written notice by the Company, but which shall in no event be later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (the ""), the applicable Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder, including the amount of Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments receivable, upon settlement.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date
 
Corporate Units Holders and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Unit Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii) in multiples of 10,000 Corporate Units or such other number of Corporate Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent following a Successful Remarketing of the Notes if the Reset Effective Date is not an Interest Payment Date. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01 shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(ii).
 
In order to exercise the Fundamental Change Early Settlement right with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units
shall deliver, no later than the close of business on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of "Election to Settle Early" on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the sum of:
 
(i)            product of (A) the Stated Amount and (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement,
less
 
(ii)           the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments.
 
Upon receipt of such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
 
Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount and (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
 
If a Holder properly effects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(ii), the Company shall deliver (or shall cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
 
(A)      the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to
such Fundamental Change at the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Rate in addition to accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments to the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date. For purposes of the foregoing, where a Fundamental Change involves a transaction that causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) and the Holder exercises a Fundamental Early Change Settlement, the Company shall deliver to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Fundamental Change shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date;
 
(B)      the Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities underlying the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units, as the case may be; and
 
(C)      if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.04(b)(ii).
 
(c)       All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto.
 
(d)      The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with Section 5.04(b) shall continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
(e)       Neither Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted under this Section 5.04 upon the occurrence of any of the following:
 
(i)    the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future Plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional option amounts in shares of Common Stock upon any Plan;
 
(ii)   upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit Plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
(iii)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of May 12, 2008;
 
(iv)  for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
 
(v)   for accumulated and unpaid dividends.
 
Section 5.05(a) Whenever the Fixed Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.04 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware):
. Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events.
 
(i)    compute each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.04 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth each Fixed Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
 
(ii)   provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate.
 
(b)           The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 5.

Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes, the Treasury Securities or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming part of such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.15 hereof. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.
 
Section 5.07(a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.07, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early ("") at any time prior to the close of business on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.07 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use best efforts to (i) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (ii) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Early Settlement (it being understood that if there is a material business transaction or development with respect to the Company that has not yet been publicly disclosed, the Company shall not be required to provide such Prospectus and the Early Settlement right shall not be available until the Company has publicly disclosed such transaction or development; that the Company shall use its best efforts to make such disclosure as soon as it is commercially reasonable to do so). In the event that a Holder of a Purchase Contract seeks to exercise its Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is so required but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such Registration Statement becomes effective. Unless a Successful Remarketing of the Notes or a Special Event Redemption has previously occurred, Holders of Corporate Units shall not be permitted to effect Early Settlement (i) during a Restricted Period or (ii) following the effectiveness of a Fundamental Change in which case the provisions of Section 5.04(b)(ii) shall apply.

Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action, subject to payment of any amounts then due and payable to it hereunder, to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor.  The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder.  After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article 15 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary.  Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is also acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be.
 
(b)
       
Because The Bank of New York is serving as the Collateral Agent hereunder and also as the Purchase Contract Agent hereunder, if an event of default or collateral event of default occurs hereunder The Bank of New York will resign as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary, but continue to act as the Purchase Contract Agent.  A successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary will be appointed in accordance with the terms of this Article 15.
 
Section 15.11The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith.

Section 15.13Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them and regardless of the form of action.
.  Exculpation. 
 
Section 15.14The Company agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary for:
.  Expenses, Etc. 
 
(a)
       
all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary), in connection with (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery or performance of this Agreement and (ii) any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement;

(FORM OF REVERSE OF CORPORATE UNIT CERTIFICATE)
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ""), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Collateral Agent, as Custodial Agent, as Securities Intermediary, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units from time to time, to which Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred.
 
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.08 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby that is settled through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Fundamental Change Early Settlement).
 
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, unless a Termination Event shall have occurred, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or a Remarketing of the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to the close of business on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the sixth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (2) on or prior to the close of business on the seventh Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price, less the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder, for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the
Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes held by the Collateral Agent in the Remarketing unless the Holder has previously made a Fundamental Change Early Settlement. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Notes as a component of Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio.
 
As provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, unless such Holder has elected Cash Settlement and delivered Cash in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Notes underlying such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and to have the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price, less any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall terminate without the necessity of any notice or action by the Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Senior Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Corporate Units Holders the notice required by the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of such Notes and shall deposit the funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for such Notes. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Special Event Treasury Portfolio.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Successful Remarketing of the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes during the Period for Early Remarketing, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will apply an amount equal to the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio.
 
Following the occurrence of (i) a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (ii) a Successful Remarketing of the Notes on or prior to the ninth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio as the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and the underlying Notes as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
 
The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for a Note underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Corporate Units shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Units in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be and Purchase Contract constituting such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit.
 
Subject to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Treasury Securities secure the Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "."  A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units.
Treasury Unit
 
If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, but only in
integral multiples of 10,000 Corporate Units or such other number of Corporate Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent following a Successful Remarketing of the Notes if the Reset Effective Date is not an Interest Payment Date.
 
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract underlying such Corporate Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
 
Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
 
The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the
Pledge of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, any payments with respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes (other than interest payments thereon) or the Proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of each of the definitions of Applicable Ownership Interest in the Special Event Treasury Portfolio and Applicable Ownership Interest in the Remarketing Treasury Portfolio), as the case may be, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date less any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
 
The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of law provisions thereof to the extent that the application of a law of a different jurisdiction would govern as a result.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Corporate Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest payable on the Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
 
A copy of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Purchase Contract Agent.

This Treasury Units Certificate certifies that Cede & Co. is the registered Holder of the number of Treasury Units set forth above [For inclusion in Global Certificates only - or such other number of Treasury Units reflected in the Schedule of Increases or Decreases in Global Certificate attached hereto], which number shall not exceed 20,000,000.

Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as defined on the reverse hereof).
Pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Treasury Securities constituting part of each Treasury Unit evidenced hereby have been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising part of such Treasury Unit.
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company, to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a Purchase Price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock, of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless prior to or on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to such Purchase Contract, all as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION OF PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT
 
This is one of the Treasury Units referred to in the within-mentioned Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
 
 
 
(REVERSE OF TREASURY UNIT CERTIFICATE)
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ""), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Collateral Agent, as Custodial Agent, as Securities Intermediary, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units from time to time, to which Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred.
 
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.08 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby that is settled through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Fundamental Change Early Settlement).
 
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of this Treasury Unit shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of the Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby either by effecting an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of each such Purchase Contract or by applying the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Holder's Treasury Unit equal to the Purchase Price for such Purchase Contract to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Treasury Units who (1) on or prior to the close of business on the seventh Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, or (2) on or prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Cash Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price, less the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder, for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price, less any Deferred Contract Payments for the shares of
Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
The Purchase Contract and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying each Treasury Unit. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Treasury Security underlying such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
 
The Treasury Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute a Note or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract constituting such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit.
 
Subject to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes, or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, secure the Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Corporate Unit."  A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in multiples of 20 Treasury Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes as a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder of Treasury Units may substitute Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities only in multiples of 10,000 Treasury Units or such other number of Treasury Units as may be determined by the Remarketing Agent upon a Successful Remarketing of the Notes if the Reset Effective Date is not an Interest Payment Date.
 
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract underlying such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
 
Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
 
The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (, affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities underlying this Treasury Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date less any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
i.e.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of law provisions thereof to the extent that the application of a law of a different jurisdiction would govern as a result.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration or transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
 
A copy of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Purchase Contract Agent.
