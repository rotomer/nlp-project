WHEREAS, the Fund holds notes and other instruments (the "Notes") issued by structured investment vehicles listed in Schedule A attached hereto (each, an "Issuer");
WHEREAS, Rule 2a-7(c)(6)(ii) requires a money market fund to "dispose of [a portfolio] security as soon as practicable consistent with achieving an orderly disposition of the security, . . . , absent a finding by the board of directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the best interests of the money market fund (which determination may take into account, among other factors, market conditions that could affect the orderly disposition of the portfolio security)" upon the occurrence of certain events;
WHEREAS, one or more of the events specified in Rule 2a-7(c)(6)(ii) have occurred with respect to the Notes;
WHEREAS, a sale of the Notes under current market conditions is unlikely to result in the full recovery of the Fund's investments, and may cause the Fund to realize losses;

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the Fund (the "Board") will consider this Agreement in determining whether disposal of the Notes currently would be in the best interest of the Fund:

1. . In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in the Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Definitions
(a)"Amortized Cost Value" means, with respect to any Eligible Note held by the Fund, the value of that Eligible Note as determined using the Amortized Cost Method in accordance with Rule 2a-7 on the relevant date. Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of the Loss under this Agreement, if an Eligible Note is received in an exchange or restructuring, the Amortized Cost Value of such Eligible Note shall be increased by the excess, if any, of the Amortized Cost Value of the predecessor Note as of the time immediately preceding the exchange over the sum of the Amortized Cost Value of the Eligible Note and any cash received in such exchange.
(b) "Capital Contribution" means a cash contribution by either Support Provider to the Fund for which the Support Provider does not receive any shares or other consideration from the Fund.

(ii) receipt of final payment on the Eligible Note in an amount less than the Amortized Cost Value of that Eligible Note as of the date such payment is received;
(iii) issuance of orders by a court having jurisdiction over the matter discharging the Issuer from liability for the Eligible Note and providing for payments on that Eligible Note in an amount less than the Amortized Cost Value of that Eligible Note as of the date such payment is received; and
(iv) receipt of new securities that are "Eligible Securities," as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 2a-7, in exchange for or replacement of Eligible Notes if the Amortized Cost Value of such new securities is less than the Amortized Cost Value of such Eligible Notes on the date of exchange or replacement.
(d) "Eligible Notes" mean the Notes held by the Fund as portfolio securities on the date hereof or any securities or other instruments received in exchange for, or as a replacement of, the Notes or any Eligible Notes as a result of an exchange offer, debt restructuring, reorganization or similar transaction pursuant to which the Notes or Eligible Notes are exchanged for, or replaced with, new securities of the Issuer or a third party, other than Notes or securities which are or become "Eligible Securities" as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 2a-7.

2. . The Fund agrees that:
Covenants of the Fund
(a) To the extent consistent with the Fund's interest, the Board shall consult with the Support Providers with respect to all decisions regarding each Eligible Note (including, but not limited to, any decision to sell the Eligible Note or to forgo the right to any payment) prior to the occurrence of a Contribution Event with respect to that Eligible Note.

(b) The Fund will retain any Capital Contribution and not include the Capital Contribution in any dividend or other distribution to the Fund's shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subparagraph, the redemption of the Fund's shares shall not constitute a "distribution" to shareholders.
(c) Prior to the Fund taking any action or receiving any payment that would result in a Contribution Event under clauses 1(c)(i) or (ii) above, the Fund will provide the Support Providers with no less than one business day's notice that the Fund intends to take such action or expects to receive such payment, and will sell to either of the Support Providers, if either elects to purchase (with such election to be in the form of a written notice delivered to the Fund by such Support Provider in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 6(d) within one business day of the aforesaid notice by the

provided, however
(e) If the Support Providers make a Capital Contribution when due, then the amount that LMSub is obligated to maintain in the Segregated Account shall be reduced to give effect to such Capital Contribution.

Exhibit 99.1
Baltimore, Maryland -- June 30, 2008 - Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) announced that the Company has entered into capital support agreements (CSAs) to support three money market funds managed by a subsidiary of the Company. Neither the funds nor their shareholders incurred a loss in these transactions. Legg Mason also provided today an update regarding the anticipated earnings impact of these actions for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, as well as an update to accruals for the quarter related to previous money market fund support.
Under the CSAs, the Company will make up to an aggregate of $240 million in capital contributions to the funds if any of the funds realize a loss on the sale of or certain other events relating to certain Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) securities in the portfolios. The Company has fully collateralized each obligation. The CSAs will terminate in nine to twelve months. The Company is filing a Form 8-K with further details of these transactions.
"Legg Mason is putting the CSAs in place to support the same securities we have previously supported in other funds. The support provides the funds with flexibility to work through difficult markets as we seek to reduce the exposure in the funds," said Mark R. Fetting, the Company's president and chief executive officer. "We are confident in the overall soundness of the Company's money market funds and remain committed to providing our fund shareholders with principal stability, credit quality, and current income, although no guarantees can be given."
"Legg Mason raised capital during the first six months of 2008 in part to provide the Company with additional financial strength to work through potential issues caused by continued uncertainty in the credit markets. While there was improvement in the markets during the months of April and May, there has been an adverse market environment for most asset-backed securities in June. Today's action, which extends our support to every stable value fund that has exposure to SIVs, is part of our continued monitoring of credit market conditions and we may take additional action if we deem it appropriate," concluded Mr. Fetting.
Impact on Quarterly Earnings
Reflecting the entry into the CSAs announced today, the Company expects to incur an estimated $146 million non-cash charge in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 to its earnings ($90.1 million net of taxes, or $0.64 per diluted share. )
Based on current market conditions and prices, Legg Mason expects to accrue an estimated non-cash charge to earnings of approximately $265.3 million, ($154.5 million net of adjustments to operating expenses and taxes, or $1.09 per diluted share), in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 principally representing unrealized losses in the securities underlying its cumulative support to date, including the actions announced today. This charge consists of the combined impact of the action announced today together with incremental, mark-to-market charges attributable to previous money market fund support, including securities purchased from money market funds.
