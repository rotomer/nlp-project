Baltimore, Maryland  October 29, 2008  Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM) today reported its operating results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, which ended September 30, 2008.  For the quarter, revenues were $966 million, down 18% from $1.17 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.  The Company reported a net loss of $103.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $177.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and compared to a net loss of $31.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
The second quarter net loss resulted primarily from charges arising from support for money market funds (after tax and operating expense adjustments) totaling $191.1 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, reflecting the extreme dislocation in the liquidity marketsMarket conditions also resulted in pre-tax non-operating losses of $38.6 million, including mark-to-market charges of $23 million on deferred compensation investments, which is largely offset in compensation and benefits expenses, and $19 million on investment seed capital.
.  
Cash income, as adjusted for the charges resulting from money market fund support (please refer to page 4), was $137.2 million for the quarter, or $0.97 per diluted share, down 41% and 39%, respectively, from cash income, as adjusted, of $231.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Assets Under Management ("AUM") were $841.9 billion, down 9% from $922.8 billion at June 30, 2008, principally reflecting market declines, as well as net client outflows and exchange rate impact from the strengthening dollar. AUM were down 17% from $1.012 trillion at September 30, 2007.
  
Comments on the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2009
Mark R. Fetting, President and Chief Executive Officer, said "While this has been a challenging quarter for all financial services companies, including Legg Mason, I have never been more convinced that we have the right model and strategy to take this company to the next level.
"As evidence of this, our AUM decrease for the quarter was less than many of our competitors, with fully 75% due to market depreciation.  Excluding our support for SIVs, we were solidly profitable for the quarter.  In spite of significant market turmoil, our total outflows were similar to the level in the June quarter.  Unlike several of our competitors, our liquidity funds had net inflows for the quarter.  We believe that this is due in large measure to the confidence earned by our ongoing support of our shareholders through these tough times.
"We continued to support our money market fund shareholders through our financial support of SIVs held in our funds.  It is important to note, however, that the funds' exposure to SIVs declined from 2.4% to 1.8% of our total liquidity assets during the quarter. We have thoroughly analyzed these positions down to the individual security level during the quarter.  As the credit markets begin to ease, as a result of various actions in the market, we now believe we have a number of options to ultimately resolve these issues as appropriate.  We are pursuing them with vigor.
"I am most excited, however, because we now have our complete executive leadership team in place, following the appointments this quarter of Joseph A. Sullivan as Chief Administrative Officer and David R. Odenath as Head of the Americas.  They join Peter L. Bain, Head of Strategy and Affiliate Management, Charles J. Daley Jr., Chief Financial Officer, and Ronald R. Dewhurst, Head of International Asset Management. I now have a highly seasoned team that will move the Company forward on a global basis.
"As a team we are not satisfied with where we are.  Over the quarter we have worked very hard to sharpen our strategy to become the pre-eminent global asset manager.  We believe that the three pillars to support that outcome are: 1) superior investment performance over the long term; 2) world-class distribution capability here and abroad; 3) appropriate level of corporate services to achieve these goals in as efficient a manner as possible.
"While we are not satisfied with where we are, we have solid plans in place to drive our three strategies forward. Immediately, we have identified significant cost savings that will be implemented between now and fiscal year end that will make us leaner and meaner.  As we have stated, our model, unlike others, automatically provides for reduced costs in periods of lower revenue. But that is just the beginning. We will not rest until we achieve all of our stated objectives."
Assets Under Management Decreased to $842 Billion
AUM decreased to $841.9 billion at September 30, 2008, down $80.9 billion, or 9%, from $922.8 billion at June 30, 2008, and down $169.7 billion, or 17%, from September 30, 2007. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, net client cash outflows were $20.0 billion. Equity outflows were approximately $9 billion and fixed income outflows were approximately $12 billion, while liquidity inflows were approximately $1 billion in the quarter.

Comparison to the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2008
Revenues decreased 18% from the prior year quarter, reflecting a decline in fees earned on lower average assets under management and lower performance fees. Operating expenses decreased by 17% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits, as well as
lower distribution and servicing costs, driven by lower levels of AUM. Other non-operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $380.0 million, including $324.6 million of losses related to the Company's money market fund support; there were no comparable losses in the prior year quarter.

The net loss of $103.8 million in the quarter, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $31.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in net charges on money market fund support.

Business Developments
The Company continued to focus on business opportunities in global markets during the quarter:
To serve its growing base of clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Brandywine Global established a new operating unit based in London, England. Over 40% of assets managed by Brandywine are for non-U.S. domiciled clients.
In order to take advantage of the distressed-investor selling among certain hedge funds affected by the global financial crisis, Permal announced the launch of Permal Hedge Fund Opportunities, a new offering which will make discounted secondary market investments into existing hedge funds, as distressed investors liquidate their positions.
The Company also finalized the Legg Mason Global Equities Group, with the inclusion of the London-based affiliate Exemplia Emerging Markets and the Singapore-based affiliate Congruix Investment Management. Exemplia and Congruix were previously units of Legg Mason International Equities. Exemplia and Congruix join Global Currents, along with Legg Mason Australian Equities and Legg Mason managers based in Hong Kong, Brazil and Poland, as members of the Global Equities Group, representing approximately $18 billion in combined AUM. The Group consists of specialty firms, dedicated to the global equities asset class, that each pursue their own unique investment strategies but collectively benefit from the global scale of Legg Mason to expand their reach and to access new client opportunities.
Also, Legg Mason Investment Counsel (LMIC), our trust and advisory business, was ranked for the first time as one of the Top 30 Wealth Managers in Barron's annual survey. LMIC also opened two new offices in the Eastern U.S. to serve its growing clientele of high net worth investors looking for world-class asset management as well as the personalized service of the family office.
Balance Sheet
At September 30, 2008, Legg Mason's cash position, including cash equivalents and cash restricted for collateral purposes, was $3.1 billion, total debt was $3.5 billion and stockholders' equity was $6.4 billion.  The ratio of total debt to total capital (total equity plus total debt) was 35%.
Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Cash Income (Loss) and Cash Income, as Adjusted
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") for "cash
income" and "cash income, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We define "cash income" as net income (loss) plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets.  We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus net money market fund support losses and impairment charges.
We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions.
We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cashincome, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP.  Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value, and because they facilitate comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transac tions or significant acquisitions.
In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions.  Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income.  In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add net money market fund support losses and net impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these non-recurring charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions.   
Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite-life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure appropriate explanations accompany such disclosures.
Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to non-GAAP cash income (loss) and cash income, as adjusted, is presented on page 11.
Pre-Tax Profit Margin, As Adjusted for Distribution and Servicing Expense, Money Market Fund Support Losses and Impairment Charges
is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus it shows the effects of these items on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Company's pre-tax profit margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. A reconci liation of consolidated pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, to pre-tax profit margin under GAAP, is presented on page 13.

fund support losses and impairment charges
, money market fund support losses and impairment charges that we do not consider part of our core business metrics
