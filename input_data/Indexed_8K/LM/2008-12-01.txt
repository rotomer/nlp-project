4. Final Price Determination
Following the termination of any Transaction in whole or in part pursuant to Clause 3 or by reason of the occurrence of the Scheduled Termination Date (other than in connection with a Repayment), the Final Price for the relevant Terminated Obligation will be determined in accordance with this Clause 4.
Determination by Counterparty
(a) In order to determine the Final Price for any Terminated Obligation then held by the Hedge Party as a hedge for the related Transaction, Counterparty may arrange for the sale of such Terminated Obligation by giving notice of such sale to Barclays. Such notice must be given at least three Business Days prior to the related Pricing Date in the case of any Terminated Obligation and at least 30 days prior to the Scheduled Termination Date if all Transactions are to be terminated in connection with the Scheduled Termination Date. , (ii) must be scheduled to occur on or prior to the related Pricing Date in the case of any Terminated Obligation and prior to the Scheduled Termination Date if all Transactions are to be terminated in connectio n with the Scheduled Termination Date and (iii) must be settled substantially in accordance with the then-current market practice in the principal market for the related Reference Obligation, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If Counterparty so arranges any sale, the net cash proceeds received from the sale of any Terminated Obligation, net of the related Costs of Assignment, shall be the "" for that Terminated Obligation.
Any sale (i) must be to a buyer approved in advance by Barclays (which may be Barclays or any Affiliate thereof), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
Final Price
Determination by Calculation Agent
(b) If the Final Price for any Terminated Obligation is not determined according to Clause 4(a), the Calculation Agent shall attempt to obtain Firm Bids for such Terminated Obligation with respect to the applicable Pricing Date from three or more Dealers. The Calculation Agent will give Counterparty notice
of its intention to obtain Firm Bids pursuant to this Clause 4(b) (such notice to be given telephonically and via electronic mail) not later than one hour prior to the bid submission deadline specified below. By notice to Barclays not later than 30 minutes after such notice from the Calculation Agent, Counterparty may, but shall not be obligated to, designate a Dealer of credit standing acceptable to Barclays in the exercise of its reasonable discretion to provide a Firm Bid (and the Calculation Agent will seek a Firm Bid from such Dealer if so designated by Counterparty on a timely basis). A "" shall be a good and irrevocable bid for value, to purchase all or a portion of the applicable Terminated Obligation, expressed as a percentage of the Reference Amount and exclusive of accrued interest and without regard to any Commercial Paper Discount (but inclusive of any principal representing capitalized or deferred interest), for settlement substantially in a ccordance with the then-current market practice in the principal market for such Terminated Obligation, as determined by the Calculation Agent, submitted by a Dealer as of 9:00 a.m. New York time on the Pricing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter. Barclays may, but is not obligated to, sell or cause the sale of any portion of any Terminated Obligation to any Dealer that provides a Firm Bid.
Firm Bid
If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain from Dealers at least one Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids for all of the Reference Amount of any Terminated Obligation on the relevant Pricing Date, the Calculation Agent will attempt to obtain a Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids for all of the Reference Amount of such Terminated Obligation from three or more Dealers within one Business Day after the relevant Pricing Date.
If the Calculation Agent is able to obtain at least one Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids for all of the Reference Amount of any Terminated Obligation within one Business Day after the relevant Pricing Date, the Final Price for such Terminated Obligation shall be determined by reference to such Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids. If no Firm Bids are obtained for all or a portion of the applicable Terminated Obligation within one Business Day after the relevant Pricing Date, the Final Price shall be deemed to be zero with respect to each portion of such Terminated Obligation for which no Firm Bid was obtained. The Calculation Agent will conduct the bid process in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Clause 4(b) and otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner. With respect to any termination of a Transaction effected under Clause 3(a), Barclays and Counterparty will make commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the assignment to Counterparty of any Termin ated Obligation (or portion thereof) for which the Final Price is deemed to be zero (including as provided below);that Barclays shall not be liable for any losses related to any delay in or failure of such assignment beyond its control.
provided
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
(i) the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to disregard any Firm Bid submitted by a Dealer if, in the Calculation Agent's commercially reasonable judgment, (x) such Dealer may be ineligible to accept assignment or transfer of the related Terminated Obligation or portion thereof, as applicable, substantially in accordance with the then-current market practice in the principal market for the Reference Obligation, as determined by the Calculation Agent, or (y) such Dealer would not, through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, be able to obtain any consent required under any agreement or instrument governing or otherwise relating to the related Reference Obligation or to the assignment or transfer of the related Terminated Obligation or portion thereof, as applicable, to it; and
(ii) if the Calculation Agent determines that the highest Firm Bid obtained in connection with any Pricing Date is not , including, without limitation, due to (x) the insolvency of the bidder, (y) the inability, failure or refusal of the bidder to settle the purchase of the related Terminated Obligation or portion thereof, as applicable, or otherwise settle transactions in the relevant market or perform its obligations generally or (z) the Calculation Agent having other reasonable grounds for insecurity concerning the bidder's ability to settle the purchase of the related Terminated Obligation or portion thereof, as applicable, that Firm Bid shall be disregarded.
bona fide
If Barclays transfers, or causes the transfer of, the Terminated Obligation to the Dealer or Dealers providing the highest Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids, the net cash proceeds received from the sale of such Terminated Obligation, which sale shall be settled substantially in accordance with the then-current market
practice in the principal market for the related Reference Obligation as determined by the Calculation Agent, net of the related Costs of Assignment, shall be the "" for that Terminated Obligation.
Final Price
If Barclays determines, in its sole discretion, not to sell or cause the sale of any portion of any Terminated Obligation to the entity or entities providing the highest Firm Bid or combination of Firm Bids, the "" for such unsold portion shall be equal to such highest Firm Bid (or combination of Firm Bids) multiplied by the Reference Amount of such Terminated Obligation (or the respective portions of the Reference Amount to which such Firm Bids relate). The Calculation Agent may perform any of its duties under this Clause 4(b) through any Affiliate designated by it, but no such designation shall relieve the Calculation Agent of its duties under this Clause 4(b).
Final Price
Early Termination of Facility
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Termination Date occurs prior to the day preceding the Scheduled Termination Date, each Counterparty Second Floating Amount shall continue to be payable by Counterparty on each subsequent Second Floating Rate Payer Payment Date occurring on or prior to the day preceding the Scheduled Termination Date; that, if either party shall so specify in writing to the other party prior to any final Pricing Date, then on the Termination Date (i) the obligation of Counterparty to continue to pay each Counterparty Second Floating Amount on each subsequent Second Floating Rate Payer Payment Date shall terminate and be replaced by the obligation in the following clause and (ii) Counterparty shall pay to Barclays an amount equal to the present value (as calculated by the Calculation Agent with discounting on each Counterparty Second Floating Rate Payer Payment Date on an Actual/360 basis) discounted to the Terminati on Date of each Counterparty Second Floating Amount payable (without regard to the termination of such obligation under the foregoing clause) on each subsequent Second Floating Rate Payer Payment Date, at a discount rate per annum equal to the Discount Rate. For this purpose, the "" means the zero coupon swap rate (as determined by the Calculation Agent) implied by the fixed rate offered to be paid by Barclays under a fixed for floating interest rate swap transaction with a remaining Term equal to the period from the Termination Date to the Scheduled Termination Date in exchange for the receipt of payments indexed to USD-LIBOR-BBA.

Following any Repayment Date, Barclays shall prepare and deliver to Counterparty a revised Trade Register Annex showing the revised Reference Amount for the related Reference Obligation; that any such change in the Reference Amount shall be effective whether or not Barclays prepares and delivers a revised Trade Register Annex.
provided

If any Reference Obligation or portion thereof is irreversibly converted or exchanged into or for any securities, obligations, cash or other assets or property (""), thereafter such Exchange Consideration will constitute such Reference Obligation or portion thereof and the Calculation Agent shall in good faith adjust the terms of any Transaction relating to such Reference Obligation as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to preserve the theoretical value of such Transaction to the parties immediately prior to such exchange or, if such exchange results in a change in value, the proportionate post-exchange value, and determine the effective date of such adjustments.

(b) With respect to each Transaction to which this Confirmation relates, the "Independent Amount Percentage" applicable to such Transaction will be equal to:
Provided that the Independent Amount Percentage with respect to the Specified Transaction shall be 20%.

In addition, for purposes of calculating "Exposure" with respect to any Transaction to which this Confirmation relates, (i) Barclays shall be the sole Valuation Agent and shall determine any Market Quotation in relation to such Transaction, (ii) such Market Quotation will be determined by the Valuation Agent using its estimate of the amount that would be paid for a Replacement Transaction based on the application of Section 6(e)(i)(3) of the Master Agreement, (iii) such Market Quotation may from time to time be determined by the Valuation Agent in its sole discretion and without notice to Counterparty solely in respect of payments in respect of Capital Appreciation or Capital Depreciation that would have been required in respect of a Transaction after the relevant Early Termination Date (provided that the Valuation Agent will not thereafter be precluded from making such determination with respect to all payments and deliveries that would have been required after the relevant Early Termination Date, regardless of the absence of notice thereof to Counterparty), (iv) if Counterparty disputes the calculation of Exposure with respect to such Transaction, the Valuation Agent will recalculate Exposure for such Transaction on the basis that the market value of the related Reference Obligation is equal to its Current Price and (v) on and after any satisfaction of the Extension Condition, "Exposure" with respect to the Specified Transaction shall not be less than USD50,000,000.

If Counterparty enters into any Transaction under (and as defined in) the Master Agreement other than the Transactions contemplated by this Confirmation (each, a ""), then the Delivery Amount and Return Amount with respect to Counterparty as Pledgor and all Separate Transactions shall be calculated (i) solely with reference to all Separate Transactions and (ii) without regard to the aggregate of all Independent Amounts applicable to the Pledgor under this Confirmation or any Posted Collateral Transferred by Pledgor pursuant to this Confirmation.
Separate Transaction
(g) Except as provided in the following sentence, on the Business Day next succeeding the Pricing Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be, with respect to a Terminated Obligation or Repaid Obligation, (i) the Independent Amount Percentage with respect to the Transaction (or portion thereof) related to such Terminated Obligation or Repaid Obligation shall be reduced to zero and (ii) neither party shall have any right to demand the transfer pursuant to the Credit Support Annex of additional Eligible Credit Support or the return of Posted Credit Support based upon any subsequent change in Exposure to the other party with respect to the Transaction (or portion thereof) related to such Terminated Obligation or Repaid Obligation. If the Final Price with respect to any Transaction (or portion thereof) relating to a Terminated Obligation is determined by reference to one or more Firm Bids submitted by Counterparty or any Affiliate thereof, then
(i) the Independent Amount Percentage with respect to the Transaction (or portion thereof) related to such Terminated Obligation shall not be reduced to zero until the date of the final settlement of all purchases as to which Counterparty or any Affiliate thereof has submitted a Firm Bid satisfying the requirements of Clause 4(b) and (ii) Barclays (in its sole discretion) may continue to demand the transfer pursuant to the Credit Support Annex of additional Eligible Credit Support (subject to Counterparty's right to demand the return of Posted Credit Support) based upon changes in Exposure subsequent to the submission of such Firm Bids by Counterparty or any Affiliate thereof, in each case, until the date of the final settlement of all purchases as to which Counterparty or any Affiliate thereof has submitted a Firm Bid satisfying the requirements of Clause 4(b) (and, for this purpose, such Credit Support Amount shall be determined with respect to any T erminated Obligation as if no Final Price had been established until the date of settlement of the relevant purchase).

(iv) receipt of new securities that are "Eligible Securities," as
defined in paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 2a-7, in exchange for or replacement of Eligible Notes if the Amortized Cost Value of such new securities is less than the Amortized Cost Value of such Eligible Notes on the date of exchange or replacement.

(b) The Fund will retain any Capital Contribution and not include the Capital Contribution in any dividend or other distribution to the Fund's shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subparagraph, the redemption of the Fund's shares shall not constitute a "distribution" to shareholders.

Baltimore, MD  December 1, 2008  Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE:LM) today announced additional support for four money market funds with exposure to securities issued by Structured Investment Vehicles and other similar conduits (SIVs).  Legg Mason also announced that it had renewed for one year a total return swap with a major banking institution in support of $355 million of SIV securities.   In addition, to provide flexibility during a time of prolonged market turmoil, Legg Mason has obtained amendments to its existing debt covenants.
The Company also announced it has already identified in excess of $100 million in sustainable cost reductions from its corporate operating budget and is on track to realize an aggregate $120 million annually, effective on a run rate basis at March 31, 2009.
Mark R. Fetting, the company's chief executive officer, commented: "Legg Mason continues to manage its resources and to take proactive steps in support of our money market funds during difficult market conditions.   Today's actions give us financial and operating flexibility to handle potential further market deterioration.   We are actively pursuing a number of options to eliminate exposure to SIVs in the money market funds.    Additionally, we have moved aggressively to restructure our organization and improve our cost profile to reflect current realities.   We have the ability and the resolve to work through these challenging markets as we act in support of our clients, our funds and our shareholders."   
Legg Mason put in additional support for certain SIV securities in four funds by increasing by $420 million the maximum capital contribution obligation of the Company under existing Capital Support Agreements ("CSAs") and, in one case, providing an additional CSA to a fund.  The Company has fully collateralized these additional obligations.   Neither the funds nor their shareholders incurred a loss in these transactions.  As of November 30, 2008, the par value of SIV exposure in the funds was $2.8 billion, down from $10 billion as of October 31, 2007.      
The Company also announced that it had renewed a total return swap with a major banking institution that supports $355 million in SIV securities that were transferred to
the bank in 2007.  The securities covered by the swap decreased from $890 million in December 2007, as certain principal payments were received throughout the year.  The renewed agreement expires on November 24, 2009. The company has provided $209 million in total to collateralize the swap.
The Company's amended debt covenants change the maximum permissible leverage ratio of total debt to EBITDA from 2.5 to 3.0 to provide increased flexibility.  The debt covenants were also amended to change the definition of EBITDA used in the financial covenants to increase the exclusion of any SIV-related cash charges to $2.75 billion from $750 million, as the Company seeks options to reduce its SIV exposures.   The changes affect $500 million in an outstanding revolving credit facility and $550 million in an outstanding term loan.
The Company also confirmed that it is on track to achieve a total reduction of $120 million, or 20%, in its annual corporate operating budget on a run rate basis by the end of the current fiscal year. These reductions do not include additional expense reductions already taken and continuing within Legg Mason investment affiliates.
