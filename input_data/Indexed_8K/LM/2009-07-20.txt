Comments on the First Fiscal Quarter 2010 Results
Mark R. Fetting, Chairman and CEO, said, "While we recognize that there is still more to do, we are pleased to return Legg Mason to profitability. Legg Mason generated strong cash income, significantly reduced operating expenses, and reported sequential increases in assets under management at most of our affiliate companies, driven by debt and equity market appreciation and a reduction in outflows. Over the past year, the management team has been and will continue to be sharply focused on implementing key strategic initiatives designed to increase our financial strength and flexibility to best position us for improved performance and growth.  We took advantage of conditions in the marketplace to increase our equity capital and reduce our debt and related interest expense with the exchange offer we announced last week.  We will continue to manage our business with discipline on costs and resources.  While we are encouraged by the improved markets, it is important to distinguish stimulus from fundamentals in assessing the overall economic recovery."    
 "We are always looking at efficiencies within our business and will continue to emphasize improving our investment performance and generating growth, which we believe are the most significant drivers of value for our shareholders.  Initiatives underway include bringing innovative product solutions to our client base, rounding out our investment capabilities and expanding our distribution relationships," concluded Mr. Fetting.
Assets Under Management Increased to $657 Billion
AUM increased 4% to $656.9 billion compared with $632.4 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 primarily driven by market appreciation of 9%, offset in part by reduced client outflows.  AUM decreased 29% from $922.8 billion in the first fiscal quarter of 2009.
Fixed income outflows were $22 billion, equity outflows were $6 billion, and liquidity outflows were $2 billion.  
At June 30, 2009, fixed income represented 56% of AUM, while equity and liquidity each represented 22% of AUM.  
By business division, 70% of AUM was in the Americas Division and 30% of AUM was in the International Division.  
Average AUM during the quarter was $647.2 billion compared to $657.4 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and $948.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Comparison to the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2009
Net income was $50.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share as compared with a net loss of $330.2 million, or $2.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter as last quarter's results included the losses related to the elimination of exposure to Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) in our money funds, intangible asset impairment charges and real estate lease losses, offset in part by one-time tax benefits.
Revenues of $613.1 million were slightly lower than the $617.2 million in the prior quarter ended March 31, 2009, reflecting a 2% decline in average AUM partially offset by higher performance fees in the current quarter.  
Operating expenses of $554.8 million decreased by 16% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This was primarily due to charges taken in the prior quarter, including intangible asset impairment and real estate lease losses which totaled $121.1 million.  Absent the impairment and real estate loss charges, severance costs and the mark-to-market impact on compensation, expenses were down 4%, reflecting the continued impact of cost savings measures.
Other income (expense) was $22.4 million and included $46.4 million of investment gains, of which $31.4 million related to gains on funded deferred compensation plan and seed capital investments that are offset in compensation and benefits. The remaining $15 million of gains principally related to market gains on corporate seed investments that are not offset in

compensation and benefits. Fund support gains of $17.6 million reflect the recovery of charges taken in prior quarters on $35 million of support for non-SIV related securities in offshore money funds that was put in place in fiscal 2009. Other income (expense) in the March 2009 quarter was a loss of $646.1 million, primarily reflecting losses on elimination of SIV support in our money fund business.
Cash income, as adjusted, was $86.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to a cash loss, as adjusted, of $741.5 million or $5.23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, as last quarter's results included realized losses from eliminating exposure to SIVs.    
Pre-tax profit margin increased to 13.2% from a loss in the fourth quarter.  Pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 18.3%, also up from a loss in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Comparison to the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2009
Net income was $50.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share, up from a net loss of $36.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as the prior year's first quarter results included money market fund support charges.
Revenues of $613.1 million decreased 42% from the prior year quarter, driven by a decline in fees earned due to lower average assets under management and changes in the mix of our AUM to lower average fee assets.
Operating expenses decreased by 33% from the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to lower distribution and servicing fees on a lower asset base, decreased variable compensation, and cost saving measures that resulted in decreases in compensation, communications and technology, occupancy and other operating expenses.
As previously discussed, other income (expense) in the first quarter was $22.4 million and included gains associated with funded deferred compensation plans, seed capital investments and fund support. Other income (expense) in the June 2008 quarter was a loss of $286.8 million, primarily reflecting losses on SIV support in our money fund business.
Cash income, as adjusted, of $86.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $166.5 million for the first fiscal quarter 2009, or $1.17 per diluted share.
Pre-tax profit margin increased to 13.2% from a loss in the first fiscal quarter of 2009.  The pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 18.3%, up from a loss in the prior year quarter.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Cash Income (Loss) and Cash Income (Loss), as Adjusted
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") for "cash income" and "cash income, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We define "cash income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.  We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus (less) net money market fund support losses (gains) and impairment chargesless net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities.
We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, issued contingent convertible debt or done significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments.
We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cashincome, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP.  Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value, and because they facilitate comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions.
In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions.  Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income.  Conversely, we subtract the income tax benefits on these impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. We also include imputed interest, which is a non-cash expense, on contingent convertible debt required by FSP APB 14-1 as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP.  In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add (subtract) net money market fund support losses (gains) less net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.  
Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite-life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions
 
  Exhibit 99
News Release
are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.
Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to non-GAAP cash income (loss) and cash income (loss), as adjusted, is presented below.
Pre-Tax Profit Margin as Adjusted for Distribution and Servicing Expense
Legg Mason believes that pre-tax profit margin adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Company's pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies.  A reconciliation of pre-tax profit margin adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is presented below.
