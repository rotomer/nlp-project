Comments on the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2010 Results
Mark R. Fetting, Chairman and CEO, said, "In our second quarter, Legg Mason generated another quarter of improving cash income, as adjusted, continued to operate its business efficiently and further strengthened its balance sheet.  This quarter, operating income has significantly increased over last quarter, driven by higher assets under management.  Our excess cash position of $1.1 billion  combined with our significant cash tax benefits  puts us in a position to further reduce debt and to reinvest in our businesses.  We continue to strive for improvements in our investment performance, to enhance our investment capabilities and to provide innovative solutions to our clients, all of which are significant drivers of value for our shareholders.
As of the end of September, approximately 81% of Legg Mason's U.S. long-term funds were beating their respective Lipper category averages over the 10-year period, and most of our affiliates are delivering significant improvements in their performance over the one-year period and, increasingly, over longer periods as well. In both our Americas and International centralized distribution channels, stronger gross sales and moderating outflows have contributed to our improving net flows.  If these trends continue, Legg Mason will be positioned to return to positive net flows."     
Assets Under Management Increased to $703 Billion
AUM increased 7% to $702.7 billion as compared with $656.9 billion at June 30, 2009 driven by market appreciation partially offset by reduced outflows. AUM decreased 17% from $841.9 billion at September 30, 2008.
Fixed income outflows were approximately $10 billion, equity outflows were $2 billion, and liquidity inflows were $4 billion.  Total outflows of $8 billion reflected a 73% improvement from the prior quarter's $30 billion.
At September 30, 2009, fixed income represented 55% of AUM, equity 24% and liquidity 21%.  
AUM for U.S. domiciled clients was 64% of total AUM and 36% for non-US clients.  By business division, 69% of AUM was in the Americas Division and 31% of AUM was in the International Division.
Average AUM during the quarter was $684.0 billion as compared to $647.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $898.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Comparison to the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2010
Net income was $45.8 million or $0.30 per diluted share as compared to $50.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the first quarter.
Revenues of $659.9 million were up 8% from $613.1 million in the prior quarter ended June 30, 2009.  This reflects an increase in AUM as well as an increase in the percentage of higher yielding equity assets and higher performance fees.
Operating expenses of $582.0 million increased 5% from $554.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation on higher revenues, and $3.5 million in additional occupancy expenses related to the move of the company's headquarters in September.  
, were 21% as compared to 20% in the first fiscal quarter.
Operating margins were 12% as compared to 10% in first quarter of fiscal 2010.  Operating margins, as adjusted

Other income (expense) was ($2.9) million, as compared to $22.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  Gains on funded deferred compensation plan and seed capital investments that are offset in compensation and benefits were $24.1 million in the quarter as compared to $31.4 million in the

first quarter. Second quarter results included $22 million in transaction costs from the exchange of 91% of our equity units in August, partially offset by a $14.8 million reduction in interest expense from the exchange.  In addition, gains from fund support declined from $17.6 million in the June quarter to $5.6 million this quarter.
Cash income, as adjusted, was $90.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, as compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $86.8 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the first quarter.

Comparison to the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2009
Net income was $45.8 million or $0.30 per diluted share, up from a net loss of $108.7 million or ($0.77) per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as the prior year's second quarter results included significant money market fund support charges.
Revenues of $659.9 decreased 32% from the prior year quarter, driven by a decline in fees earned due to lower average assets under management and changes in the mix of our AUM to lower average fee assets.
Operating expenses decreased by 22% from the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to lower distribution and servicing fees on a lower asset base, decreased variable compensation, and cost saving measures that resulted in decreases in compensation, communications and technology and other operating expenses.
Operating margins were 12% as compared to 23% in the prior year quarter.  Operating margins, as adjusted, were 21% as compared with 29% for the prior year quarter.
As previously discussed, other income (expense) in the second quarter was ($2.9) million as compared to ($388.1) million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to $324.6 million in money market fund support charges in the prior period.
Cash income, as adjusted, of $90.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, as compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $140.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, or $0.99 per diluted share.
Pre-tax profit margin increased to 11.4% from a loss in the second fiscal quarter of 2009.  The pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted, was 15.4%, as compared to a loss in the prior year quarter.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
As supplemental information, we are providing the following performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries:
Cash income
Cash income, as adjusted
Operating margin, as adjusted
Pre-tax profit margin, as adjusted
Cash Income (Loss) and Cash Income (Loss), as Adjusted
We define "cash income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.  We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus (less) net money market fund support losses (gains) and impairment chargesless net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities.
We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, issued contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments.
We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cashincome, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP.  Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value, and because they facilitate comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions.
In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions.  Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income.  Conversely, we subtract the income tax benefits on these impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. We also include imputed interest, which is a non-cash expense, on contingent convertible debt required by new accounting standard s as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP.  In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add (subtract) net money market fund support losses (gains) less net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.  
 
  Exhibit 99
News Release
Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite-life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.
Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
Operating Margin, as Adjusted
We  calculate "operating margin, as adjusted," by dividing (i) operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans and the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements by (ii) our operating revenues less distribution and servicing expenses that are passed through to third-party distributors, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues".  The compensation items are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non-operating income, and thus have no impact on Net Income.  We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products.  Legg Mason believes that operating margin, as adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what Legg Mason's operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products.  This measure is provided in addition to the Company's operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies.
Pre-tax Profit Margin, as Adjusted
We calculate "pre-tax margin, as adjusted," by dividing income (loss) from operations before income tax provision by adjusted operating revenues. Legg Mason believes that pre-tax profit margin adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what Legg Mason's pre-tax profit margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our pre-tax profit margin. This measure is provided in addition to the pre-tax profit margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies.
