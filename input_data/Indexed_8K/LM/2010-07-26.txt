Comments on First Fiscal Quarter 2011 Results
Mark R. Fetting, Chairman and CEO, said, "We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth.  We are pleased to announce our first quarter of equity inflows in over four years, including the largest closed-end fund capital raise in the industry since 2007.  In fixed income, we are hard at work on the longer term process of turning flows to positive following sustained improved investment performance.  We believe that Western Asset's improved performance is a testament to both the strength of their investment process and the enhancements they made in integrating their risk management efforts with that process.  Over the short term, market volatility has led to swings in equity performance, but our affiliates are positioning well for improvement in client results.  Our overall 3- and 5-year performance numbers show improvement over the past y ear, and we are working in partnership with our affiliates to create investment vehicles that will bring clients back into the market and help them rebuild wealth.
"We are making progress on our plans to transfer certain support functions to our affiliates and we are on track to meet our targets. Even as we streamline our business model, we continue to look at growth opportunities, and our affiliates continue to add talent, including an experienced professional to service sovereign wealth clients at Permal. We are actively evaluating the addition of investment capabilities.  With regard to use of capital, we have entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement and remain fully committed to additional ways to drive shareholder value," concluded Mr. Fetting.  
Assets Under Management Decreased to $645 Billion
AUM decreased to $645.4 billion at June 30, 2010 from $684.5 billion driven by net outflows of $23.1 billion and market declines of $16.0 billion. Long-term asset net outflows of $8.7 billion continue to trend favorably.  
Fixed income outflows were $9.4 billion and liquidity outflows were $14.4 billion for the quarter ended June 30. Equity inflows of $0.7 billion mark the first quarter of equity inflows in over four years.  
th
At June 30, 2010, fixed income represented 56% of AUM, while equity represented 24% and liquidity represented 20% of AUM.

Net income was $47.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, as compared with $63.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Revenues of $674.2 million were up from $671.4 million in the prior quarter, due to higher realization rates which more than offset a 2% decline in average AUM.  Performance fees of $22.8 million were in line with the prior quarter due to fees earned at Western Asset Management, Brandywine Global and Permal.
Operating expenses of $571.4 million increased 1% from $565.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 due to $17.6 million of expenses related to the launch of the closed-end fund this quarter.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") for "adjusted income", "consolidated statements of income, excluding consolidated investment vehicles", and "operating margin, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
Adjusted Income
Adjusted Income was formerly reported as "Cash Income, as Adjusted." We define "adjusted income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment.  We also adjust for non-core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as impairment charges on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill, including the related impact on deferred income taxes, and net money market fund support losses (gains).
We believe that adjusted income provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments, or engaged in money market fund support transactions.  We also believe that adjusted income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.  
Adjusted income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net income determined under GAAP.  This measure is provided in addition to net income, but is not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, adjusted income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP.  Legg Mason considers adjusted income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, issued contingent convertible debt, or enga ged in money market fund support transactions.
In calculating adjusted income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions.  Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of adjusted income.  Conversely, we subtract the income tax benefits on impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP.  We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non-cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP.  We also add (subtract) non-core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities, if applicable) and impairment charges to net income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. 
Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite-life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on adjusted income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.
 
  Exhibit 99
News Release
Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating adjusted income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles
Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of the new financial accounting standard on consolidations, Legg Mason now consolidates and separately identifies certain sponsored investment vehicles, primarily comprised of a collateralized loan obligation entity.  
In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles", we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of
investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non-operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment vehicles.  We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying performance and economics of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but do not own.  By deconsolidating the consolidated investment vehicles from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by Legg Mason from consolidated investment vehicles are added back to reflect our actual revenues.  Similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non-operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of consolidated vehicles are removed from the GAAP basis Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to Le gg Mason.  The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented.  The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non-GAAP basis of other companies.
Operating Margin, as Adjusted  
We  calculate "operating margin, as adjusted," by dividing (i) operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition-related costs of streamlining our business model, primarily termination benefits, income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues".  The compensation items, other than transition-related costs, are removed from operating income in the calculation be cause they are offset by an equal amount in Other non-operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income.  Transition-related costs and income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles are removed from operating income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations.  We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period.  Adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from consolidated investment vehicles that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.  Legg Mason believes that operating margin, as adjusted , is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what Legg Mason's operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition-related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above.  The consolidation of these investment vehicles do not have an impact to net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.  This measure is provided in addition to the Company's operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies.
