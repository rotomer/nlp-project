Comments on the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012 Results
Mark R. Fetting, Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason said, The quarter was marked by extreme market volatility and continued economic uncertainty that led to many investors moving to, or staying on, the sidelines. That said, Legg Mason's asset mix helped to mitigate a more significant decline in AUM that affected the industry as a whole.  In this environment, we will continue to maintain a tight focus on client service and performance, to preserve our balance sheet strength, complete the streamlining initiatives we began last year and prudently deploy capital for the benefit of shareholders.  Ultimately, these steps will position Legg Mason for long term success as we continue to expand and build our brand globally.
Assets Under Management Decreased to $611.8
Billion
AUM decreased to $611.8 billion compared with $662.5 billion at June 30, 2011 primarily driven by $32.9 billion in market depreciation, including foreign exchange, as well as client outflows of $17.6 billion. AUM was down 9% from $673.5 billion as of September 30, 2010.
Comparison to the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012
Net income was $56.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared with $60.0 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. This quarter's results included a United Kingdom tax benefit of $18.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.
Comparison to the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2011
Net income was $56.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared with $75.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. This quarter's results included a United Kingdom tax benefit of $18.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, while the prior year's second quarter included a similar $8.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share benefit.
Performance
At September 30, 2011:
Balance Sheet
At September 30, 2011, Legg Mason's cash position was $1.1 billion. Total debt was $1.4 billion and stockholders' equity was $5.6
billion. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total equity plus total debt excluding consolidated investment vehicles) was 20%. During the quarter, the Company completed additional open market purchases of 7.6
million shares, which reduced weighted average shares by 3.7 million. This brings the number of shares repurchased under the $1 billion Board authorization to 13.6 million shares in fiscal year 2012 and 28.2 million shares in total.
The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.08 per share. The dividend is payable January 9, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2011.

For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see "Risk Factors" and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Legg Mason's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 and in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) for Adjusted Income", Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles, and Operating Margin, As Adjusted that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Adjusted Income
We define Adjusted Income as Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non-core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as impairment charges and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill, and net money market fund support losses (gains).
We believe that Adjusted Income provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.
Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income, but is not a substitute for Net Income and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or Adjusted Income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Legg Mason considers Adjusted Income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, issued contingent convertible debt, or engaged in money market fund support transactions.
In calculating Adjusted Income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to reflect the fact that these non-cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business.  Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to net income in the calculation of Adjusted Income.  However, because of our net operating loss carry forward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non-cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment charges and United Kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite-life intangible assets, if applicable, that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non-cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non-core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of Legg Mason's operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. 
Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non-core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on Adjusted Income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.
Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.
Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles
In accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, Legg Mason consolidates and separately identifies certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity. In presenting our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles, we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non-operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment vehicles.
We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the consolidated investment vehicles from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by Legg Mason from consolidated investment vehicles are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non-operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment vehicles are removed from the GAAP basis Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to Legg Mason. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Statements of Income presented on a non-GAAP basis of other companies.
Operating Margin, As Adjusted
We  calculate Operating Margin, As Adjusted, by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition-related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles and, impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as adjusted operating revenues.  The compensation items, other than transition-related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non-operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.  Transition-related costs and income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from consolidated investment vehicles that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.  Legg Mason believes that Operating Margin, As Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income and because it indicates what Legg Mason's operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition-related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.  This measure is provided in addition to the Company's operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins of other companies.
