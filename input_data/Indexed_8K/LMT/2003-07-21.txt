Item 5. Other Events
 
On June 27, 2003, we filed a Form 8-K to report the formation of a new business segment, Integrated Systems and Solutions (ISS). In the Form 8-K, we reclassified historical segment information from amounts previously reported to reflect our new business segment. Certain of the historical segment information for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected in the Form 8-K was presented incorrectly between our Space Systems and ISS segments. We are filing this Form 8-K/A to correct the amounts reflected for 2001 net sales, operating profit, margins, backlog and assets for Space Systems and ISS in our prior Form 8-K. The information reflected for other segments and periods is unchanged. In addition, the amendment does not change our historical consolidated financial condition or operating results.
 
The following amends the 2001 information for Space Systems and ISS only:
 
We are filing this Form 8-K to report the formation of Integrated Systems and Solutions (ISS), a new business segment. ISS was formed by combining two existing Lockheed Martin operating companies  Mission Systems (which was previously reported in the Systems Integration business segment) and Management & Data Systems (which was previously reported in the Space Systems business segment), along with our Advanced Concepts organization. This new business segment will leverage our existing and emerging capabilities to address customers' growing needs for integrated, network-centric solutions. With the formation of ISS, the Systems Integration business segment has been renamed "Electronic Systems." The Aeronautics and Technology Services business segments were unaffected by these changes.
 
The Corporation now operates in five principal business segments. Following is a brief description of the activities of each business segment:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the following tables of selected financial data by business segment, the total of the operating results of the principal business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. With respect to the caption "Operating profit," the reconciling item "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net" includes the FAS/CAS adjustment related to pensions, earnings and losses from equity investments (mainly telecommunications), interest income, costs for stock-based award programs, items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, and Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments as well as other miscellaneous Corporate activities. For financial statement captions other than "Operating profit," all activities other than those pertaining to the principal business segments are included on a line item entitled "Other."
 
The following segment information has been reclassified from amounts previously reported to reflect our new business segment. Accordingly, there has been no change in the operating results reported for our business segments or in total for the Corporation.

The aggregate par value of all shares of all classes is $1,570,000,000.00.
 
A description of each class with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualification and terms and conditions of redemption of each class, is as follows:
 
 
SECTION 1.
Designation, Amount and Rank.
 
The class of Preferred Stock shall be designated "Series A Preferred Stock" and the authorized number of shares constituting such class shall be 20,000,000. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity as to dividends and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up with any other class of Preferred Stock which the Corporation may in the future issue and which by its terms is not stated to rank junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank senior, as to dividends and to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to all other classes or series of stock of the Corporation which are currently outstanding or which the Corporation may in the future issue.
 
SECTION 2.
Dividends.
 
(a) The holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, subject to the rights of holders of any class of Preferred Stock which the Corporation may in the future issue which ranks on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of dividends, and when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the per share rate of $.75 for each of the quarters ending on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and no more, payable in arrears on each succeeding April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1, respectively (each such date being hereinafter referred to as a "Preferred Dividend Payment Date" ) commencing on that Preferred Dividend Payment Date which next follows the issuance of such shares. Dividends shall (i) commence to accrue (whether or not declared and whether or not funds are legally available for payment) and shall be cumulative on the Series A Preferred Stock from and after the last dividend payment date with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock of Martin Marietta Corporation provided that all dividends have been paid through such last dividend payment date and (ii) shall compound quarterly, to the extent they are unpaid, at the rate of 6% per annum computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
 
 
30-day months. If any Preferred Dividend Payment Date shall not be a Business Day, then the Preferred Dividend Payment Date shall be on the next succeeding Business Day. Each such dividend will be payable to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Corporation on the record dates, not less than 10 nor more than 50 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close or a day which is or is declared a national or New York State holiday.
 
(b) Holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends on such shares, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided.
 
(c) (i) So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, no dividend or distribution whatsoever shall be declared or paid upon or set apart for any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in payment of dividends nor shall any shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in payment of dividends be redeemed or purchased by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof nor shall any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for redemption or purchase of any shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in payment of dividends, unless, in each such instance, full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods shall have been paid at the rate fixed therefor, the dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and sufficient funds set aside for payment thereof and all redemption payments with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock which the Corporation shall have become obligated to make shall have been made. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be permitted to purchase or acquire any preferred or common stock purchase rights of the Corporation ("Rights") distributed pursuant to any rights agreements to which it may be a party (the "Rights Agreement").
 
(ii) No dividend shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for any share of Series A Preferred Stock for any dividend period unless at the same time (a) a like proportionate dividend for the same dividend period shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for all shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend and (b) there shall have been paid upon or declared or set aside for all shares of any other class of stock or series thereof, if any, then outstanding and ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in payment of dividends, for the same dividend period of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends ratably in proportion to the respective dividend rates fixed for the Series A Preferred Stock and said parity stock. No dividend shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for any shares of any other class of stock or
 
 
series thereof, if any, then outstanding and ranking on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock in payment of dividends for any dividend period, unless there shall have been paid upon or declared or set apart for all shares then outstanding of Series A Preferred Stock, for the same dividend period, dividends ratably in proportion to the respective dividend rates fixed for the Series A Preferred Stock and said parity stock.
 
SECTION 3. .
Redemption
 
(a) On or after the fifth anniversary of April 2, 1993 (the "Initial Issuance Date"), the Corporation, at its option, may redeem any or all shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at a redemption price of $50 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared and whether or not funds are legally available for payment) to and including the date of redemption (the "Redemption Price"), but only if the Average Closing Price (as defined in Section 4(e)(vii) below) of the Common Stock (calculated as of the record date fixed in accordance with Section 3(c) for notifying holders of such redemption) equals or exceeds the applicable percentage of the Conversion Price (as defined in Section 4(a)) set forth below opposite the anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date that occurs on or that immediately preceded such record date:
 
 
Immediately prior to authorizing or making any such redemption with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation, by resolution of its Board of Directors, shall, to the extent of any funds legally available therefor, declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable on the redemption date in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock as of such date and, if the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available therefor to declare and pay all dividends accrued at the time of such redemption, then (i) the dividend shall be paid pro rata as among the Series A Preferred Stock and any other Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 2(c)(ii), and (ii) an amount equal to any remaining accrued and unpaid dividends shall be added to the redemption price of the Series A Preferred Stock.
 
(b) If less than all the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (subject to rounding to
 
avoid fractional shares) as nearly as practicable or by lot, or by such other method as the Board of Directors may determine to be equitable.
 
(c) Notice of any redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses appearing on the stock books of the Corporation. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall fix a record date for determining holders of record who are entitled to receive notice of any redemption, not more than 10 days prior to the mailing of such notice. Notice so mailed shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not actually received. Such notice shall state: (i) the date fixed for redemption; (ii) the Redemption Price; (iii) whether the Redemption Price will be paid in cash or, pursuant to Section 3(d) below, in Common Stock; (iv) that the holder has the right to convert such shares into Common Stock until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the related redemption date, together with a statement of the then effective Conversion Price and the place where certificates for such shares may be surrendered for conversion; (v) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be so redeemed from such holder; (vi) the place where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; (vii) that after the close of business on such date fixed for redemption the shares to be redeemed shall not accrue dividends; and (viii) if the Redemption Price will be paid in Common Stock, that the holder has the right to cause a Backstop Registration of such Common Stock as described below. Upon surrender in accordance with the aforesaid notice of the certificate for any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed (duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer, if so required by the Corporation in such notice), the holders of records of such shares shall be entitled to receive the Redemption Price, without interest. In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.
 
(d) At the option of the Corporation, if notice of redemption is mailed as aforesaid, and if prior to the date fixed for redemption funds or shares of Common Stock sufficient to pay in full the Redemption Price are deposited in trust, for the account of the holders of the shares to be redeemed, with a bank or trust company named in such notice doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, State of New York and having capital surplus and undivided profits of at least $500 million (which bank or trust company also may be the transfer agent and/or paying agent for the Series A Preferred Stock), notwithstanding the fact that any certificate(s) for shares called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, on and after such date of deposit the shares represented thereby so called for redemption shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and all rights of the holders of such shares as stockholders of the Corporation shall cease, except the right of the holders thereof to convert such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 at any time prior to the close of business on
 
the second Business Day immediately preceding the related redemption date and the right of the holders thereof to receive out of the funds or shares of Common Stock so deposited in trust the Redemption Price, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate(s) representing such shares. Any funds or shares of Common Stock so deposited with such bank or trust company in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted before the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the related redemption date shall be returned to the Corporation upon such conversion. Any funds or shares of Common Stock so deposited with such bank or trust company which shall remain unclaimed by the holders of shares called for redemption at the end of two years after the related redemption date shall be repaid to the Corporation, on demand, and thereafter the holder of any such shares shall look only to the Corporation for the payment, without interest thereon, of the Redemption Price.
 
(e) (i) In lieu of paying the Redemption Price in cash, the Corporation may, at its sole option, pay such Redemption Price in shares of Common Stock.
 
(ii) The number of shares of Common Stock issuable in lieu of a cash payment of the Redemption Price shall be the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock (which shares of Common Stock shall consist of authorized but unissued shares) as shall have an aggregate Specified Value (as defined below) as of the redemption date equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being redeemed. The shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from each holder; provided that, if the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by a holder which are subject to redemption as aforesaid is not a whole number, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed as aforesaid shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number. The shares of Common Stock issuable on any redemption to be paid in Common Stock will be delivered to the Corporation for the account of such holders. By their acceptance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, each holder thereof shall be deemed (i) to have accepted the appointment of the Corporation to act as such referred to below and (ii) to have appointed the Corporation as its attorney-in-fact for purposes of making any endorsements on certificates for shares of Common Stock received by such holder upon redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the extent any such endorsement is necessary or appropriate for purposes of effecting the sale of such shares of Common Stock in a Backstop Registration, as described below. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon redemption. A holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive such a fractional share shall, in lieu thereof, receive cash in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Specified Value.
 
(iii) For purposes hereof, "Specified Value" means the Average Closing Price (as defined in Section 4(e) (vii)) per share of Common Stock as of the applicable redemption date.
 
 
(iv) Before any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive certificates for shares of Common Stock in respect of the redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or cash representing fractional share settlements in respect thereof) such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates of shares of Series A Preferred Stock duly endorsed if required by the Corporation, at the office of the Corporation and, if certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be received by such holder, shall state in writing the name or names and the denominations in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for the Common Stock to be issued. The Corporation will, as soon as practicable after receipt thereof, issue and deliver to such holder, or such holder's designee or designees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with a certificate or certificates representing any shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are not to be redeemed, but which shall have constituted part of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificate so surrendered.
 
(v) Each redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock paid in Common Stock shall be deemed to have been made as of the close of business on the applicable redemption date, so that the rights of the holder of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall, to the extent of such redemption, cease at such time and the person or persons entitled to receive shares of the Common Stock upon redemption of such shares (including the person or persons to whom any shares of Common Stock shall have been sold pursuant to a Backstop Registration (as defined in Section 3(f)) shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or holders of the Common Stock at such time, provided, however, that in the event a dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger or similar event is declared or occurs with respect to the shares of Common Stock, and the record date for any such action is on or after the close of business on the record date for such redemption, but prior to the close of business on the date of such redemption, then the person or persons entitled to receive shares of the Common Stock upon redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including the person or persons to whom any shares of Common Stock shall have been sold pursuant to a Backstop Registration) shall be treated for purposes of such action as having become the record holder or holders of the Common Stock at the close of business on the Trading Day (as defined in Section 4(e)(vii)) next preceding the record date of such redemption. From and after the redemption, dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed with shares of Common Stock as a result of such redemption shall cease to accrue, and said shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding.
 
(vi) The Corporation will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Backstop Registration registered in a name other than the name (x) in which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were
 
 
formerly registered or (y) of any underwriter participating in such Backstop Registration, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
 
(f) (i) Within 15 days of its receipt of notice pursuant to Section 3(c) above of a redemption payable in shares of Common Stock, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect not to retain such Common Stock and to request a backstop registration (a "Backstop Registration") of the shares of Common Stock received in the redemption by delivering to the Corporation a written request specifying the amount of Common Stock that the holder proposes not to retain and to sell pursuant to the Backstop Registration. A holder's failure to timely deliver such notice shall be deemed to be an election by the holder thereof to retain such Common Stock.
 
(ii) The Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such shares to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit the sale thereof promptly. In connection therewith, the Corporation shall prepare, and within 120 days of the receipt of the request file, on Form S-3 if permitted or otherwise on the appropriate form, a registration statement under the Securities Act to effect such registration. Each holder requesting a Backstop Registration shall thereby be deemed to agree to provide all such information and materials and to take all such action as may be reasonably required in order to permit the Corporation to comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and to obtain any desired acceleration of the effective date of such registration statement. If the offering to be registered is to be underwritten, the managing underwriter shall be selected by the Corporation, and the Corporation and each requesting holder shall enter into an underwriting agreement containing customary terms and conditions. For purposes hereof the Common Stock required to be registered is referred to herein as the "Subject Stock." The Corporation shall not be required to include Subject Stock of any requesting holder therein if the requesting holder does not agree to offer its stock by or through the underwriters selected by the Corporation for the registration of the shares of Subject Stock and execute an underwriting agreement in customary form. If a requesting holder has been permitted to participate in a proposed offering pursuant to this Section 3(f), the Corporation thereafter may determine in its sole discretion either not to file a registration statement, or otherwise not to consummate such offering, in whole or in part, without any liability hereunder, except as provided herein.
 
(iii) In connection with any Backstop Registration of shares of Subject Stock registered pursuant hereto, the Corporation shall (A) furnish to the requesting holders such number of copies of any prospectus (including preliminary and summary prospectuses) and conformed copies of the registration statement (including amendments or supplements thereto and, in each case, all exhibits) and such other documents as they may reasonably request, but only while the Corporation shall cause the registration
 
 
statement to remain current; (B) (1) use its best efforts to register or qualify the Subject Stock covered by such registration statement under such blue sky or other state securities laws for offer and sale and (2) keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the registration statement remains in effect; (C) use its best efforts to cause all shares of Subject Stock covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other federal or state government agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the Corporation to enable the requesting holders to consummate the disposition of such shares of Subject Stock; (D) notify the requesting holders any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and at the request of the requesting holders promptly prepare and furnish to them a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; (E) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission; (F) use its best efforts to list the Subject Stock covered by such registration statement on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other securities exchange on which Subject Stock is then listed; and (G) before filing any registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, and as far in advance as is reasonably practicable, furnish to the requesting holders copies of such documents. In connection with any offering of Subject Stock registered pursuant to this Section 3(f), the Corporation shall (x) furnish to the underwriter unlegended certificates representing ownership of the Common Stock being sold in such denominations as requested and (y) instruct any transfer agent and registrar of the Subject Stock to release any stop transfer orders with respect to such Subject Stock. Upon any registration becoming effective pursuant to this Section 3(f), the Corporation shall use its best efforts to keep such registration statement current for a period of 60 days (or 90 days, if the Corporation is eligible to use a Form S3, or successor form) or such shorter period as shall be necessary to effect the distribution of the Subject Stock.
 
(iv) By requesting Backstop Registration, each requesting holder shall be deemed to agree that upon receipt or any notice from the Corporation of the happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (iii) (D) of this Section 3(f), it will forthwith discontinue its disposition of Subject Stock pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Subject Stock until its receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subdivision (iii)(D) of this Section 3(f) and, if so directed by the Corporation, will deliver to the Corporation all copies then in its possession of the prospectus relating to such Subject Stock current at the time of receipt of such notice.
 
 
(v) The Corporation shall pay all agent fees and commissions underwriting discounts and commissions related to shares of Subject Stock being sold by the requesting holders, the fees and disbursements of one counsel for the requesting holders which shall be selected by a majority in interest of the requesting holders and all other fees and expenses in connection with any registration statement hereunder, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, all printing costs, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws and fees and disbursements of the Corporation's counsel and accountants.
 
(vi) In the case of any offering registered pursuant hereto, the Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold the requesting holders, each underwriter of the Subject Stock under such registration and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and any officer, employee or partner of the foregoing, harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (including reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in the investigation and defense thereof) to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise (collectively "Losses"), insofar as any such Losses shall arise out of or shall be based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as amended if the Corporation shall have filed with the Commission any amendment thereof), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the prospectus relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as amended or supplemented if the Corporation shall have filed with the Commission any amendment thereof or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this Section 3(f)(vi) shall not apply to such Losses which shall arise out of or shall be based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, which shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Corporation by a requesting holder or any such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the registration statement or prospectus contained in the registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto.
 
In the case of each Backstop Registration pursuant to this Section 3(f), each requesting holder and each underwriter participating therein shall agree, substantially in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in the preceding paragraph, severally to indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and the directors and officers of the Corporation, with respect to any statement in or omission from such registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement (as amended
 
 
or as supplemented, if amended or supplemented as aforesaid) if such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Corporation by a requesting holder or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto.
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 3(f) is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified party harmless from any Losses in respect of which this Section 3(f) would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions provided herein), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by and fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the offering to which such contribution relates as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the amount of proceeds received by each party from the offering to which such contribution relates. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, each party's relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, and the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section 3(f) was available to such party.
 
(g) When the offering contemplated by Section 3(f) above has been completed, the net proceeds thereof shall be distributed to the requesting holders pro rata in respect of their interests in the Subject Stock. Any such offering not consummated within six months of delivery of the notice to the Corporation pursuant to Section 3(f)(i) shall be deemed to have been abandoned. To the extent the net proceeds per share to each requesting holder from such offering (treating the net proceeds as zero if such offering has been abandoned) are less than the sum of the Redemption Price and the Interest Amount (as defined below) in respect of such requesting holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section, the Corporation shall pay to each requesting holder an amount in cash equal to the applicable difference. "Interest Amount" means, with respect to the Redemption Price payable to any holder for such holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section, interest on such Redemption Price for each day, from the applicable redemption date to and including the date of payment pursuant to this Section 3(g) at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as reported by the U.S. Department of Treasury, for such day on U.S. Treasury Bonds maturing on the date that is the tenth anniversary of such redemption date (or if no U.S.
 
 
Treasury Bonds mature on such date, then on the date nearest to such date for which such a maturity exists).
 
SECTION 4.
Conversion Rights.
 
The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right at their option, to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock on the following terms and conditions:
 
(a) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share and prior to the close of business of the Corporation on the second Business Day immediately preceding any date set for the redemption thereof (provided that consideration sufficient to redeem all shares to be redeemed on such date has been paid or made available for payment on or prior to such date), at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing $50 by the Conversion Price, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. The price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion (the "Conversion Price") shall initially be $34.5525 per share of Common Stock. The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided. No payment or adjustment shall be made on account of any dividend on the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock if the record date for such dividend occurs prior to the date of such conversion. If any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be called for redemption, the right to convert the shares designated for redemption shall terminate after the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption unless default is made in the payment of the Redemption Price. In the event of default in the payment of the Redemption Price, the right to convert the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date that such default is cured.
 
(b) In order to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, the holder thereof shall surrender the certificates therefor, duly endorsed if the Corporation shall so require, or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer satisfactory to the Corporation, at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, or at such other office as may be designated by the Corporation, together with written notice that such holder irrevocably elects to convert such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Such notice shall also state the name and address in which such holder wishes the certificate for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion to be issued. As soon as practicable after receipt of the certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted and the notice of election to convert the same, the Corporation shall issue and deliver at said office a certificate for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion, together with a cash payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as hereinafter provided, to the person entitled to receive the same. If more than
 
 
one stock certificate for Series A Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by all the certificates so surrendered. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date such shares are surrendered for conversion and notice of election to convert the same is received by the Corporation in accordance with the foregoing provision, and the person entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Stock as of such date.
 
(c) Dividends shall cease to accrue on shares of Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion into Common Stock from and after the date of conversion; provided, however, that any accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared and whether or not funds are legally available for payment) upon such shares to and including the conversion date shall be paid in cash upon such conversion or as soon thereafter as permitted by law.
 
(d) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock is surrendered at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares so surrendered. If the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock results in a fractional share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall pay cash in lieu thereof in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Average Closing Price, determined as provided in subsection (vii) of Section 4(e) below, on the date on which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were duly surrendered for conversion, or if such date is not a Trading Date, on the next succeeding Trading Date.
 
(e) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
 
(i) In case the Corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock of the Corporation in Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for such determination. For purposes of this subsection, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation.
 
 
The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.
 
(ii) In case the Corporation shall issue shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock to any person (other than pursuant to (A) a dividend reinvestment plan, (B) the exercise of stock options granted with the approval of the Corporation's Board of Directors where the exercise price is not less than the Average Closing Price on the date the option was granted, (C) a restricted stock plan where the issuance is consistent with the past practices of Martin Marietta Corporation, Martin Marietta Technologies, Inc. or Lockheed Corporation, as determined by the Board of Directors, (D) a stock option or other stock incentive plan where the issuance is required in accordance with any obligation of Martin Marietta Corporation to provide benefits similar to those provided under certain plans of General Electric Company in effect prior to April 2, 1993 as determined by the Board of Directors, or (E) any option or other security of the Corporation issued in exchange for, or upon exercise or conversion of, any option or other security outstanding as of the Merger Date (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated August 29, 1994 among the Corporation, Martin Marietta Corporation and Lockheed Corporation) and theretofore issued by (X) Martin Marietta Corporation (provided that the exercise of any option or other security issued by Martin Marietta Corporation after April 2, 1993 with an exercise price less than the "Average Closing Price" (as defined in Section 4 of Article V of Martin Marietta Corporation's Charter) on the date of grant shall result in an adjustment under this clause (ii) to the same extent it would have resulted in an adjustment under Section 4 of Martin Marietta Corporation's Charter) or (Y) Lockheed Corporation), entitling such person to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share (or having a conversion, exercise or exchange price per share) in any case, less than the Average Closing Price per share (determined as provided in subsection (vii) below) of the Common Stock on the date of issuance (or in the case of any issuance of Common Stock, rights, warrants or such other securities to all holders of Common Stock, on the date fixed for the determination of the holders entitled to receive such Common Stock, rights, warrants or other securities), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date of such issuance or the date fixed for such determination, as the case may be, shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such issuance or the date fixed for such determination, as the case may be, plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into or for which such rights, warrants or other securities are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) would purchase at such Average Closing Price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of
 
 
Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such issuance or the date fixed for such determination, as the case may be, plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into or for which such rights, warrants or other securities are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable), such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the date following the date of such issuance or the date fixed for such determination, as the case may be. For the purposes of this subsection (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation. The Corporation will not issue any rights, warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation. If the Corporation adopts a shareholder rights plan ( a "Rights Plan"), and after any Distribution Date (as defined in such Rights Plan) thereunder, holders converting shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive the Rights (as defined in such Rights Plan) which would otherwise be attributable (but for the date of conversion) to the shares of Common Stock received upon such conversion, then adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made under this subsection (ii) as if the Rights were then being issued to holders of the Common Stock. If such an adjustment is made and the Rights are later redeemed, invalidated or terminated, then a corresponding reversing adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price, on an equitable basis, to take account of such event. However, the Corporation may elect to provide that each share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, whether or not issued after the Distribution Date for such Rights, will be accompanied by the Rights which would otherwise be attributable (but for the date of conversion) to such shares of Common Stock, in which event the preceding two sentences will not apply.
 
(iii) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
(iv) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock or any other class of capital stock of the Corporation evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding (x) any rights, warrants or other securities referred to in subsection (ii) above, (y) any regular quarterly dividend of the Corporation paid in cash out of
 
 
the consolidated earnings or consolidated retained earnings of the Corporation in an amount not exceeding 125% of the average of the four regular quarterly dividends paid by the Corporation for the immediately preceding four quarters (including for this purpose dividends paid by Martin Marietta Corporation prior to the Merger Date), and (z) any dividend or distribution referred to in subsection (i) above), the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Average Closing Price (determined as provided in subsection (vii) below) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and shall be described in a statement filed with the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such Average Closing Price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.
 
(v) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which Section 4(g) below applies) shall be deemed to involve (A) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of subsection (iv) above), and (B) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective" as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of subsection (iii) above).
 
(vi) In case at any time the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof shall repurchase, by self tender offer or otherwise, any shares of Common Stock of the Corporation at a weighted average purchase price in excess of the Average Closing Price (as defined in subsection (vii) below) on the Business Day immediately prior to the earliest of the date of such repurchase, the commencement of an offer to repurchase or the public announcement of either (such date being referred to as the "Determination Date"), the Conversion Price in effect as of such Determination Date shall be reduced by multiplying such
 
 
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be (I) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Determination Date and (y) the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock on such Determination Date minus (II) the aggregate purchase price of such repurchase and the denominator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Determination Date minus the number of shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company or any subsidiary thereof in such repurchase and (y) the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock on such Determination Date. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (vi) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such repurchase.
 
(vii) For the purposes of any computation under these provisions of the Corporation's Charter, the Average Closing Price per share of Common Stock on any day shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices for the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive Trading Days commencing 30 Trading Days before the day in question, with each day's closing sale price being the reported last sale price regular way or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, in either case on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is no longer listed or admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations National Market System or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter market as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Board of Directors for that purpose. As used herein, the term "Trading Day" shall mean a date on which the New York Stock Exchange (or any successor to such Exchange) is open for the transaction of business.
 
(viii) No adjustment in the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (viii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.
 
(f) Whenever the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as herein provided (i) the Corporation shall forthwith make available at the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock a statement describing in reasonable detail the adjustment, the facts requiring such adjustment and the method of calculation used; and (ii) the Corporation shall cause to be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, as soon as
 
 
practicable to each holder of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock a notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price.
 
(g) In the event that the Corporation shall be a party to any transaction constituting a recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of its assets, the holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, after such consolidation, merger, sale or exchange to convert such share into the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities, and the amount of cash or other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or exchange by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or exchange. No provision shall be made for adjustments in the Conversion Price. The provisions of this Section 4(g) shall similarly apply to any such successive event.
 
(h) The Corporation shall not be required to pay any taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance of shares of Common Stock in the name other than that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted are registered, and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares unless and until the person requesting such issuance in another name shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of any such taxes, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid.
 
(i) The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by subsections (i) through (vi) of Section 4(e) above, as it considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients.
 
(j) Except as provided in this Section 4, the Corporation will not, by amendment of its Charter or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.
 
(k) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.
 
(1) In the event that:
 
 
(i) the Corporation shall declare a dividend or any other distribution on its Common Stock (other than any regular quarterly dividend described in Section 4(e) (iv) above) payable otherwise than in cash out of consolidated earnings or consolidated retained earnings;
 
(ii) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of its Common Stock of rights to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any other rights;
 
(iii) any capital reorganization of the Corporation, reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, or sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation occurs;
 
(iv) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation occurs; or
 
(v) any other event for which an adjustment would be required pursuant to subsections (i) through (vi) of Section 4(e) or pursuant to Section 4(g) occurs;
 
the Corporation shall cause to be mailed to the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or other event specified in subsections (i) through (v) of this Section 4(1) is expected to take place, and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or other such event. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up or other such event.
 
SECTION 5. .
Voting Rights
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5 or as required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter on which the holders of any voting securities of the Corporation shall be entitled to vote.
 
 
(b) Upon a default with respect to the Corporation's senior bank facility or any successor thereto or replacement thereof (as amended from time to time, the "Senior Bank Facility") that is not substantially cured within six months from the declaration thereof pursuant to the Senior Bank Facility (but without regard to any waivers granted by the lenders under such Senior Bank Facility) (a "Bank Debt Default"), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect the smallest number of directors of the Corporation's Board of Directors that shall constitute no less than 25% of the authorized number of directors of the Corporation's Board of Directors until such right is terminated as provided herein. The voting rights provided by this Section 5(b) shall terminate immediately upon the initial holder of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock being no longer entitled to designate any director pursuant to Section 3.02 of the Standstill Agreement dated April 2, 1993 between the Corporation (as successor to Martin Marietta Corporation pursuant to, and as such Standstill Agreement is modified by, the Reconfiguration Agreement dated August, 1993 among the Corporation, Martin Marietta Corporation and General Electric Company), as so amended, and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, following such termination, shall have only the voting rights provided by Sections 5(c), (d) and (e) below or as otherwise required by law.
 
(c) In the event that dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six quarters (whether or not consecutive) (a "Preferred Dividend Default") and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are not then represented on the Corporation's Board of Directors by directors elected as a result of a Bank Debt Default, a majority in interest of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class with holders of shares of any other class of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, shall be entitled to elect two directors of the Corporation until such right is terminated as provided herein.
 
(d) (i) Upon the occurrence of a Bank Debt Default or a Preferred Dividend Default, the Board of Directors of the Company shall promptly call a special meeting of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (and, in the case of a Preferred Dividend Default, any holders of shares of any other class of Preferred Stock who are then entitled to participate in the election of such directors) for the purpose of electing the directors provided by the foregoing provisions; provided that, in lieu of holding such meeting, the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock (and, in the case of a Preferred Dividend Default, the holders of any such other Preferred Stock) may, by action taken by written consent as permitted by law and the Charter and Bylaws of the Corporation, elect such directors. At elections for such directors, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held. Upon the vesting of voting rights in the holders of Series A Preferred Stock as a result of a Preferred Dividend Default or a Bank Debt Default, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two (or such greater number as may be required in respect of a Bank Debt Default). The two vacancies (or greater number) so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (and, in the case of a Preferred Dividend Default, the holders of any such other Preferred
 
Stock). The right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class (except as aforesaid), to elect members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation in the manner described above shall continue until such time as any Bank Debt Default shall have ceased (other than as a result of any waiver, amendment or accommodation granted by the lenders under such Senior Bank Facility), or all dividends accumulated on Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, as the case may be, at which time such right shall terminate, except as required by law, subject to vesting in the event of each and every subsequent Bank Debt Default and Preferred Dividend Default.
 
(ii) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (and, in the case of a Preferred Dividend Default, the holders of shares of any other class of Preferred Stock who are then entitled to vote on the election of directors) to vote as a class for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by holders of Series A Preferred Stock (or such other holders, as the case may be) voting as a class (hereunder referred to as a "Preferred Stock Director") shall terminate immediately. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed by, and shall not be removed otherwise than by, the vote of the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock (or, in the case of any Preferred Stock Director elected as a result of a Preferred Dividend Default, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock together with holders of any other Preferred Stock that participated in the election of such Preferred Stock Director) voting as a separate class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written consent as permitted by law and the Charter and Bylaws of the Corporation. If the office of any Preferred Stock Director becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or otherwise, the remaining Preferred Stock Director or Directors may choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred or, if none remains in office, by vote of the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock (or, in the case of any Preferred Stock Director elected as a result of a Preferred Dividend Default, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock together with holders of any other Preferred Stock that participated in the election of such Preferred Stock Director). Holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not, as such stockholders, be entitled to vote on the election or removal of directors other than Preferred Stock Directors. Whenever the special voting powers vested in the holders of Series A Preferred Stock as provided herein shall have expired, the number of directors shall become such number as may be provided for in the Bylaws, irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions hereof.
 
(iii) So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting separately as a class) given in person or by proxy, at any special or annual meeting called for such purpose, or by written consent as permitted by law and the Charter and Bylaws of the Corporation, shall be necessary to amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Charter of the Corporation which would adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of Series A Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any such amendment, alteration or repeal, that would
 
authorize, create or issue any additional shares of Preferred Stock or any other shares of stock (whether or not already authorized) ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall be deemed not to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.
 
(e) The holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote together with the holders of shares of Common Stock and to cast the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are then convertible in the event of any merger, consolidation or business combination or share exchange involving the Corporation or any sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation upon which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to vote, provided, however, that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote upon acquisitions which, within any 12-month period, do not (i) involve greater than an aggregate of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) of transaction value (including assumed liabilities, whether contingent or not) or (ii) adversely affect the economic or legal position of the Series A Preferred Stock or its rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.
 
(f) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed for cash or converted for Common Stock and funds, if any, necessary for such redemption or conversion shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.
 
SECTION 6. .
Liquidation Rights
 
(a) Subject to the rights of holders of any class of Preferred Stock which the Corporation may in the future issue which ranks on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (collectively, a "Liquidation"), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, before any distribution or payment is made to holders of Common Stock of the Corporation or on any other class of stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to assets distributable upon Liquidation to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock upon a Liquidation, liquidating distributions in the amount of $50 per share, plus the amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon (including dividends accumulated and unpaid) to the date of Liquidation, and no more.
 
(b) Written notice of any Liquidation, stating the payment date or dates when and the place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock
 
at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock.
 
(c) Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the assets of the Corporation, shall, without further corporate action, be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
 
SECTION 7. .
Tax Provisions
 
(a) The Corporation will treat the Series A Preferred Stock as equity (not debt) for all federal, state, local and other tax purposes.
 
(b) The Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that it has adequate earnings and profits, within the meaning of Section 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code ), or any successor provision, to ensure that all dividend distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock and all distributions in redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock that are treated as distributions with respect to stock under Section 302(d) of the Code (or any successor provision) will be treated as dividends within the meaning of Section 316 of the Code (or any successor provision); provided that such reasonable best efforts shall not require the Corporation to incur any material out-of-pocket costs unless such costs are reimbursed by the initial holder of the Series A Preferred Stock.

(f) any reclassification of securities or recapitalization that would have the effect of increasing the voting power of a Related Person; or
 
(g) any agreement, contract, or other arrangement providing for any of the transactions described in this definition of Business Combination.

(a) was a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation immediately prior to the time that the Related Person involved in a Business Combination became the Beneficial Owner of 10% of any class or series of Voting Stock of the Corporation; or

In determining the Highest Per Share Price and Highest Equivalent Price, all purchases after the Merger Date by the Related Person shall be taken into account regardless of whether the shares were purchased before or after the Related Person became a Related Person. Also, the Highest Per Share Price and the Highest Equivalent Price shall include any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes, and soliciting dealers' fees paid by the Related Person with respect to the shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation acquired by the Related Person. In the case of any Business Combination with a Related Person, the Highest Equivalent Price for each class and series of the Voting Stock of the Corporation shall be determined by the Continuing Directors.
