Information
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, January 27, 2004  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported record net sales of $31.8 billion in 2003, a 20% increase over 2002 sales of $26.6 billion. Sales grew in all business segments in 2003. The Corporation booked more than $38 billion of orders in 2003, increasing its year-end backlog to a record $76.9 billion.
 
Net earnings for 2003 were $1.1 billion ($2.34 per diluted share) compared to $500 million ($1.11 per diluted share) in 2002. Cash provided by operating activities for 2003 was $1.8 billion, after a discretionary pre-funding of $450 million in December for future defined benefit pension plan contributions.
 
"We continued to execute our disciplined growth strategy in 2003. Our operational and financial performance, and strong cash flow, enabled us to deploy cash to enhance long-term shareholder value," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vance Coffman. "We are focused on generating profitable growth and providing the best solutions to our customers with an emphasis on Defense, Government Information Technology and Homeland Security. We look forward to supporting initiatives to reinvigorate space exploration. Lockheed Martin and its innovative team of 130,000 dedicated employees are well positioned for continued success."

*Mid-point of ($300)($550) million range.
 
Sales and Net Earnings
 
Net sales for the quarter were $9.0 billion, a 15% increase over the $7.8 billion recorded in the comparable 2002 period. Net sales were $31.8 billion in 2003, a 20% increase over 2002 sales of $26.6 billion.
 
Net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2003 were $344 million ($0.77 per share), including an $8 million gain ($0.02 per share) from the sale of the Corporation's commercial IT business. The net loss for the comparable 2002 quarter was $347 million ($0.77 per share). The 2002 results included charges for the impairment of telecommunications equity investments and Space Imaging, a charge related to a Russian launch services provider, and a loss from discontinued operations. The combined effect of these items decreased fourth quarter 2002 earnings by $727 million ($1.62 per share).
 
Net earnings for 2003 were $1.1 billion ($2.34 per diluted share). The 2003 results included the gain on the sale of the commercial IT business and previously reported net charges of $110 million ($0.24 per share) primarily associated with the early retirement of long-term debt and the exit from the commercial mail sorting business. The combined effect of these items was to decrease 2003 earnings by $102 million ($0.22 per share).
 
Net earnings for 2002 were $500 million ($1.11 per diluted share). The 2002 results included the previously mentioned 2002 items and a research and development tax credit benefit. The combined effect of these items decreased 2002 net earnings by $665 million ($1.47 per share).
 
Cash Flow and Leverage
 
In 2003, the Corporation continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and deploy cash to enhance long-term shareholder value. The Corporation reduced its debt and restructured its debt portfolio to lower interest expense. The Corporation also repurchased its common shares, doubled its dividend and pursued selective acquisitions to strengthen its capabilities in providing information technology services to defense, intelligence and other government customers.
 
Cash provided by operating activities for 2003 was $1.8 billion, after a December 2003 discretionary contribution of $450 million to pre-fund the 2004 defined benefit pension plan CAS contribution.
 
During the year, the Corporation used $2.4 billion for the early retirement of debt and related costs and the payment of scheduled debt maturities. The Corporation also completed the sale of $1.0 billion of convertible floating rate senior debentures. These actions reduced the Corporation's long-term debt by $1.4 billion from the year-end 2002 balance, lowered annual interest costs and improved the ratio of debt-to-total capitalization to 48%, compared to 56% at December 31, 2002.
 
Cash of $482 million was used to repurchase 10.7 million of the Corporation's common shares during 2003.
 
Capital expenditures for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 were $320 million and $687 million, compared to the $266 million and $662 million expended in the 2002 periods. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.0 billion, and its short-term investments were $240 million.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment earnings before interest and taxes (operating profit) and included in "Unallocated corporate income (expense), net."
 
"Unallocated corporate income (expense), net" includes earnings and losses from equity investments (mainly telecommunications), interest income, corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, costs for stock-based compensation programs, unusual items not considered in the evaluation of segment operating performance, and other miscellaneous corporate activities.
 
The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are reported in the business segment operating performance, and pension expense or income determined in accordance with FAS 87. CAS is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. The CAS amount is recovered over time through pricing of products and services on U.S. Government contracts.
 
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments. The Corporation changed the name of its Technology Services business segment to "Information & Technology Services" to better reflect the full scope of its business activities. The following table presents the operating results of the five business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated net sales and operating profit as determined by GAAP.
 
 
Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net is summarized below:
 
 
The changes in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were mainly due to the Corporation reporting FAS pension expense
 
versus FAS pension income in the comparable periods of the prior year. The change in "Other" unallocated corporate (expense) income, net for the quarter over the comparable 2002 period, was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our stock price, which increased stock-based compensation expense.
 
"Unusual Items" for 2003 included the fourth quarter gain on the sale of the commercial IT business, costs associated with the early retirement of debt and the exit from the commercial mail sorting business. The 2002 amounts included charges for the impairment of telecommunications equity investments and Space Imaging and a charge related to a Russian launch services provider.
 
The following discussion compares the operating results of each business segment for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 to the same periods in 2002.
 
 
Aeronautics
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 58% for both the quarter and year in 2003 due to growth in the Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility lines of business. For both the quarter and the year, approximately half the growth in Combat Aircraft was due to higher volume on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program with a majority of the remaining growth attributable to F-16 programs as a result of increased deliveries. In the fourth quarter of 2003, 22 F-16's were delivered, 17 more than in the 2002 period. In 2003, 62 F-16's were delivered, 41 more than in 2002. Increased C-130J deliveries contributed $300 million to the quarter-over-quarter increase in sales and $470 million to the year-over-year growth in sales. In the fourth quarter of 2003, there were six C-130J deliveries as compared to two deliveries in the 2002 period. For the full year, there were 15 C-130J deliveries compared to eight deliveries in 2002.
 
Segment operating profit in 2003 increased by 44% for the quarter and 54% for the year compared to the 2002 periods. For the quarter and the year, operating profit was higher primarily due to the impact of the volume increases in Combat Aircraft and performance on
 
other programs. The increase in C-130J deliveries did not impact operating profit for the comparative periods due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program. Backlog increased primarily as a result of booking the C-130J U.S. Government multi-year and international F-16 contracts.
 
 
Electronic Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Electronic Systems decreased by 5% for the quarter and increased by 4% for the year compared to the 2002 periods. For the quarter, the sales decrease was attributable to lower volume in Platform, Training & Transportation Systems (PT&TS) and Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2), which more than offset an increase in Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). The PT&TS decline of $225 million was the result of lower volume on transportation and security system activities and distribution technology programs. Approximately $150 million of this decline is attributable to the 2002 rapid deployment of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) programs. In M&FC, sales increased by $125 million over the comparable 2002 quarter due to growth in tactical missile, combat vision and air defense programs.
 
For the year, sales increases in M&FC and MS2 more than offset a decline at PT&TS. Increased volume in air defense and tactical missile programs accounted for most of M&FC's $250 million sales growth over 2002. In MS2, the $155 million increase in sales was primarily due to higher volume on radar and surface systems programs. As in the quarter, PT&TS' $100 million sales decrease for the year was mainly due to lower levels of transportation and security systems activities.
 
Segment operating profit decreased by 13% for the quarter and 2% for the year in 2003, compared to the 2002 periods. For the quarter, operating profit was lower primarily due to the impact of the volume declines at PT&TS. Additionally, a provision for $25 million was established at M&FC for the likely exercise of early production options on a tactical missile program. This program is successfully progressing through its development stage, making the exercise of the remaining early production options probable. Future production orders
 
beyond these are expected to be profitable. For the year, operating profit declined by $40 million at PT&TS due to a mix of program maturity and initial development activities on platform integration programs, as well as the impact of the decline in volume in transportation and security system activities. These decreases more than offset a $25 million increase in operating profit primarily attributable to higher volume on air defense programs at M&FC. The increase in backlog for the year resulted from increased orders on development programs which more than offset declines in orders on mature production programs.
 
 
Space Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased 11% for the quarter and 14% for the year in 2003 compared to the 2002 periods. For the quarter, the sales growth over the 2002 period was primarily attributable to an increase of $75 million in Launch Services (primarily due to increased Titan activities) and $50 million in Strategic and Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS). In Launch Services there were two Atlas launches in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to one Atlas and one Proton launch in the 2002 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, sales increased by $570 million in Satellites and $140 million in S&DMS compared to 2002. The growth in Satellites is due to higher volume on government satellite programs. The growth in S&DMS is attributable to increases in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense activities. In Launch Services, increased Titan activities offset lower sales resulting from a decline in Proton deliveries (two in 2003 and four in 2002). There were five Atlas launches in both 2003 and 2002.
 
Space Systems' operating profit increased by 56% for the quarter and 44% for the year in 2003 compared to the 2002 periods. In the quarter, Launch Services' operating profit increased $50 million due to the effect of a $35 million charge in 2002 for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs and improved performance and risk retirement
 
activities in 2003 on the maturing Titan program. S&DMS' operating profit increased by $20 million due to the impact of the volume increases discussed above. Satellites' operating profit declined in the fourth quarter from the comparable 2002 period, primarily due to the benefit of closing out certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts in 2002.
 
For the year, Satellites' operating profit increased by $70 million over the 2002 period mainly due to improved performance on commercial satellite activities and volume increases on government satellite programs, including the impact of a $30 million charge recorded in the third quarter 2003 related to a handling incident on a NASA satellite program. In Launch Services, operating profit increased by $35 million. The increase was primarily due to improved performance and risk retirement activities on the maturing Titan program, which were partially offset by the impact of a decline in Proton launches in 2003. S&DMS' operating profit increased by $20 million due to the impact of the volume increases discussed above. Backlog increased mainly due to an increase in orders for launch services, commercial satellites and missile defense activities.
 
 
Integrated Systems & Solutions
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S) increased by 6% for the quarter and 13% for the year in 2003 from the 2002 periods. For both the quarter and year, the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
 
Segment operating profit increased 38% for the quarter and 21% for the year from the comparable 2002 periods. The increase in operating profit for both the quarter and year were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above. Backlog increased due to a higher volume of classified orders in 2003.
 
Information & Technology Services
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Information & Technology Services increased by 3% for the quarter and 2% for the year in 2003 from the 2002 periods. For the quarter, the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of $100 million in Information Technology. Information Technology's results included the net impact of the Corporation's purchase of the ACS federal government IT business and the concurrent sale of its commercial IT business in November of this year. This sales increase was partially offset by declines in volume totaling $75 million in Defense Services, which was attributable to Transportation Security Administration activities in 2002 that did not recur in 2003, and the decline in NASA program sales. The sales increase for the year was mainly the result of volume increases of $110 million in Information Technology, which more than offset lower sales volume totaling $40 million on Defense Services and NASA programs.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 38% for the quarter and 28% for the year from the 2002 periods. For the quarter, operating profit increased mainly due to improved performance in Defense Services and NASA programs. Operating profit increased for the year mainly due to the higher volume in Information Technology and improved performance across all lines of business. Backlog increased mainly due to the fourth quarter 2003 acquisition and as a result of a higher volume of Information Technology orders.
 
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
 
The business outlook excludes the effect of the proposed acquisition of The Titan Corporation. The Corporation does not incorporate adjustments to its business outlook and financial projections for proposed acquisitions or divestitures until the transaction is closed. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the Corporation's Safe Harbor discussion at the end of this press release.
 
Forecasted sales for 2004 are expected to be $33.5 - $34.5 billion. This range is $500 million higher than previous estimates of $33.0 - $34.0 billion, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the ACS federal government IT business.
 
The 2004 earnings projection assumes profit from operating segments of $2,650 - $2,750 million. This range is $50 million higher than previous guidance of $2,600 - $2,700 million, reflecting the acquisition of the ACS federal government IT business, and an improved outlook in the Space Systems' business segment.
 
Based on the change in long-term corporate bond rates from the end of 2002 to the end of 2003, the 2004 pension discount rate assumption was revised from the previous rate of 6.75% to a current rate of 6.25%. The FAS pension expense is now expected to be approximately $900 million while CAS pension expense is expected to be approximately $300 million. As a result, the 2004 FAS/CAS pension adjustment, included in "Unallocated corporate income (expense), net" is expected to be an expense of approximately $600 million, an increase from the prior projection of $400 - $550 million. The projected FAS/CAS pension adjustment assumes passage of legislation currently being considered by Congress that would affect the pension contribution requirements.
 
Other unallocated corporate items are expected to be an expense of $0 - $50 million, a $25 million decrease from the prior range of $25 million of income to $25 million of expense.
 
Interest expense for 2004 is expected to be $425 - $450 million.
 
Earnings per share in 2004 are estimated to range between $2.40 - $2.50.
 
Forecasted sales for 2005 are anticipated to be $34.0 - $36.0 billion. The 2005 projections assume profit from operating segments of $2,800 - $3,000 million, other unallocated corporate expense items of $0 - $50 million, and interest expense of $425 - $450 million. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment expense for 2005 is expected to range between $300 - $550 million based on assumptions in effect at December 2003, including the discount and long-term asset return rates.
 
Earnings per share in 2005 are estimated to range between $2.85 - $3.20.
 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be at least $2.0 billion in 2004 and at least $4.0 billion over the combined two-year period 2004 and 2005. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment are projected at approximately $800 million in each year. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of purchased intangibles is expected to be $675 - $700 million in 2004 and $700 - $750 million in 2005.
