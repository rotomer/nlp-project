BETHESDA, Maryland, April 27, 2004  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported first quarter 2004 net earnings of $291 million ($0.65 per diluted share) compared to $250 million ($0.55 per diluted share) in 2003. Net sales were $8.3 billion, an 18% increase over first quarter 2003 sales of $7.1 billion. Sales grew in all business segments during the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2004 was $1.1 billion.
 
Lockheed Martin announced an increase to its 2004 outlook for sales, earnings per share and cash from operations. The outlook for 2004 earnings per share has improved by $0.10, to $2.50 - $2.60 and cash from operations by $400 million, to approximately $2.4 billion.
 
"Our first quarter results demonstrate our focus on generating cash flow commensurate with our growth in sales and profits", said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vance Coffman. "We continue to focus on the successful execution of our backlog, leveraging all of our capabilities to achieve customer satisfaction and profitable growth and winning new business opportunities in our core markets."

Cash Flow, Leverage and Backlog
 
Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2004 was $1.1 billion before capital expenditures of $106 million. At March 31, 2004, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.1 billion. The ratio of debt-to-capitalization was 47% at the end of the first quarter, an improvement from 48% at December 31, 2003. The Corporation's backlog was $75.6 billion at March 31, 2004, compared to $76.9 billion at December 31, 2003.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments. Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment earnings before interest and taxes (operating profit) and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." (See our 2003 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.)
 
The following table presents the operating results of the five business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's financial results as determined by GAAP.
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results of each business segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 to the same period in 2003.
 
Aeronautics
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 38% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 from 2003 due to growth in the Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility lines of business. Combat Aircraft sales growth of $750 million was primarily due to higher volume on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and on F-16 programs as a result of increased deliveries. Increased C-130J deliveries, four in 2004 compared to three in 2003, contributed to the revenue growth in Air Mobility.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 42% in the first quarter of 2004 when compared to 2003. Operating profit was higher primarily due to the impact of increases in aircraft deliveries and volume in Combat Aircraft programs and the return to profitability in 2004 on C-130J deliveries.
 
Electronic Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to 2003. The sales increase was primarily attributable to higher volume in surface system programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) and in combat vision programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC).
 
Segment operating profit increased by 10% for the quarter in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating profit was higher primarily due to improved performance on tactical missile and air defense programs at M&FC and distribution technology programs at Platform, Training & Transportation Systems.
 
Space Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased 3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to 2003. The sales growth was primarily attributable to an increase in Launch Services (two Atlas launches in 2004 compared to none in 2003), which more than offset a decline in Satellites due to one less commercial satellite delivery.
 
Space Systems' operating profit increased by 15% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Launch Services' operating profit increased due to the benefit resulting from the termination of a launch vehicle contract by a commercial customer and U.S. Government support of the Atlas program, which more than offset a decline in activities on the maturing Titan launch vehicle program. Satellites' operating profit declined due to performance on certain government satellite programs, which more than offset improved performance in commercial satellites.
 
Integrated Systems & Solutions
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S) increased by 17% and operating profit increased 11% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 from the comparable 2003 period. These increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
 
Information & Technology Services
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Information & Technology Services (I&TS) increased by 24% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of $120 million in Information Technology. Information Technology's results included the net impact of the Corporation's November 2003 purchase of the ACS federal government IT business and the concurrent sale of its commercial IT business, as well as organic growth on existing IT programs. The remaining increase in sales was attributable to higher volume in Defense Services, which were partially offset by a decline in NASA program sales.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 25% for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 from the comparable 2003 period. Operating profit increased mainly due to the higher volume in Information Technology.
