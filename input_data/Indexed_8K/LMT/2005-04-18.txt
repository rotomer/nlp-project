On April 18, 2005, Lockheed Martin Corporation issued a press release, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
 
 
On April 18, 2005, the Corporation announced that it intends to adopt Financial Accounting Standard 123R, Share-Based Payments, effective as of January 1, 2006, consistent with the SEC's recent decision to defer the compliance date for the standard by six months. Prior to the SEC action, Lockheed Martin had indicated that it planned to adopt the standard prospectively as of July 1, 2005. Lockheed Martin plans to use the additional time to continue to review and understand the impact of adopting the standard. The Corporation also had previously disclosed that the expected impact of implementing the new standard would be a reduction in earnings per share of approximately $0.10 to $0.20 on a full year basis. The Corporation has not finalized its implementation methodology, including the selection of a valuation model. As a result, the ultimate impact of adopting FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 is not yet known.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Information
 
 
 
BETHESDA, MD, April 18, 2005  Lockheed Martin Corporation [NYSE: LMT] announced today that it intends to adopt Financial Accounting Standard 123R, Share-Based Payments, effective as of January 1, 2006, consistent with the SEC's recent decision to defer the compliance date for the standard by six months. Prior to the SEC action, Lockheed Martin had planned to adopt the standard based on its original compliance date of July 1, 2005. FAS 123R requires mandatory recognition of compensation expense for stock options and other share-based payments.
 
Lockheed Martin plans to use the additional time to continue to review and understand the impact of adopting the standard. The Corporation had previously disclosed that the expected impact of implementing the new standard would be a reduction in earnings per share of approximately $0.10 to $0.20 on a full year basis. The Corporation has not finalized its implementation methodology, including the selection of a valuation model. The ultimate impact of adopting FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 is not yet known.
 
In its previous outlook for 2005 earnings per share (provided on January 27, 2005), the Corporation indicated that it had included estimated stock option expense of approximately 8-10 cents per share in its 2005 earnings outlook based on the prospective application of FAS 123R in the second half of 2005.
 
Lockheed Martin will announce first quarter 2005 financial results on April 26, 2005 and expects to reflect the above change as well as any other factors impacting its 2005 outlook at that time.
 
Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs about 130,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and integration of advanced technology systems, products and services. The corporation reported 2004 sales of $35.5 billion.
