Information
 
For Immediate Release
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, April 26, 2005  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported first quarter 2005 net earnings of $369 million ($0.83 per diluted share) compared to $291 million ($0.65 per diluted share) in 2004. Net sales were $8.5 billion, a 2% increase over first quarter 2004 sales of $8.3 billion. Cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2005 was $1.5 billion.
 
Lockheed Martin announced an increase to its 2005 outlook for sales and earnings per share, while maintaining its outlook for cash from operations of at least $3 billion. The outlook for 2005 sales has been increased to a range of $36.5 - $38.0 billion, and the outlook for 2005 earnings per share has been increased to a range of $3.35 - $3.55.
 
"We are off to an excellent start for 2005," said Bob Stevens, President & CEO. "We are continuing to deliver on our focus of improving profitability, generating strong cash flow, and deploying cash to enhance shareholder value."
 
SUMMARY REPORTED RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
 
The following table presents the Corporation's first quarter results on a GAAP basis:
 
REPORTED RESULTS
(In millions, except per share data)
 
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
The Corporation has updated its outlook for 2005 as presented below:
 
OUTLOOK
(In millions, except per share data)
 
 
The outlook for 2005 reflects improved operating performance primarily in the Space Systems segment, the expected accretion resulting from completing the acquisitions of The SYTEX Group, Inc. and STASYS Limited during the first quarter, the benefit of first quarter unusual items, and the removal of estimated stock option expense as a result of deferring FAS 123R adoption until January 1, 2006.
 
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
 
Sales and Net Earnings
 
Net sales for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a 2% increase over the $8.3 billion recorded in the comparable 2004 period.
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $369 million ($0.83 per share). The first quarter results include an after-tax gain of $31 million ($0.07 per share) for the sale of the Intelsat investment and an after-tax loss of $19 million ($0.04 per share) related to an impairment in the value of a single telecommunications satellite operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. On a combined basis, these items increased first quarter 2005 net earnings by $12 million ($0.03 per share).
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $291 million ($0.65 per share).
 
Cash Flow and Leverage
 
Cash from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 was $1.5 billion. Additionally, the Corporation sold its Intelsat investment for $752 million. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy during the quarter as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 41% at the end of the first quarter, an improvement from 42% at December 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, the Corporation's cash and short-term investments were $3.1 billion.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). The results of Electronics, IS&S and I&TS have been aggregated into the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology and systems integration solutions across these segments.
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2004 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment.
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics, and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's financial results as determined by GAAP.
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results of each business segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 to the same period in 2004.
 
Systems & IT Group
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Sales increases in Electronic Systems and IS&S were slightly offset by a decline in I&TS.
 
In Electronic Systems, the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume in surface system programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) and in platform integration activities at Platform Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS). These increases more than offset a decline in volume on air defense programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). In IS&S, the increase was primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, lower volume on NASA programs more than offset a double-digit increase in Information Technology sales.
 
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 13% for the quarter in 2005 compared to 2004. All three businesses reported growth in operating profit during the quarter.
 
In Electronic Systems, the increase was due to improved performance on fire control and air defense programs at M&FC. Operating profit increases due to volume on surface systems programs at MS2 offset a slight decline in distribution technology programs at PT&TS. In IS&S, the increase was primarily attributable to a higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, the increase was due to higher volume in Information Technology and improved performance in Defense Services.
 
Aeronautics
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 from 2004 due to a decline in Combat Aircraft, which more than offset higher volume in Air Mobility. The Combat Aircraft sales decrease of 9% was primarily due to lower volume on F-16 and other combat aircraft programs. Higher volume on the C-5 and other programs contributed to the revenue growth in Air Mobility.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 2004. Operating profit was higher primarily due to the volume increases discussed above and improved performance on the C-130 and other programs in Air Mobility, which were partially offset by lower Combat Aircraft operating profit related to the reduced volume mentioned above.
 
Space Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased 5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared to 2004. The sales growth was primarily attributable to an increase in Satellites, where higher volume on government satellite programs more than offset a decline in commercial satellites. No commercial satellites were delivered this quarter as compared to one in 2004. A slight increase in Launch Services more than offset a decline in Strategic and Defensive Missile Systems. There were two Atlas launches and one Proton launch in the first quarters of both 2005 and 2004.
 
Space Systems' operating profit increased by 28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Satellites' operating profit increased due to volume and improved performance on government satellite programs, which more than offset a decline in commercial satellites due to no satellite deliveries this quarter. In Launch Services, operating profit was lower this quarter due to the benefit in 2004 resulting from the termination of a launch vehicle contract by a commercial customer, which was partially offset by a more profitable Proton launch in 2005.
