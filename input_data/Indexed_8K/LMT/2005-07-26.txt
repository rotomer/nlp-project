Information
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, July 26, 2005  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported second quarter 2005 net earnings of $461 million ($1.02 per diluted share) compared to $296 million ($0.66 per diluted share) in 2004. The second quarter results include a gain of $27 million ($0.06 per share) related to the Corporation's investment in Inmarsat.
 
Net sales were $9.3 billion, a 6% increase over second quarter 2004 sales of $8.8 billion. Cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2005 was $697 million, after the Corporation contributed $450 million to its defined benefit pension plans' trust to pre-fund the majority of its anticipated 2006 funding requirements.
 
"We had excellent operational and financial performance in the second quarter driven by double-digit growth in our Systems and IT Group", said Bob Stevens, Chairman, President and CEO. "Every business segment increased earnings in the quarter compared to the prior year, and we're pleased to increase our 2005 outlook for EPS and ROIC. These increases are the result of our continued focus on meeting our customer commitments, capturing new orders, improving productivity, and generating cash."
 
SUMMARY REPORTED RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
 
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarter and year-to-date periods on a GAAP basis:
 
  
REPORTED RESULTS
 
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
  
OUTLOOK
 
 
The increase in projected 2005 diluted earnings per share (prior range $3.35-$3.55) reflects improved operating performance in the Systems & IT Group and the Space Systems segment, a slight reduction in both unallocated corporate expense and the effective tax rate, and the benefit of the gain recognized on the Corporation's Inmarsat investment in the second quarter.
 
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook for proposed acquisitions, pending divestitures or unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
 
 
Year-to-Date Results
 
Net sales for the first six months of 2005 were $17.8 billion, a 4% increase over the $17.1 billion recorded in the comparable 2004 period.
 
Net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2005 were $830 million ($1.85 per share) compared to $587 million ($1.31 per share) in 2004. In addition to the Inmarsat gain, the 2005 results include the effects of two previously disclosed unusual items recognized in the first quarter: an after-tax gain of $31 million ($0.07 per share) from the sale of the Corporation's Intelsat investment, and an after-tax loss of $19 million ($0.04 per share) related to an impairment in the value of a telecommunications satellite operated by a subsidiary. On a combined basis, these items increased 2005 net earnings by $39 million ($0.09 per share). No unusual items were recognized in the first half of 2004.
 
Cash Flow and Leverage
 
Cash from operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005 was $697 million and $2.2 billion. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy during the quarter and first half of the year as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 39% at the end of the second quarter, an improvement from 42% at December 31, 2004. At June 30, 2005, the Corporation's cash and short-term investments were $3.5 billion.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S), and Information & Technology Services (I&TS). The results of Electronics, IS&S and I&TS have been aggregated and reported as the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology and systems integration solutions across these segments.
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2004 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment.
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's financial results as determined by GAAP.
 
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results of each business segment for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005 to the same periods in 2004.
 
Systems & IT Group
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 17% for the quarter and 11% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from the 2004 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported sales growth during the quarter and first half of the year.
 
In Electronic Systems, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher sales volume in surface system programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2), in fire control programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) and in platform integration activities at Platform Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS). In IS&S, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume in Information Technology, which offset declines in NASA programs. Information Technology's sales growth includes the impact of the March 31, 2005 acquisition of SYTEX and organic growth on existing and new IT programs.
 
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 27% for the quarter and 21% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 compared to the 2004 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported growth in operating profit during the quarter and first half of the year.
 
In Electronic Systems, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases were mainly due to tactical missile program activities and improved performance in fire control programs at M&FC and volume on surface systems programs at MS2. In IS&S, for both the quarter and first half of the year, the increases were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance
 
activities. In I&TS, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases were due to higher volume in Information Technology and improved performance in Defense Services.
 
Aeronautics
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 8% for the quarter and 6% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from the 2004 periods, due to planned declines in Combat Aircraft, which more than offset growth in Air Mobility. Combat Aircraft sales decreased by $320 million in the quarter and $530 million for the six-month period primarily due to declines in F-16 volume, which more than offset higher F/A-22 volume. Increases in C-130J deliveries contributed to the growth in Air Mobility revenue in each period.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 3% for the quarter and 5% for the six months ended June 30, 2005 from the 2004 periods. Air Mobility operating profit increased for the quarter and year-to-date periods mainly due to profits recognized on C-130J deliveries in 2005. In each period, Combat Aircraft operating profit declined slightly due to lower F-16 volume. In both periods, reduced earnings on the F-35 development program were offset by increased volume and improved performance on F/A-22 and other Combat Aircraft programs.
 
Space Systems
($ millions)
 
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased by 5% for both the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2005 from the 2004 periods. In both periods, sales growth in Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) and Satellites offset declines in Launch Services. The increases in Satellites were primarily due to higher volume on government satellite programs that more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities. There were no
 
commercial satellite deliveries in 2005 compared to one in the second quarter and two in the first six months of 2004. The increases in S&DMS were attributable to the fleet ballistic missile program. In Launch Services, the decreases in sales were mainly due to fewer Atlas launches in the 2005 periods as compared to 2004. There were no Atlas launches in the second quarter and two in the first six months of 2005 compared to two and four launches in the comparable 2004 periods.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 13% for the quarter and 20% for the six months ended June 30, 2005, when compared to the 2004 periods. For the quarter, increases in Launch Services operating profit were partially offset by declines in Satellites. In Satellites, a decrease in commercial satellites was partially offset by higher volume on government satellite programs.
 
For the six-month period, operating profit increased in both Launch Services and Satellites. In Satellites, the increase was due to the impact of higher volume on government satellite programs, which more than offset a decline in commercial satellites.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; performance issues with key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; financial market and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses, and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation or changes in accounting or tax rules, interpretations or pronouncements; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government investigations or audits, and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for government and information technology products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
 
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Lockheed Martin's business, please refer to the Corporation's SEC filings, including the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," "Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements" and "Legal Proceedings" sections of the Corporation's 2004 annual report on Form 10-K, copies of which may be obtained at the Corporation's website: http://www.lockheedmartin.com.
 
It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its earnings, sales and cash outlook by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of July 25, 2005. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
 
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 
The Corporation defines return on invested capital (ROIC) as net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt). The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also plans to use ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes in 2005. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance. The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
