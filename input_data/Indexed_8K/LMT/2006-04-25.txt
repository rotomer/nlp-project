SUMMARY REPORTED RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarters ended March 31, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
REPORTED RESULTS
(In millions, except per share data)
 
OUTLOOK
The following tables and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
2006 OUTLOOK
(In millions, except per share data)
 
 
The increase in projected 2006 diluted earnings per share is driven by operational performance improvements, and a pre-tax gain of approximately $55 million ($36 million after-tax or $0.08 per share) associated with the Corporation's sale of 8.7 million shares of Inmarsat stock during March. Our prior earnings per share outlook had incorporated a pre-tax gain of approximately $72 million ($47 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) associated with the sale of 12.3 million shares of Inmarsat stock during January, and a pre-tax gain of approximately $23 million ($15 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) associated with the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the assets of Space Imaging, LLC, which also occurred in January.
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Net sales for the quarter were $9.2 billion, a 9% increase over the $8.5 billion recorded in the comparable 2005 period.
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $591 million ($1.34 per share). The Corporation adopted FAS 123R "Share-Based Payments" prospectively on January 1, 2006 and recognized stock compensation expense of $30 million ($18 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) for stock options and grants of other stock based incentive awards. The first quarter results also included the two unusual items previously disclosed in our earnings news release issued January 27, 2006. These two unusual items resulted in after-tax gains; $47 million ($0.11 per share) for the Corporation's sale of 12.3 million shares of Inmarsat stock and $15 million ($0.03 per share) from the proceeds received from the sale of the assets of Space Imaging, LLC. Net earnings for the quarter also include an unusual after-tax gain of $36 million ($0.08 per share) for the sale of an additional 8.7 million shares of Inmarsat stock in March. This gain was not included in our prior outlook. On a combined basis, these unusual items increased first quarter 2006 operating profit by $150 million and net earnings by $98 million ($0.22 per share).
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $369 million ($0.83 per share). The first quarter results include an unusual after-tax gain of $31 million ($0.07 per share) for the sale of the Corporation's Intelsat investment and an unusual after-tax loss
 
of $19 million ($0.04 per share) related to an impairment in the value of a telecommunications satellite operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. On a combined basis, these unusual items increased first quarter 2005 operating profit by $17 million and net earnings by $12 million ($0.03 per share).
CASH FLOW AND LEVERAGE
Cash from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $1.2 billion. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy during the first quarter as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 39% at the end of the first quarter; unchanged from the December 31, 2005 level. At March 31, 2006, the Corporation's cash and short-term investments were $3.1 billion.
SEGMENT RESULTS
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments: Electronic Systems; Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S); Information & Technology Services (I&TS); Aeronautics; and Space Systems. The results of Electronic Systems, IS&S and I&TS have been aggregated and reported as the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology and systems integration and engineering solutions across these segments.
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2005 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment.
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics, and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 to the same period in 2005.
Systems & IT Group
($ millions)
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 13% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Each of the business segments in the group reported sales growth during the quarter.
In Electronic Systems, the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volume in air defense programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC); platform integration activities and simulation and training programs at Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS); and tactical systems and undersea systems programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2). In IS&S, the increase was primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, higher volume in Information Technology more than offset lower volume on NASA programs and Defense Services activities.
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 29% for the quarter in 2006 compared to 2005. Each of the business segments in the group reported growth in operating profit during the quarter.
In Electronic Systems, the increase in operating profit was due to improved performance and volume increases in fire control programs and certain international air defense programs at M&FC; simulation and training programs at PT&TS; and radar and tactical systems activities at MS2. In IS&S, the increase was primarily attributable to a higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, the increase was due to improved performance in Defense Services and higher volume in Information Technology, which offset declines due to reduced volume on NASA programs.
 
Aeronautics
($ millions)
Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 from 2005 due to a decline in Air Mobility, which more than offset higher volume in Combat Aircraft. The decline in Air Mobility is primarily attributable to fewer C-130J deliveries. The increase in Combat Aircraft sales was mainly due to higher volume on the F-35 and F-22 programs, which more than offset a decline in F-16 volume.
Segment operating profit increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005 due to increases in both Combat Aircraft and other aeronautics programs, which more than offset declines in Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, higher volume and improved performance on the F-22 program was partially offset by reduced volume on F-16 programs. Improved performance on other aeronautics programs also contributed to the increase in operating profit during the quarter. The decline in Air Mobility operating profit was primarily due to fewer C-130J deliveries and lower volume on other Air Mobility programs.
Space Systems
($ millions)
Net sales for Space Systems increased 18% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The sales growth was primarily attributable to an increase in Satellites and Strategic and Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS). In Satellites, the growth was due to higher volume on both government and commercial programs. There was one commercial satellite delivery in the first quarter of 2006 compared to no deliveries in 2005. In S&DMS, sales increased due to higher volume on both fleet ballistic missile programs and missile defense activities. In Launch Services, sales remained unchanged as increased volume in support of U.S. Government missions on the Atlas program due to the definitization of the EELV Launch Capabilities (ELC) contract was offset by reduced volume from the completion of the Titan program in 2005.
 
Space Systems' operating profit increased by 26% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In Launch Services, operating profit increased due to higher volume and risk reduction activities including the definitization of the ELC contract discussed above and other performance improvements on the Atlas program. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating profit due to the completion of the Titan program in 2005. S&DMS operating profit increased due to higher volume and improved performance on both fleet ballistic missile programs and missile defense activities. Satellites' operating profit remained unchanged, as increased costs on commercial programs offset higher volume and improved performance on government programs.
 
Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs about 135,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. The corporation reported 2005 sales of $37.2 billion.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; return on pension plan assets, interest and discount rates and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; materials availability and performance by key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation or changes in accounting or tax rules or pronouncements; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government investigations or audits, government/regulatory and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for the Corporation's products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Lockheed Martin's business, please refer to the Corporation's SEC filings, including the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
 
and Financial Condition," "Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements" and "Legal Proceedings" sections of the Corporation's 2005 annual report on Form 10-K copies of which may be obtained at the Corporation's website: .

It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its earnings, sales, cash and ROIC outlook by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of April 24, 2006. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also uses ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance.
 
The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders' equity by adding back minimum pension liability values.
