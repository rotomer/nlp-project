EXHIBIT A
The name of the Corporation is Lockheed Martin Corporation.
The period of duration of the Corporation is perpetual.
The purpose for which the Corporation is formed is to engage in any lawful act, activity or business for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized under the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "GCL"). The Corporation shall have all the general powers granted by law to Maryland corporations and all other powers not inconsistent with law which are appropriate to promote and attain its purpose.
The address of the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Maryland is 6801 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20817. The Resident Agent of the Corporation is CSC-Lawyers Incorporating Service Company, whose address is 11 East Chase Street, Baltimore, MD 21202. The Resident Agent is a Maryland corporation.
SECTION 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 2. The number of directors of the Corporation is currently fifteen (15), which number may be increased or decreased from time to time pursuant to the Charter or the Bylaws of the Corporation, but which never shall be less than twelve (12). The names of the current directors who shall act until their successors are duly chosen and qualified, are:
 
SECTION 3. Subject to the terms of any shares of Series Preferred Stock that may be outstanding from time to time, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office as a director or directors at any time, but only for cause, by the affirmative vote at a duly called meeting of stockholders of a majority of the votes which all holders of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation would be entitled to cast at an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class.
SECTION 4. Subject to the terms of any shares of Series Preferred Stock that may be outstanding from time to time, vacancies in the Board of Directors, except for vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the stockholders may be filled by the stockholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs. Subject to the terms of any shares of Series Preferred Stock that may be outstanding from time to time, vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall be filled only by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors. Except to the extent provided in the Charter, no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
SECTION 5. Except to the extent prohibited by law or limited by the Charter, the Board of Directors shall have the power (which, to the extent exercised, shall be exclusive) to fix the number of directors and to establish the rules and procedures that govern the internal affairs of the Board of Directors and nominations for director, including, without limitation, the vote required for any action by the Board of Directors, and that from time to time shall affect the directors' power to manage the business and affairs of the Corporation, and no Bylaw shall be adopted by stockholders which shall modify the foregoing.
The total number of shares of stock of all classes which the Corporation has authority to issue is 1,550,000,000 shares, divided into 50,000,000 shares of Series Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share, and 1,500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share. The aggregate par value of all shares of all classes is $1,550,000,000.00.
 
A description of each class with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualification and terms and conditions of redemption of each class, is as follows:
A. Series Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power from time to time (a) to classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued shares of Series Preferred Stock and (b) to reclassify any unissued shares of any series of Series Preferred Stock, in the case of either (a) or (b) by setting or changing the number of shares constituting such series and the designation, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such shares, and, in such event, the Corporation shall file for record with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland articles supplementary in substance and form as prescribed by the GCL.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall be entitled to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series of Series Preferred Stock subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series.
B. Common Stock
Subject to the rights of holders of shares of any series of Series Preferred Stock established pursuant to Section A of this Article VI, each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder to one vote per share on all matters upon which stockholders are entitled to vote, to receive dividends and other distributions authorized by Board of Directors in accordance with the GCL and to all rights of a stockholder pursuant thereto. The Common Stock shall have no preferences or preemptive, conversion or exchange rights.
C. General
In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under the GCL, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.
 
The following provisions are hereby adopted for the purposes of defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and the directors and stockholders, subject, however, to any provisions, conditions and restrictions hereafter authorized pursuant to Article VI hereof:
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is empowered to authorize the issuance from time to time of shares of its stock of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, and securities convertible into shares of its stock of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration as the Board of Directors may deem advisable, subject to such limitations and restrictions, if any, as may be set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation.
SECTION 2. No holders of shares of stock of the Corporation of any class shall have any preemptive or other right to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class or of securities convertible into stock of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, and whether issued for money, for a consideration other than money or by way of dividend.
SECTION 3. The Board of Directors shall have the power, from time to time, to determine whether any, and if any, what part, of the surplus of the Corporation shall be declared in dividends and paid to the stockholders, and to direct and determine the use and disposition of any such surplus. The Board of Directors may in its discretion use and apply any of such surplus in purchasing or acquiring any of the shares of the stock of the Corporation, or any of its bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, to such extent and in such manner and upon such lawful terms as the Board of Directors shall deem expedient.
SECTION 4. The Corporation reserves the right to adopt, repeal, rescind, alter or amend in any respect any provision contained in this Charter, including but not restricted to, any amendments changing the terms of any class of its stock by classification, reclassification or otherwise, and all rights conferred on stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
SECTION 5. Notwithstanding any provision of law requiring any action to be taken or authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of a designated proportion of the shares of stock of the Corporation, or to be otherwise taken or authorized by vote of the stockholders, such action shall be effective and valid, except as otherwise required by provisions of the Charter, if taken or authorized by the affirmative vote, at a meeting, of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
The Board of Directors shall have the power, at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors (or by action taken pursuant to Article XII), to make and adopt, or to amend, rescind, alter or repeal, any Bylaws of the Corporation. The Bylaws may contain any provision for the regulation and management of the affairs of the Corporation not inconsistent with law or the provisions of the Charter.
 
The Board of Directors shall have power to determine from time to time whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions and regulations the books, records, accounts, and documents of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to inspection by stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Bylaws; and except as so provided no stockholders shall have any rights to inspect any book, record, account or document of the Corporation unless authorized to do so by resolution of the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors in its discretion may allow, in and by the Bylaws of the Corporation or by resolution, the payment of expenses, if any, to directors for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof, and the payment of reasonable compensation to such directors for their services as members of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, and shall fix the basis and conditions upon which such expenses and compensation shall be paid. Any member of the Board of Directors or of a committee thereof, also may serve the Corporation in any other capacity and receive compensation therefor in any form.
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt Bylaws or resolutions for the indemnification of the Corporation's directors, officers, employees and agents, provided that any such Bylaws or resolutions shall be consistent with applicable law.
SECTION 2. To the maximum extent that Maryland law in effect from time to time permits limitation of the liability of directors and officers, no director or officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for money damages. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption or amendment of any provision of the Charter or Bylaws inconsistent with this Article, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding sentence with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if a written consent to such action is
 
signed by all members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
SECTION 1. Any purchase by the Corporation of shares of Voting Stock (as hereinafter defined) from an Interested Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) who has beneficially owned such securities for less than two years prior to the date of such purchase or any agreement in respect thereof, other than pursuant to an offer to the holders of all of the outstanding shares of the same class as those so purchased, at a per share price in excess of the Market Price (as hereinafter defined), at the time of such purchase, of the shares so purchased, shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock not beneficially owned by the Interested Stockholder, voting together as a single class.
