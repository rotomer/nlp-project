Information
For Immediate Release
 
 
 
 
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, July 25, 2006  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported second quarter 2006 net earnings of $580 million ($1.34 per diluted share) compared to $461 million ($1.02 per diluted share) in 2005. Net sales were $10.0 billion, a 7% increase over second quarter 2005 sales of $9.3 billion. Cash from operations for the second quarter of 2006 was $1.6 billion.
Net sales for the first six months of 2006 were $19.2 billion, an 8% increase over the $17.8 billion recorded in the comparable 2005 period. Net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $1.2 billion ($2.68 per share) compared to $830 million ($1.85 per share) in 2005. Cash from operations for the first half of 2006 was $2.8 billion.
"All of our employees continue to focus on meeting customer commitments, capturing new orders, improving productivity and generating cash," said Bob Stevens, Chairman, President and CEO. "Our results reflect excellent operational and financial performance across all business areas. This performance enabled us to increase our 2006 financial outlook, as we drive toward our long standing goal of double-digit operating margins."
 
SUMMARY REPORTED RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended June 30, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
 
The $0.45 increase in projected 2006 diluted earnings per share is primarily driven by improved operational performance in all business segments. In addition, the current outlook reflects a reduction in the projected full-year, weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchase activity and the recognition of an incremental $20 million ($13 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) unusual gain during the second quarter.
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
CASH FLOW AND LEVERAGE
Cash from operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 was $1.6 billion and $2.8 billion. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy during the quarter and first half of the year as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 39% at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the December 31, 2005 level. At June 30, 2006, the Corporation had $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments: Electronic Systems; Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S); Information & Technology Services (I&TS); Aeronautics; and Space Systems. The results of Electronic Systems, IS&S and I&TS have been aggregated and reported as the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology and systems integration and engineering solutions across these segments.
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2005 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment.
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
(In millions)
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 to the same periods in 2005.
Systems & IT Group
($ millions)
 
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 5% for the quarter and 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported sales growth during the quarter and first half of the year.
In Electronic Systems, during the second quarter, sales increased due to higher volume in platform integration activities at Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS) and in surface system programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2). These increases were partially offset by a decline in fire control programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). For the first half of the year, the sales growth in Electronic Systems was due to volume increases in platform integration activities at PT&TS; surface system programs at MS2; and in air defense programs at M&FC. In IS&S, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume in Information Technology, which offset declines in NASA programs.
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 11% for the quarter and 19% for the six months ended June 30, 2006 compared to the 2005 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported growth in operating profit during the quarter and first half of the year.
In Electronic Systems, the increase in operating profit during the second quarter was attributable to improved performance on radar programs at MS2 and higher volume on platform integration activities at PT&TS which were partially offset by a decline in certain tactical missile programs at M&FC. For the six month period, Electronic Systems' operating profit increased mainly due to improved performance on radar programs at MS2 and fire control programs at M&FC as well as higher volume on platform
 
integration activities at PT&TS. In IS&S, for both the quarter and first half of the year, the increases were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities. In I&TS, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases were due to improved performance in Defense Services.
Aeronautics
($ millions)
 
Net sales for Aeronautics decreased by 2% for the quarter and by 3% for the six months ended June 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, sales declined in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. The decrease in Combat Aircraft was due to lower volume on the F-22 and F-16 programs, which was partially offset by an increase in F-35 Lightning II volume. The decline in Air Mobility was mainly due to lower volume on the C-5 program. For the six month period, a decline in Air Mobility sales was partially offset by a slight increase in Combat Aircraft sales. The decline in Air Mobility was attributable to fewer C-130J deliveries and lower volume on the C-5 program. The increase in Combat Aircraft sales was mainly due to higher F-35 volume, partially offset by reduced volume on the F-16 and F-22 programs.
Segment operating profit increased by 7% for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, increases in Air Mobility and other aeronautics programs more than offset a decline in Combat Aircraft. The increase in Air Mobility was mainly due to improved performance on the C-130J and other air mobility programs in 2006. In Combat Aircraft, declines in F-22 operating profit were partially offset by increases due to higher F-35 volume and improved F-16 performance. For the first half of the year, operating profit increased in Air Mobility and other aeronautics programs. Improved performance on C-130 programs accounted for the majority of the increase in Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, operating profit was relatively unchanged between periods. In 2006, higher operating profit on the F-35 program was offset by lower operating profit on the F-22 program. These fluctuations were attributable to the fact that in 2005, operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the F-35 program and increased volume and improved performance on the F-22 program.
 
Space Systems
($ millions)
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased by 29% for the quarter and 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. In both periods, the sales growth was mainly due to volume increases in Satellites and Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS). The increases in Satellites were due to higher volume on both commercial and government programs. There were two commercial satellite deliveries in the second quarter of 2006 and three in the first six months of 2006 compared to no deliveries in the first six months of 2005. The increases in S&DMS were attributable to both the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs. In Launch Services, sales remained relatively unchanged for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods.
Segment operating profit increased by 29% for the quarter and 28% for the six months ended June 30, 2006, when compared to the 2005 periods. For the quarter and six-month period, operating profit increased in Launch Services, Satellites and S&DMS. In Launch Services, operating profit increased due to improved performance on the Atlas program in both 2006 periods due to higher volume and risk reduction activities, including the first quarter definitization of the EELV Launch Capabilities contract. In S&DMS, operating profit increased due to higher volume on the programs discussed above while the increase in Satellites was primarily driven by the increase in commercial satellite deliveries.
 
Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net
($ millions)
 
The FAS/CAS pension adjustment (calculated as the difference between FAS 87 expense and the CAS cost amounts) decreased in 2006 compared to 2005. This decrease is consistent with the Corporation's previously disclosed assumptions used in computing these amounts. For more information see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies."
Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management's evaluation of segment operating performance. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following unusual items were included in "Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net" for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005:
2006 
 
 
 
These items increased our net earnings by $13 million ($0.03 per share) and $111 million ($0.25 per share) during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006.
 
2005 
 
 
 
On a net basis, these items increased our net earnings by $27 million ($0.06 per share) and $39 million ($0.09 per share) during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005.
The Corporation adopted FAS 123(R) "Share-Based Payments" prospectively on January 1, 2006 and recognized stock compensation expense on stock options and grants of other stock based incentive awards during the second quarter of $27 million ($17 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and $57 million ($35 million after-tax or $0.08 per share) for the first six months of 2006.
The increase in "Other, net" is primarily attributable to other corporate activities including an increase in interest income recorded in the 2006 period, resulting mainly from higher cash balances and interest rates.
 
Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs about 135,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. The Corporation reported 2005 sales of $37.2 billion.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; return on pension plan assets, interest and discount rates and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; materials availability and performance by key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation or changes in accounting or tax rules or pronouncements; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government investigations or audits, government/regulatory and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for the Corporation's products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Lockheed Martin's business, please refer to the Corporation's SEC
 
filings, including the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Risk Factors," and "Legal Proceedings" sections of the Corporation's 2005 annual report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained at the Corporation's website: .

It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its earnings, sales, cash and ROIC outlook by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide an outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of July 24, 2006. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also uses ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance.
 
The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders' equity by adding back minimum pension liability balances.
