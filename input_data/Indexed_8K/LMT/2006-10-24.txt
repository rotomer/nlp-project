Information
For Immediate Release
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, October 24, 2006  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported third quarter 2006 net earnings of $629 million ($1.46 per diluted share), compared to $427 million ($0.96 per diluted share) in 2005. Net sales were $9.6 billion, a 4% increase over third quarter 2005 sales of $9.2 billion. Cash from operations for the third quarter of 2006 was $652 million.
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $28.8 billion, a 7% increase over the $27.0 billion in the comparable 2005 period. Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $1.8 billion ($4.12 per share), compared to $1.3 billion ($2.81 per share) in 2005. Cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $3.5 billion.
"Our focus on program execution has driven operational performance to higher levels in each quarter this year, supporting margin expansion, strong growth in our net earnings and a record backlog," said Bob Stevens, Chairman, President and CEO. "This is a tribute to the professionalism of our 140,000 employees who are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers by providing them with the critical capabilities they require."
 
Summary Reported Results and Outlook
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
 
The $0.30 - $0.35 increase in projected 2006 diluted earnings per share is driven by operational improvements, primarily in Aeronautics, and the impact of the following third quarter items that are incremental to our July 2006 projection;
 
 
 
The outlook for 2007 operating profit and earnings per share assumes that the Corporation's 2007 non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be calculated using a discount rate of 6.0%, and the actual return on plan assets in 2006 will be 8.5%. The 2007 non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment and related assumptions will not be finalized until year-end 2006, consistent with the Corporation's pension plan measurement date. The Corporation will update its FAS/CAS pension adjustment, as necessary, when it announces 2006 year-end financial results.
 
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
Cash Flow and Leverage
Cash from operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $652 million and $3.5 billion. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 36% at the end of the third quarter, 3% lower than the December 31, 2005 level. At September 30, 2006, the Corporation had $2.7 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Segment Results
The Corporation operates in five principal business segments: Electronic Systems; Information & Technology Services (I&TS); Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S); Aeronautics; and Space Systems. The results of Electronic Systems, I&TS and IS&S have been aggregated and reported as the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology, systems integration and engineering solutions across these segments.
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2005 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment.
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 to the same periods in 2005.
Systems & IT Group
 
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 10% for the quarter and 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported sales growth during the quarter and the nine-month periods.
Electronic Systems' sales increased due to higher volume in platform integration activities at Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS) and surface system programs at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) for both the quarter and nine-month periods. Sales at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC) increased during the quarter due to tactical missile programs and increased for the nine-month period due to air defense programs. In I&TS, the quarterly sales increase was primarily due to higher volume in Information Technology and Defense Services programs. For the year-to-date period, the increase in sales was attributable to higher volume in both Information Technology and Defense Services, which was partially offset by reduced volume in NASA programs. In IS&S, for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 9% for the quarter and 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the 2005 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported growth in operating profit during the three and nine-month periods.
In Electronic Systems, the increase in operating profit during the third quarter was attributable to improved performance in distribution technology activities at PT&TS, and volume and improved performance on surface systems programs at MS2. For the nine-month period, Electronic Systems' operating profit increased due to higher volume and improved performance on simulation and training activities at PT&TS and improved
 
performance on radar programs at MS2 and fire control programs at M&FC. For both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increases in I&TS were primarily due to higher volume in Information Technology and Defense Services. In IS&S, for both the quarter and nine months, the increases were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
Aeronautics
 
Net sales for Aeronautics decreased as previously projected by 7% for the quarter and by 4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, sales declined in both Air Mobility and Combat Aircraft. The decline in Air Mobility was mainly due to lower volume on the C-130 and C-5 programs. The decrease in Combat Aircraft was due to lower volume on F-16 programs, which was partially offset by increases in F-35 and F-22 volume. For the nine-month period, a decline in Air Mobility sales was partially offset by a slight increase in Combat Aircraft sales. The decline in Air Mobility was attributable to fewer C-130J deliveries and lower volume on the C-5 program. The increase in Combat Aircraft sales was mainly due to higher F-35 volume, partially offset by reduced volume on F-16 programs.
Segment operating profit increased by 22% for the quarter and by 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, operating profit increased in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, operating profit increased due to improved performance on the F-22 and F-16 programs and higher F-35 volume. The increase in Air Mobility was mainly due to improved performance on C-130J sustainment activities in 2006. For the nine-month period, operating profit increased in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. The increase in Combat Aircraft was due to higher operating profit on the F-35 program, which was partially offset by lower operating profit on the F-22 program. These fluctuations were attributable to the fact that in 2005, operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the F-35 program and increased volume and improved performance on the F-22 program. In Air Mobility, the increase was due to improved performance on C-130J sustainment activities.
 
Space Systems
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased by 10% for the quarter and 19% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 from the 2005 periods. For both the quarter and nine-month periods, the sales growth was mainly due to higher volume on both commercial and government satellite programs. There was one commercial satellite delivery in the third quarter of 2006 and four in the nine months of 2006, compared to no deliveries during the comparable 2005 periods. In Launch Services, sales remained relatively unchanged for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. Sales growth in Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) due to higher volume in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs also contributed to the sales increase for the nine-month period.
Segment operating profit increased by 14% for the quarter and 23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, compared to the 2005 periods. For the quarter, operating profit increases in Launch Services were partially offset by a slight decline in Satellites. In Launch Services, the increase was mainly due to the Atlas program, including activities associated with the EELV Launch Capability (ELC) contract. For the nine months, operating profit increased in all three of the segment's lines of business. In Launch Services, the increase was driven by improved performance on the Atlas Program resulting from risk reduction activities, including the first quarter definitization of the ELC contract. In S&DMS, the increase was due to higher volume and improved performance on the programs discussed above, while the growth in Satellites was primarily driven by the increase in commercial satellite deliveries.
 
Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net
 
The FAS/CAS pension adjustment (calculated as the difference between FAS 87 expense and the CAS cost amounts) decreased in 2006 compared to 2005. This decrease is consistent with the Corporation's previously disclosed assumptions used in computing these amounts.
Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management's evaluation of segment operating performance. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following unusual items were included in "Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net" for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005:
2006 
 
 
 
 
 
These items increased our net earnings by $9 million ($0.02 per share) and $120 million ($0.27 per share) during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
 
2005 
 
 
 
On a net basis, these items increased our net earnings by $39 million ($0.09 per share) during the nine months ended September 30, 2005.
The Corporation adopted FAS 123(R) "Share-Based Payments" prospectively on January 1, 2006 and recognized stock compensation expense on stock options and grants of other stock-based incentive awards during the third quarter of $26 million ($17 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and $83 million ($52 million after-tax or $0.12 per share) for year-to-date 2006.
Income Taxes
The Corporation's effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2006 was 23% and reflects a $62 million ($0.14 per share) reduction in income tax expense related to claims filed with the Internal Revenue Service for additional export tax benefits for sales in previous years. This item reduced the effective tax rates for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 by 7.6% and 2.4%, respectively. A similar benefit was not recognized in our prior year results.
 
Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs approximately 140,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. The Corporation reported 2005 sales of $37.2 billion.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; return on pension plan assets, interest and discount rates and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; materials availability and performance by key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation, changes in accounting or tax rules, export policies; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government investigations or audits, government/regulatory and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for the Corporation's products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Lockheed Martin's business, please refer to the Corporation's SEC

It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its financial projections by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide an outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of October 23, 2006. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also uses ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance.
 
The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders' equity by adding back minimum pension liability balances.
