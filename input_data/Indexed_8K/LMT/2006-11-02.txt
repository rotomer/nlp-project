Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Directors at Lockheed Martin Corporation receive annual compensation in the form of a combination of equity and cash. Each director also has the option to defer all cash compensation and be credited with earnings as though the compensation had been invested in common stock. The Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer serves on the Board of Directors but is not separately compensated for his service as a director.
On October 27, 2006, as part of an annual review of director compensation, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the cash compensation to be paid to non-employee directors to $110,000 per annum (from $90,000 per annum previously). The increase is effective November 1, 2006 and will be prorated for the months of November and December 2006. Lockheed Martin pays non-employee directors on a quarterly basis, except that any non-employee director who is elected or who retires at any time of the year will be paid an amount prorated to reflect the portion of the year during which the individual serves as a director.
The Board of Directors also approved an amendment to the Lockheed Martin Directors Equity Plan to provide for the annual grant of equity-based awards with a fair market value on the date of grant of $110,000 (from $90,000 per annum previously). The amendment is effective on January 1, 2007. The Lockheed Martin Directors Equity Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2007, is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
The Board of Directors determined to keep the fees paid to committee chairman at current levels. Effective November 1, 2006, the Chairman of the Classified Business Review Committee will receive an annual retainer of $12,500, which is the same level as the annual retainer paid to the non-employee Chairmen of each of the Board's other standing committees (except for the Audit Committee Chairman). The Chairman of the Audit Committee receives an annual retainer of $20,000. The Corporation pays the committee chairman fees on a quarterly basis.
The Board of Directors also amended the Lockheed Martin Corporation Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, effective October 27, 2006 (the "Deferred Plan"), to allow directors to make or change future contributions to an investment account without requiring that the current balance of the account be transferred from the current investment election. A copy of the Deferred Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report.

Exhibit 10.2
The purpose of this Plan is to give each non-employee Director of Lockheed Martin Corporation the opportunity to be compensated for his or her service as a Director on a deferred basis. The Plan is also intended to establish a method of paying Director's compensation which will aid the Corporation in attracting and retaining as members of the Board persons whose abilities, experience and judgment can contribute to the success of the Corporation. In addition, by providing Directors with the option of accruing earnings based on the performance of Lockheed Martin Common Stock, the Plan is intended to more closely align the economic interests of Directors with the interests of stockholders generally.
The Plan is amended and restated, effective January 1, 2005, in order to comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 409A. This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall apply only to the portion of a Participant's Account Balance that is earned or becomes vested on or after January 1, 2005 (and any earnings attributable to that portion). The portion of a Participant's Account Balance that was earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005 (and any earnings attributable to that portion) shall be governed by the terms of the Plan in effect on December 31, 2004, which is attached hereto as Appendix A.

In the case of a new Director, an election to defer Director's fees must be filed within 30 days after the commencement of the Director's term of office and shall apply only to fees for services after the date of such election. The deferral election shall specify the manner in which earnings (or losses) on the deferred amount shall accrue in accordance with Section 4.2 below.

To the extent that a Director makes an election to have Deferred Compensation credited to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option which is not in compliance with (i) or (ii) above, the amount elected to be deferred into the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option shall initially be allocated to the Interest Option until such time as the allocation to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option would be in compliance with (i) or (ii) above, at which time the deferred amount shall automatically be reallocated.
3.2 . A Director's deferral election for a calendar year shall specify the percentage (which may equal 100%) of the Director's Fees to be earned by the Director for that year which are to be deferred under this Plan and with respect to fees deferred pursuant to that election the interest crediting method selected by the Director in accordance with Article IV and the manner of distribution in accordance with Section 5.1(a). A Director's deferral election shall be irrevocable during any calendar year in which it is in effect. A Director's election shall remain in effect and shall be deemed to have been made for a subsequent calendar year unless the Director files a revised election form by December 31 of the year preceding the year in which the applicable Director's Fees will be earned. If a Director files a change of election in accordance with Section 5.1(c), the manner of distribution elected under that Section will apply only to the Deferred Compensation for the calendar years listed on the Election Form.
Terms of Deferral Elections
4.1 . Director's Fees that a Director has elected to defer shall be credited to the Director's Account as of the first day of the month in which the Director's Fees would have been payable to the Director if no deferral election had been made under this Plan.

Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option.
(d) A combination of (a), (b) and (c).
A Director's initial investment selections must be made by the date that the Director's initial deferral election takes effect. A Director may change his or her investment selections for all amounts credited to the Plan or separately with respect to amounts to be deferred in furture periods to the Director's Account and amounts deferred in prior periods to the Director's Account, provided that any such change to the investment of amounts deferred in prior periods to the Director's Account that would result in an increase or decrease in the portion of the Director's Account allocated to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option shall only be effective if it is made pursuant to an irrevocable written election made at least six months following the date of the Director's most recent "opposite way" election with respect to either the Plan or any other plan maintained by Lockheed Martin that provides for Discretionary Transactions (as defined in Rule 16b-3).

Installment payments shall continue to be made in January of each succeeding year until all installments have been paid.

This emergency distribution amount must take into consideration any amounts by which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or by liquidation of the Director's (or Beneficiary's after the

5.5 . There shall be deducted from all payments under this Plan the amount of taxes, if any, required to be withheld under applicable federal or state tax laws. The Directors and their Beneficiaries will be liable for payment of any and all income or other taxes imposed on Deferred Compensation payable under this Plan.

Plan
3.1 . In order to defer Director's fees earned in any calendar year, a Director must make a deferral election by executing and filing an Election Form before the commencement of that calendar year. In the case of a new Director, an election to defer Director's fees must be filed within 30 days after the commencement of the Director's term of office and shall apply only to fees for services after the date of such election. The deferral election shall specify the manner in which earnings (or losses) on the deferred amount shall accrue in accordance with Section
Timing of Deferral Elections
 
4.2 below. To the extent that a Director elects that any portion of a deferred amount shall accrue earnings based on the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option, such an election shall be given effect only if (i) the election is irrevocably made at least six (6) months prior to the effective date of the allocation or (ii) the crediting of the deferred amount to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option has been approved by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof that is comprised of persons specified in Section 7.1). To the extent that a Director makes an election to have Deferred Compensation credited to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option which is not in compliance with (i) or (ii) above, the amount elected to be deferred into the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option shall initially be allocated to the Interest Option until such time as the allocation to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option would be in compliance with (i) or (ii) above, at which time the deferred amount shall automatically be reallocated.
3.2 . A Director's deferral election for a calendar year shall specify the percentage (which may equal 100%) of the Director's Fees to be earned by the Director for that year which are to be deferred under this Plan and with respect to fees deferred pursuant to that election the interest crediting method selected by the Director in accordance with Article IV and the manner of distribution in accordance with Section 5.1(b). A Director's deferral election shall remain in effect for each subsequent calendar year, unless the Director duly files a revised Election Form or written revocation of the election before the beginning of the subsequent calendar year. A Director's deferral election shall be irrevocable during any calendar year in which it is in effect. If a Director files a change of election in accordance with Section 5.1(d), the manner of distribution elected under that Section will remain in effect for deferrals in any subsequent year unless the Director duly files a revised Election Form.
Terms of Deferral Elections
4.1 . Director's Fees that a Director has elected to defer shall be credited to the Director's Account as of the first day of the month in which the Director's Fees would have been payable to the Director if no deferral election had been made under this Plan. The elected deferral percentage shall apply to all Director's Fees earned by the Director during a calendar year.
Crediting of Director's Fees
4.2 .

Crediting of Investment Earnings

(b) A return (or loss) equal to that of the published index for the Standard & Poors 500 (with dividends) for the month will accrue.
S&P 500 Option.
(c) Earnings (or losses) shall be credited as if such amount had been invested in Lockheed Martin Common Stock at the published closing price of the Corporation's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day preceding the day as to which such amount is deferred (or reallocated) into the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option; this portion of a Director's Account shall reflect any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the market value of Lockheed Martin Common Stock based on the published closing price of the stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month and shall reflect dividends on the stock as if such dividends were reinvested in shares of Lockheed Martin Common Stock.
Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option.
(d) A combination of (a), (b) and (c). A Director's initial investment selections must be made by the date that the Director's initial deferral election takes effect. A Director may change his or her investment selections with respect to all amounts credited to the Director's Account, including amounts deferred in prior periods, provided that any such change that would result in an increase or decrease in the portion of the Director's Account allocated to the Lockheed Martin Common Stock Investment Option shall only be effective if it is made pursuant to an irrevocable written election made at least six months following the date of the Director's most recent "opposite way" election with respect to either the Plan or any other plan maintained by Lockheed Martin that provides for Discretionary Transactions (as defined in Rule 16b-3). Subject to the foregoing, a change of investment selections must be made by filing a revised Election Form in advance of the month in which the change is to take effect.
4.3 . The Deferred Compensation payable to a Director (or the Director's Beneficiary) shall be measured by, and shall in no event exceed, the sum of the amounts credited to the Director's Account.

Manner of Distribution
(a) . Subject to the provisions of Section 5.6 and 5.1(d), with respect to any fees deferred prior to October 24, 2003 a Director's Deferred Compensation shall be paid as a lump sum cash payment equal to the balance credited to the Director's Account on or about January 15
Amounts deferred prior to October 24, 2003

th
of the calendar year that next follows the date of the termination of the Director's status as a Director and continuing over a maximum period of ten (10) years.

Election for Form of Payment
(A) A lump sum.
(B) Annual payments for a period of years designated by the Director which shall not exceed fifteen (15). The amount of each annual payment shall be determined by dividing the Director's Account at the end of the month prior to such payment by the number of years remaining in the elected installment period. The installment period may be shortened, in the sole discretion of the Committee , if the Committee at any time determines that the amount of the annual payments that would be made to the Director during the designated installment period would be too small to justify the maintenance of the Director's Account and the processing of payments.
(c) . A Director may elect to have the Director's Deferred Compensation earned during the 1996 calendar year credited and paid as a lump sum under (a) or annual installments under (b) except that payment (or installments, as the case may be) will be made (or commence) on January 1, 1998, or as soon as practicable thereafter regardless of whether the Director has terminated service as a Director.

(d) . A Director may change any election as to the manner of distribution and file a new election choosing a lump sum or installment payments with respect to the payment of the Director's entire Account, or with respect to fees deferred for specific years or with respect to the specific benefits available under Article VI, by executing an election (on a form prescribed by the Company) within the time periods described in this Section 5.1(d). Any election under this Section 5.1(d) shall specify a time on which commencement of distribution will begin and the number of installments to be paid if any, under the options specified in Section 5.1(b). An election must be made prior to the Director's termination of service as a director. No election will be considered valid to the extent the election would (i) result in a payment being made within six months of the date of the election or (ii) result in a payment in the same calendar year as the election; in the event an election fails to satisfy the provisions set forth in this sentence, the first payment under the election will be delayed until the first January 15 or July 15 that is both (i) at least six months after the date of the election and (ii) in a calendar year after the date of the election.

In the event an election fails to satisfy the terms of this Section 5.1(d), such election shall be void and payment shall commence under the Director's previous valid election or, if none exists, shall be paid in a lump sum.
5.2 . Subject to the provisions of Section 5.6 and except as provided in Sections 5.1(a)and(c) and 5.4, the payment of Deferred Compensation to a Director shall be made following a Director's termination as a Director in accordance with his or her deferral elections regardless of , whether the Director's termination is due to resignation, retirement, disability, death, or otherwise. Installment payments shall continue to be made in January of each succeeding year until all installments have been paid.
