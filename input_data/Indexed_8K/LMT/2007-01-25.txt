Information
For Immediate Release
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, January 25, 2007  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported fourth quarter 2006 net earnings of $729 million ($1.68 per diluted share), compared to $568 million ($1.29 per diluted share) in 2005. Net sales were $10.8 billion, a 6% increase over fourth quarter 2005 sales of $10.2 billion. Cash from operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $333 million.
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.5 billion ($5.80 per share), compared to $1.8 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2005. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $39.6 billion, a 6% increase over the $37.2 billion in the comparable 2005 period. Cash from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $3.8 billion. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 14.5% in 2005.
"Our strategic, operational and financial performance for 2006 was solid and a tribute to our 140,000 employees and our leadership team," said Bob Stevens, Chairman, President and CEO.

Summary Reported Results and Outlook
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarters and years ended December 31, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
 
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
In December 2006, the Corporation completed the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture transaction. As a result, the Corporation's outlook for its 2007 net sales has been updated to reflect the completion of this transaction. The Corporation will no longer record sales on Atlas launch vehicles and related support sold to the U.S. Government as ULA will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the Corporation will recognize its 50% ownership share of ULA's earnings. The Corporation previously disclosed that its 2007 net sales outlook would be reduced by an estimated $800 million upon closure of the ULA transaction.
The Corporation's outlook for its 2007 segment operating profit has been increased to reflect improved performance in its Aeronautics business area.
In addition, the Corporation's outlook for its 2007 non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment has been updated to reflect the:
 
 
 
Cash Flow and Leverage
Cash from operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 was $333 million and $3.8 billion. The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation's ratio of total debt-to-capitalization was 39% at December 31, 2006, unchanged from December 31, 2005. The 2006 ratio includes the impact of the Corporation's adoption of FAS 158, "" (FAS 158). The impact of adoption, together with the required re-measurement of the pension plans, resulted in a $1.9 billion decrease in stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
Segment Results
In January 2007, the Corporation changed the name of its Information & Technology Services business segment to Information Technology & Global Services (IT&GS) to better reflect the nature of operations in this business area. The Corporation operates in four other principal business segments: Electronic Systems; Integrated Systems & Solutions (IS&S); Aeronautics; and Space Systems. The results of Electronic Systems, IT&GS and IS&S have been aggregated and reported as the Systems & IT Group due to the common focus on information technology, systems integration and engineering solutions across these segments.
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net." See our 2005 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment. Schedule "C" of the financial attachments to this release contains the current year values for the various components of "Unallocated corporate (expense) income, net."
 
The following table presents the operating results of the Systems & IT Group, Aeronautics and Space Systems and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
 
 
The following discussion compares the operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 to the same periods in 2005.
Systems & IT Group
 
Net sales for the Systems & IT Group increased by 7% for the quarter and 8% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, sales increases in IT&GS and IS&S more than offset a slight decline in Electronic Systems. Each of the business segments in the group reported sales growth during the year.
Electronic Systems' fourth quarter sales decrease was due to lower volume in distribution technology activities at Platform, Training & Transportation Solutions (PT&TS). During the year, sales increased due to higher volume in platform integration activities at PT&TS, surface systems activities at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2) and air defense programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC). At IT&GS, for both the quarter and the year, increases in sales were mainly due to the impact of organic growth and the purchase of Pacific Architects and Engineers in September 2006. At IS&S, for both the quarter and year, the increases in sales were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
Operating profit for the Systems & IT Group increased by 19% for the quarter and 17% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the 2005 periods. Each of the business segments in the group reported growth in operating profit during the quarter and year.
In Electronic Systems, the increase in operating profit during the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to improved performance in air defense programs at M&FC and surface systems activities at MS2. These increases more than offset lower operating profit in platform integration activities at PT&TS. For the year, Electronic Systems' operating profit increased mainly due to higher volume on surface systems and undersea programs at MS2, air defense programs at M&FC, and improved performance
 
on distribution technology activities at PT&TS. For both the quarter and year, the increases at IT&GS were primarily due to higher volume and improved performance. At IS&S, for both the quarter and year, the increases were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance related to intelligence, defense and information assurance activities.
Aeronautics
 
Net sales for Aeronautics increased by 3% for the quarter and decreased by 2% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter, increased sales in Combat Aircraft more than offset declines in Air Mobility. The increase in Combat Aircraft was due to higher volume on the F-16, F-35 and F-22 programs. The decline in Air Mobility was mainly due to lower volume on various C-130 programs. For the year, a decline in Air Mobility sales was partially offset by an increase in Combat Aircraft sales. The anticipated full-year decline in net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in Air Mobility resulting from fewer C-130J deliveries and lower volume on the C-5 program. The increase in Combat Aircraft sales was mainly due to higher F-35 and F-22 volume, partially offset by reduced volume on F-16 programs.
Segment operating profit increased by 32% for the quarter and by 18% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the 2005 periods. During the quarter and the year, operating profit increased in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility. In Combat Aircraft, the increase in operating profit during the quarter was mainly due to improved performance and higher volume on the F-22 and F-16 programs. The increase for the year was primarily due to higher volume on the F-35 and F-22 programs, and improved performance on F-16 programs. The improvement for the year was also attributable in part to the fact that in 2005, operating profit included a reduction in earnings on the F-35 program. In both periods, the increase in Air Mobility was mainly due to improved performance on C-130J deliveries and sustainment activities in 2006.
 
Space Systems
 
Net sales for Space Systems increased by 8% for the quarter and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the 2005 periods. For both the quarter and year, the sales growth in Satellites was mainly due to higher volume on both government and commercial satellite programs. There was one commercial satellite delivery in the fourth quarter of 2006 and five during the year, compared to no deliveries during the comparable 2005 periods. In Space Transportation, sales declined in both the quarter and year primarily due to lower volume in government space transportation activities on the Titan and External Tank programs. For the year, increased sales on the Atlas Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Launch Capabilities (ELC) contract partially offset the lower government space transportation sales. Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) sales declined in the quarter due to reduced volume on strategic missile programs. During the year, higher volume in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs at S&DMS accounted for the sales increase.
Segment operating profit increased by 21% for the quarter and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the 2005 periods. For the quarter, operating profit increases in Satellites were partially offset by declines in Space Transportation and S&DMS activities. In Satellites, the increase was mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on government satellite activities. In Space Transportation, the decline in operating profit was mainly due to the substantial completion of the Titan program in 2005. For the year, operating profit increased in all three of the segment's lines of business. The growth in Satellites was primarily driven by the volume and performance on government satellite programs and commercial satellite deliveries. The growth in Space Transportation was driven by improved performance on the Atlas program resulting from risk reduction activities, including the first quarter definitization of the ELC contract. In S&DMS, the increase was due to higher volume and improved performance on the programs discussed above.
 
Unallocated Corporate (Expense) Income, Net
 
The FAS/CAS pension adjustment (calculated as the difference between FAS 87 expense and the CAS cost amounts) decreased in 2006 compared to 2005. This decrease is consistent with the Corporation's previously disclosed assumptions used in computing these amounts.
Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management's evaluation of segment operating performance. Therefore, for purposes of segment reporting, the following unusual items were included in "Unallocated Corporate (expense) income, net" for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:
2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These items increased our net earnings by $19 million ($0.04 per share) and $201 million ($0.45 per share) during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.
2005 
 
 
 
 
 
On a net basis, these items increased our net earnings by $74 million ($0.17 per share) and $113 million ($0.25 per share) during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
The Corporation adopted FAS 123(R) "Share-Based Payments" prospectively on January 1, 2006 and recognized stock compensation expense on stock options and grants of other stock-based incentive awards during the fourth quarter of $28 million ($18 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and $111 million ($70 million after-tax or $0.16 per share) for year ended December 31, 2006.
Income Taxes
The Corporation's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 30.5%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 is 29.6% and reflects a $62 million ($0.14 per share) reduction in income tax expense related to claims filed with the Internal Revenue Service for additional export tax benefits for sales in previous years. This item reduced the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 by 1.7%. A similar benefit was not recognized in our prior year results.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; return on pension plan assets, interest and discount rates and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; materials availability and performance by key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation, changes in accounting, tax rules, or export policies; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government/regulatory investigations or audits, and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for the Corporation's products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties

It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its financial projections by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide an outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of January 24, 2007. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also uses ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance.
The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders' equity by adding back minimum pension liability balances.
