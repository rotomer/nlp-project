Information
For Immediate Release
 
BETHESDA, Maryland, April 24, 2007  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported first quarter 2007 net earnings of $690 million ($1.60 per diluted share), compared to $591 million ($1.34 per diluted share) in 2006. Net sales were $9.3 billion, a 1% increase over first quarter 2006 sales of $9.2 billion. Cash from operations for the first quarter of 2007 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 2006.
"Our first quarter earnings reflect our commitment to strong operational and financial performance," said Bob Stevens, Chairman, President and CEO. "We are proud of our capabilities and will continue to deliver on our commitments as we sustain value for our customers, shareholders and employees."
Summary Reported Results and Outlook
The following table presents the Corporation's results for the quarter ended March 31, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporation's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. See the "Forward-Looking Statements" discussion contained in this press release.
 
 
The increase in projected net sales primarily reflects the acquisitions of Management Systems Designers (MSD) and RLM Systems.
The $0.35 - $0.40 per share increase in projected 2007 earnings per share is driven by realized and anticipated operational performance improvements across all business segments (expected to be $0.14 - $0.19 per share) and the benefit of $0.21 per share recognized on unusual items during the first quarter of 2007.
It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook and projections for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or other unusual activities until such transactions have been consummated.
Balanced Cash Deployment Strategy
The Corporation continued to execute its balanced cash deployment strategy during the first quarter as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Results
In February 2007, the Corporation announced a realignment of some of its business segments. The realignment was made to enhance support for critical customer missions and increase the Corporation's integration of resources in areas of solid growth potential. The Corporation combined the Information Technology & Global Services (IT&GS) business segment and the Integrated Systems & Solutions business segment to form the Information Systems & Global Services (IS&GS) business segment, which operates in three lines of business (LOBs): Information Systems, Global Services and Mission Solutions.
 
At the same time, the following additional realignments took place:
 
 
 
The Corporation now operates in four principal business segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; IS&GS; and Space Systems. Schedules "I" through "K" of the attachments to this release present selected historical unaudited pro forma data that has been reclassified to reflect the reorganization.
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporation's business segment operating performance is evaluated, unusual items are excluded from segment results and included in "Unallocated corporate income / (expense), net." See our 2006 Form 10-K for a description of "Unallocated corporate income / (expense), net," including the FAS / CAS pension adjustment. Schedule "C" of the financial attachments to this release contains the current year values for the various components of "Unallocated corporate income / (expense), net."
 
The following table presents the operating results of the four business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporation's consolidated financial results.
 
The following discussion compares the operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 to the same period in 2006.
Aeronautics
 
Net sales for Aeronautics remained unchanged for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 from the 2006 period. Declines in Air Mobility and Combat Aircraft offset increased sales in Other Aeronautics Programs. The decline in Air Mobility was mainly due to lower volume on the C-5 and other air mobility programs. The decrease in Combat Aircraft was mainly due to lower volume on F-22 and F-117 programs, which more than offset increased F-35 volume. The increase in Other Aeronautics Programs was mainly due to higher volume in logistics services activities.
 
Segment operating profit increased by 20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 from the 2006 period. Operating profit increased in both Combat Aircraft and Air Mobility due to improved performance on F-22 and F-16 programs and on C-130 sustainment activities in 2007.
Electronic Systems
 
Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by 3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 from the 2006 period. The increase was primarily due to higher volume in platform integration activities at PT&E and surface systems activities at Maritime Systems & Sensors (MS2). These increases more than offset declines in air defense programs at Missiles & Fire Control (M&FC).
Operating profit for Electronic Systems increased by 4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared to the 2006 period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume and improved performance in platform integration activities at PT&E and undersea and surface systems activities at MS2. These increases more than offset lower operating profit in air defense programs at M&FC.
Information Systems & Global Services
 
Net sales for IS&GS increased by 9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 from the 2006 period. Sales increased in all three of the segment's lines of business. The increase in Information Systems was due to organic growth and the acquisitions of MSD in 2007 and Aspen Systems Corporation in 2006. The increase in Global Services was
 
due to the acquisitions of Pacific Architects and Engineers Inc. and Savi Technology Inc. in 2006.
Operating profit for IS&GS increased by 11% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared to the 2006 period. The increase was primarily due to improved performance in both Mission Solutions and Information Systems.
Space Systems
 
Net sales for Space Systems decreased by 9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 from the 2006 period. The sales decline was expected given the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture and the divestiture of the International Launch Services business in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Corporation no longer records sales on Atlas launch vehicles and related support to the U.S. Government, as ULA is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This sales decline in Space Transportation was partially offset by increases in Strategic & Defensive Missile Systems (S&DMS) and Satellites. S&DMS sales increased due to higher volume in strategic missile programs. At Satellites, higher volume in government satellite activities more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities. There were no commercial satellite deliveries in the first quarter of 2007 compared to one delivery during the comparable 2006 period.
Segment operating profit decreased by 4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared to the 2006 period. Operating profit declines in Space Transportation were partially offset by increases in Satellites and S&DMS activities. In Space Transportation, the decline in operating profit was mainly due to benefits recognized in 2006 from risk reduction activities including the definitization of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Launch Capabilities contract and other performance improvements on the Atlas program. In Satellites, the increase was mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on government satellite activities. The S&DMS growth was primarily driven by higher volume and improved performance on strategic missile programs.
 
Unallocated Corporate Income (Expense), Net
 
The FAS/CAS pension adjustment (calculated as the difference between FAS 87 expense and the CAS cost amounts) decreased in 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease is consistent with the Corporation's previously disclosed assumptions used to compute these amounts.
Certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management's evaluation of segment operating performance. For purposes of segment reporting, the following unusual items were included in "Unallocated Corporate income (expense), net" for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006:
2007 
 
 
These items, along with the income tax benefit of $59 million ($0.14 per share) described below, increased net earnings by $89 million ($0.21 per share) during the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
2006 
 
 
 
On a net basis, these items increased net earnings by $98 million ($0.22 per share) during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were 25.7% and 32.6%. Income tax expense was reduced by $59 million ($0.14 per share) due to the March 2007 completion of an IRS audit, which also reduced the effective tax rate for this quarter by 6.4%. Also reducing the effective tax rate were increased deductions in 2007 for US manufacturing activities and dividends related to our employee stock ownership plan. For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits related to export sales and tax deductions for US manufacturing activities and dividends related to the employee stock ownership plan.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on Lockheed Martin's current expectations and assumptions. Forward-looking statements in this release include estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flow. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: the availability of government funding for our products and services both domestically and internationally; changes in government and customer priorities and requirements (including changes to respond to Department of Defense reviews, Congressional actions, budgetary constraints, cost-cutting initiatives, election cycles, terrorist threats and homeland security); the impact of continued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on funding for existing defense programs; the award or termination of contracts; return on pension plan assets, interest and discount rates and other changes that may impact pension plan assumptions; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries; materials availability and performance by key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; charges from any future impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses and a reduction in the book value of goodwill or other long-term assets; the future impact of legislation, changes in accounting, tax rules, or export policies; the future impact of acquisitions or divestitures, joint ventures or teaming arrangements; the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies (including lawsuits, government/regulatory investigations or audits, and environmental remediation efforts); the competitive environment for the Corporation's products and services; and economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally.
These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties
 
associated with Lockheed Martin's business, please refer to the Corporation's SEC filings, including the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Risk Factors," and "Legal Proceedings" sections of the Corporation's 2006 annual report on Form 10-K, which may be obtained at the Corporation's website: .

It is the Corporation's policy to only update or reconfirm its financial projections by issuing a press release. The Corporation generally plans to provide a forward-looking outlook as part of its quarterly earnings release but reserves the right to provide an outlook at different intervals or to revise its practice in future periods. All information in this release is as of April 23, 2007. Lockheed Martin undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events, actual results or changes in the Corporation's expectations. We also disclaim any duty to comment upon or correct information that may be contained in reports published by investment analysts or others.
NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Corporation believes that reporting ROIC provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively Lockheed Martin uses the capital invested in its operations. The Corporation uses ROIC to evaluate multi-year investment decisions and as a long-term performance measure, and also uses ROIC as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance.
The Corporation calculates ROIC as follows:
Net earnings plus after-tax interest expense divided by average invested capital (stockholders' equity plus debt), after adjusting stockholders' equity by adding back minimum pension liability balances.
