On September 27, 2007, the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin Corporation approved an increase in the base salary of Bruce L. Tanner to $500,000 in connection with his recent promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation. The Board also approved an increase to 75% as the target percentage of base salary that will be considered in calculating Mr. Tanner's annual bonus under the Corporation's Management Incentive Compensation Plan ("MICP"). We calculate MICP bonuses by multiplying an executive's base salary by his or her target percentage, a corporate peformance factor and an individual performance factor, each of which is based on the level of assessed performance against predetermined goals, as described in the Corporation's proxy statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
