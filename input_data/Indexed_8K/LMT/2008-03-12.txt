(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
9. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint or several (including any reasonable investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, provided that legal expenses relate to counsel acceptable to the Company), to which they, or any of them, may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise solely out of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary
 
Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in (i) the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of any Underwriter of Securities expressly for use therein or (ii) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualifications on Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, except statements or omissions in such Form T-1 made in reliance upon information furnished in writing to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Company for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise solely out of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of any Underwriter of Securities expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation of each such Underwriter to indemnify the Company hereunder shall be limited to the total price at which the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder were offered to the public.
(c) Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against any such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party of any such action, suit or proceeding shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as applicable (it being understood that the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability it may have to any indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b); provided, however, that timely notice hereunder to Goldman, Sachs & Co. made pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall be deemed timely notice to any Underwriter that is an indemnifying party). In case any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
 
commencement thereof, such indemnifying party or parties shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it or they shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party or parties to such indemnified party of its or their election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ its counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by such indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (ii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case the indemnifying party or parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iii) the indemnifying party or parties shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. In the event that the indemnified party retains separate counsel pursuant to clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the previous sentence, such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party. Any indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein (other than because such indemnification, by its terms, does not apply), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
 
Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase any Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or
 
other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare and file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Vice President and Treasurer (with a copy, which shall not constitute notice, to the Senior Vice President and General Counsel); , , that any notice to a Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

however
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
18. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
19. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

within the authorization as to aggregate principal amount established from time to time by the Board of Directors and sold in the manner specified in such Opinions of Counsel will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Corporation, entitled to the benefits of this Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and other similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights and to general equitable principles, and to such other qualifications as such counsel shall conclude do not materially affect the rights of Holders of Securities of that series or that are customarily included in similar opinions by lawyers experienced in such matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation shall establish pursuant to Section 2.03 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Corporation shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section, Section 2.02 and the authentication order of the Corporation with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that shall (a) represent and be denominated in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (b) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (c) be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction, and (d) bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of any successor Depositary."
SECTION 2.02. .
Execution and Authentication
Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Corporation by manual or facsimile signature. The Corporation's seal shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities.
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.03 and of the preceding paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time (including, for example, a series constituting a medium-term note program), it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate or the Opinions of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01 or otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraphs at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the time of authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series. In such case the Trustee may conclusively rely on the foregoing documents and opinions delivered pursuant to Section 2.01 and Section 2.03, and this Section, as applicable (unless revoked by superseding comparable documents or opinions), as to the matters set forth therein.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.11 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 2.01 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Corporation, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
If any Security of a series shall be represented by a Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 2.10, the notation of the record owners' interest therein upon original issuance of such Security shall be deemed to be delivered in connection with the original issuance of each beneficial owner's interest in such Global Security.
The Trustee's certificate of authentication on all Securities shall be in substantially the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Corporation to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by an authenticating agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Corporation.
If at any time there shall be an authenticating agent appointed with respect to any series of Securities, then the Trustee's certificate of authentication to be borne by the Securities of each such series shall be substantially as follows:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
SECTION 2.03. .
Title, Amount and Terms of Securities
The principal amount of Securities that may be authenticated and delivered and outstanding under this Indenture is not limited. The Securities may be issued in a total principal amount up to that authorized from time to time by or pursuant to relevant Board Resolutions.
The Securities may be issued in one or more series, each of which shall be issued pursuant to a Board Resolution or Resolutions of the Corporation, which shall specify:
(1) the title of the Securities of that series (which shall distinguish the Securities of that series from Securities of all other series);
(2) any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration or transfer of, in exchange for or in lieu of other Securities of that series pursuant to Sections 2.07, 2.08 or 3.07);
(3) the date or dates (or the manner of determining the same) on which the principal of the Securities of that series is payable (which, if so provided in the Board Resolution or Resolutions, may be determined by the Corporation from time to time and set forth in the Securities of that series issued from time to time);
(4) the rate or rates, or the method to be used in ascertaining the rate or rates, at which the Securities of that series shall bear interest, if any, the basis upon which interest shall be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year of 12 30-day months, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue (which, in either case or both, if so provided in the Board Resolution or Resolutions, may be determined by the Corporation from time to time and set forth in the Securities of that series issued from time to time), the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable (or the manner of determining the same) and the record date for the interest payable on any interest payment date;
(5) if the trustee of that series is other than the Trustee initially named in this Indenture or any successor thereto, the trustee of that series;
(6) the place or places where the principal of and interest, if any, on Securities of that series shall be payable;
(7) the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, the currency or currency unit in which, and the terms and conditions on which Securities of that series may be redeemed or converted into another Security, in whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation;
(8) the obligation, if any, of the Corporation to redeem or purchase Securities of that series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of Holders of Securities of that series (or to convert such Securities into other Securities at
 
the option of the Holder), and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, the currency or currency unit in which, and the terms and conditions upon which Securities of that series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;
(9) if denominated in Dollars and in denominations other than denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000, the denominations in which Securities of that series shall be issuable;
(10) if denominated in other than Dollars, the currency or currencies, including composite currencies, in which the Securities of that series are denominated and the denominations in which Securities of that series shall be issuable;
(11) if the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of that series are to be payable, at the election of the Corporation or a Holder thereof, in a currency or currency unit other than that in which the Securities are denominated or stated to be payable, in accordance with provisions in addition to or in lieu of or in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.13, the period or periods within which (including the Election Date), and the terms and conditions upon which, such election may be made, and the time and manner of determining the exchange rate between the currency or currency unit in which the Securities are denominated or stated to be payable and the currency or currency unit in which the Securities are to be so payable;
(12) the index, if any, used to determine the amount of payments of principal of or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series;
(13) if the amount of payments of the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of that series may be determined with reference to an index based on a currency or currencies other than that in which the Securities of that series are denominated, the manner in which such amounts shall be determined;
(14) if other than the full principal amount, the portion of the principal amount of Securities of that series which shall be payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity pursuant to Section 6.02;
(15) if convertible into or exchangeable for Securities of another series or other securities of the Corporation or another issuer, the terms upon which the Securities of that series will be convertible into or exchangeable for such securities;
(16) the right, if any, of the Corporation to redeem all or any part of the Securities of that series before maturity and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which Securities of that series may be redeemed;

(20) the designation of the original Currency Determination Agent, if any, with respect to the Securities of that series; and
(21) any other terms of or relating to the Securities of that series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture).
All Securities of any particular series shall be identical as to currency of denomination and otherwise shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the relevant Board Resolution or Resolutions.
The Trustee need not authenticate the Securities of any series if their terms impose on the Trustee duties in addition to those imposed on the Trustee by this Indenture. If the Trustee does authenticate any such Securities, the authentication will evidence the Trustee's agreement to comply with any such additional duties.
Each Depositary designated pursuant to this Section for a Global Security in registered form shall, if required, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as a Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation.
SECTION 2.04. .
Registrar and Paying Agent
The Corporation shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Corporation may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. There may be separate Registrars and Paying Agents for different series of Securities.
The Corporation shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Corporation shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such Agent. If the Corporation fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such.
The Corporation initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent.
 
SECTION 2.05. .
Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust
Each Paying Agent for any series of Securities shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders of Securities of the same series or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest, if any, on such Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Corporation in making such payment. If the Corporation or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent with respect to a series of Securities, it shall segregate the money for that series and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Corporation at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon doing so the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money.
SECTION 2.06. .
Securityholder Lists
For each series of Securities, the Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities of that series. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Corporation shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee on or before each interest payment date for each series of Securities and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities of that series.
SECTION 2.07. .
Transfer and Exchange
Where a Security (other than a Global Security, except as set forth herein) is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision) are met. Where Securities (other than a Global Security, except as set forth herein) of any series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations of the same series with identical terms as the Securities exchanged, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. To permit transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. The Corporation may charge a reasonable fee for any transfer or exchange, but not for any exchange pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.07 or 9.05. The Corporation shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of Securities of any series for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities of the same series to be redeemed or before an interest payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
None of the Corporation, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series no longer shall be eligible under Section 2.03, the Corporation shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after the Corporation receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Corporation's election pursuant to Section 2.03(19) no longer shall be effective with respect to the Securities of such series and the Corporation will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Corporation for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Corporation may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities no longer shall be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Corporation will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Corporation for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
If specified by the Corporation pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for the Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Corporation and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Corporation shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver:
(1) to each party specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such party in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such party's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
(2) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
Upon the exchange of the Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the parties in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
SECTION 2.08. .
Replacement Securities
If the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Corporation may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security of the same series with identical terms as the Securities exchanged if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision) are met. Such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Corporation and the Trustee to protect the Corporation, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Corporation and the Trustee may charge for their expenses in replacing a Security.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become due and payable, the Corporation in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security (without surrender thereof, except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Corporation, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them harmless, and in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar, and any agent of any of them, of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Corporation may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses in connection therewith (including all fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar for such Security).
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for any mutilated Security, shall constitute an original additional obligation of the Corporation, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
SECTION 2.09. .
Outstanding Securities
Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee (and, in the case of Global Securities, endorsed by the Trustee) except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Corporation, or an affiliate of the Corporation holds the Security.
 
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the Paying Agent holds on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
If a Security is called for redemption, the Corporation and the Trustee need not treat the Security as outstanding in determining whether Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent.
SECTION 2.10. .
Temporary Securities
Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery or a permanent Global Security or Securities are prepared, as the case may be, the Corporation may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities or one or more temporary Global Securities, as the case may be, of the same series. Temporary Securities of any series shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities or permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, of the same series, but may have variations that the Corporation considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Corporation shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities or a permanent Global Security or Securities, as the case may be, of the same series in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities or permanent Global Securities of such series.
SECTION 2.11. .
Cancellation
The Corporation at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and dispose of all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation, and shall so certify to the Corporation upon its request therefor. The Corporation may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid or it has delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
SECTION 2.12. .
Defaulted Interest
If the Corporation defaults in a payment of interest on any Securities of any series, it shall pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders of those Securities on a subsequent special record date. The Corporation shall fix the special record date and the payment date in respect thereof. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Corporation shall mail to each Holder of Securities of that series a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. The Corporation may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
 
SECTION 2.13. .
Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities
(a) With respect to Securities of any series not permitting the election provided for in subsection (b) below or the Holders of which have not made the election provided for in subsection (b) below, except as provided in subsection (d) below, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Security of such series will be made in the currency or currency unit in which such Security is payable.
(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject to subsections (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of or interest, if any, on such Securities in any of the currencies or currency units that may be designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee for such series of Securities a written election with signature guarantees and in form and substance satisfactory to such Trustee, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive payments in any such currency or currency unit, such election will remain in effect for such Holder until changed by such Holder by written notice to the Trustee for such series of Securities (but any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such change of election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has occurred or notice of redemption has been given by the Corporation pursuant to Article 3). In the event any Holder makes any such election pursuant to the preceding sentence, such election will not be effective on any transferee of such Holder and such transferee shall be paid in the currency or currency unit indicated pursuant to subsection (a) above unless such transferee makes an election pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided, however, that such election, if in effect while funds are on deposit with respect to the Securities of such series as described in Section 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03, will be effective on any transferee of such Holder unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03 for the Securities of such series. Any Holder of any such Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee of such series of Securities not later than the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment date in the relevant currency or currency unit as provided in subsection (a) above. In no case may a Holder of Securities of any series elect to receive payments in any currency or currency unit as described in this subsection following a deposit of funds with respect to the Securities of such series as described in Section 8.01, 8.02 or 8.03.
(c) If the election referred to in subsection (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 2.03, then not later than the fourth Business Day after the Election Date for each payment date for Securities of any series, the Currency Determination Agent for that series will deliver to the Corporation a written notice specifying, in the currency or currency unit in which Securities of such series are payable, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities to be made on such payment date, and specifying the amounts in such currency or currency unit so payable with respect to the Securities of such series as to which the Holders thereof shall have elected to be paid in a currency or currency unit other than that in which such series is denominated as provided in subsection (b) above. If the election referred to in subsection (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 2.03 and if at least one Holder has made such election, then, on the second Business Day preceding such payment
 
date the Corporation will deliver to the Trustee for such series of Securities an Exchange Rate Officers' Certificate with respect to the Dollar, Foreign Currency or currency unit payments to be made on such payment date. The Dollar, Foreign Currency or currency unit amount receivable by Holders of Securities who have elected payment in a currency or currency unit as provided in subsection (b) above shall, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.03, be determined by the Corporation on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the third Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment date.
(d) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency or any currency unit in which any of the Securities are denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant to subsection (b) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of and interest, if any, on the applicable Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency or such currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency or such currency unit was available (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the currency of payment for use on each such payment date. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Corporation to the Trustee of each such series of Securities and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities with respect to such payment date shall be the amount that would have been payable in Foreign Currency or currency units but expressed in Dollars according to the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Currency Determination Agent in the manner provided in subsection (f) or (g) below.
(e) If the Holder of a Security denominated in any currency or currency unit shall have elected to be paid in another currency or currency unit as provided in subsection (b) above, and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected currency or currency unit, such Holder shall receive payment in the currency or currency unit in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election. If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the currency or currency unit in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in subsection (d) above.
(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent payment after the Conversion Date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent and subject to the provisions of subsection (h) below shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.
(h) For purposes of this Section the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "Component Currency" shall mean any currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit.
 
A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were represented in the relevant currency unit on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such amount thereafter shall be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more currencies, each of whose Dollar Equivalent at the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement shall be equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency at the Market Exchange Rate on such date divided by the number of currencies into which such Component Currency was divided, and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the applicable Valuation Date, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
"Election Date" shall mean any date for any series of Securities as specified pursuant to Section 2.03(11) by which the written election referred to in Section 2.13(b) may be made, such date to be not later than the regular record date for the earliest payment for which such election may be effective.
All decisions and determinations of the Currency Determination Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified Amounts as specified above shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Corporation, the Trustee for the applicable series of Securities and all Holders of such Securities denominated or payable in the relevant currency or currency units. The Currency Determination Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Corporation and the Trustee for the applicable series of Securities of any such decision or determination.
In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Corporation, after learning thereof, will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent with respect to such series (and such Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to any currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Corporation, after learning thereof, will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee of the applicable series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent with respect to such series (and such Trustee promptly thereafter will give
 
notice to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event of any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above, the Corporation, after learning thereof, similarly will give written notice to the Trustee of the applicable series of Securities and the Currency Determination Agent.
The Trustee of the applicable series of Securities shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it from the Corporation and the Currency Determination Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
SECTION 2.14. .
Appointment and Resignation of Currency Determination Agent
(a) If and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Corporation will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, a Currency Determination Agent.

Except in the case of a default in payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of such Holders.
SECTION 7.06. .
Reports by Trustee to Holders
If required pursuant to TIA Section 313(a), the Trustee, within 60 days after each May 15, shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with the reporting obligations of TIA Section 313(b).

SECTION 7.07. .
Compensation and Indemnity
The Corporation shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services.

The Corporation shall indemnify the Trustee against any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and its duties hereunder.

The Corporation need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through its own negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct.
To secure the Corporation's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a senior claim to which the Securities are hereby made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of and interest, if any, on particular Securities. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture or the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
SECTION 7.08. .
Replacement of Trustee
The Trustee may resign with respect to the Securities of one or more series by so notifying the Corporation. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to that series by so notifying the removed Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee with the Corporation's consent.

(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of trustee for any reason, the Corporation shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Corporation. Promptly thereafter, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee for the benefit of the series with respect to which it is retiring to the successor Trustee, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall then become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to that series. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Holder of the Securities of the series affected.
If pursuant to Section 2.03(5) a trustee, other than the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto), is appointed with respect to one or more series of Securities, the Corporation, the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto) and such newly appointed trustee shall execute and deliver a supplement to this Indenture which shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto) with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the Trustee is continuing as trustee hereunder shall continue to be vested in the Trustee initially named in this Indenture (or any successor thereto), and shall add to, supplement or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts relating to the separate series of Securities as if it were acting under a separate indenture.
If a successor Trustee with respect to a series of Securities does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Corporation or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder of Securities of that series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If there are two or more Trustees at any time under this Indenture, each will be the Trustee of a separate trust held under this Indenture for the benefit of the series of Securities for which it is acting as Trustee and the rights and obligations of each Trustee will be determined as if it were acting under a separate indenture.

(c) The Corporation may, in the circumstances permitted by the TIA, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series.

1. Interest. Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Corporation"), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semiannually on March 14 and September 14 of each year. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from March 14, 2008. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment. The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next interest payment date even if the Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Corporation may
 
pay principal and interest by its check payable in such money. It may mail an interest check to a Holder's registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, The Bank of New York ("Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
4. Indenture. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of March 11, 2008 ("Indenture"), between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code  77aaa-77bbbb) ("Act"). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Indenture may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal amount.
5. Optional Redemption. The Corporation may redeem all the Notes as a whole or in part, at the Corporation's option, at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes or (b) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date semiannually (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 25 basis points. In either case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes being redeemed. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) will calculate the redemption price.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the Notes on any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for that redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the remaining term of the Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third business day preceding such redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such business day, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Corporation.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary United States Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Corporation shall replace that former dealer with another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer for any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption.
6. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note to be redeemed; provided that the unredeemed portion of the Note shall be $2,000 in principal amount and $1,000 multiples above that amount. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or portions of them called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
 
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and is exchangeable in whole, but not in part, for Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time such Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and, in either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days of the receipt by the Corporation of such notice or of the Corporation becoming aware of such condition, or (ii) the Corporation in its discretion at any time determines not to have all of the Notes represented by one or more Global Security or Securities. If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Notes of like tenor and terms in definitive form in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Note or Notes of the same aggregate denominations to be registered in the name of such Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee, nor any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
9. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provisions of applicable abandoned property law, the money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.
10. Defeasance. The Corporation may defease certain of its obligations with respect to the Notes or discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust, cash or government securities sufficient to pay all sums due on the Notes. The establishment of such a trust will be conditioned on the delivery by the Corporation to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel, who may be counsel to the Corporation, to the effect that, based on applicable U.S. federal income tax law or a ruling published by the United States Internal Revenue Service, the defeasance or discharge, as the case may be, will not be deemed, or result in, a taxable event with respect to the Holders of the Notes.
11. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions as therein provided, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes, and, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as provided in the Indenture, any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented, for among other reasons, to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder. Without the consent of any Holder, the Trustee may waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes if the waiver does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder.
 
12. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture does not limit unsecured debt of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. It does limit certain mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Once a year the Corporation must report to the Trustee on compliance with the limitations.
13. Successors. When a successor entity assumes all the obligations of the Corporation or its successors under the Notes and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
14. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default is: failure to pay the principal on any Note when due; failure for 30 days to pay interest on the Notes when due; failure by the Corporation to comply with any other agreement relating to the Indenture or the Notes for 90 days after the Corporation has been given written notice of such failure; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Corporation, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes, by notice to the Corporation and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of such Holders.
15. Additional Notes. The Corporation may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, create and issue additional debt securities on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes, so that those additional debt securities and the Notes will form a single series of Securities under the Indenture.
16. Trustee Dealings with the Corporation. The Bank of New York, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Corporation or any of its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Corporation or its affiliates as if it were not Trustee.
17. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Corporation under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, with respect to, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
18. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
19. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian) and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
20. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Corporation had caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Note and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to accuracy of any of such numbers either as printed on the Note or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
21. Miscellaneous. This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
The Corporation will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to: Lockheed Martin Corporation, 6801 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, Attention: Secretary.
