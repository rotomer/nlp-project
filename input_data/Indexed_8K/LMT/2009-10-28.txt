On October 23, 2009, Lockheed Martin Corporation's Board of Directors amended the Corporation's bylaws. The bylaws, marked to show changes to the former bylaws, are attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and are incorporated by reference.
.
General
The amendments effect three types of changes to the Corporation's bylaws: the creation of a Lead Director position; the inclusion of the charter for the Classified Business and Security Committee of the Board of Directors (the "CBS Committee"); and other changes related to operation of the Board of Directors and the annual meeting of stockholders.
. The amendments add a new Section 2.05 to the bylaws and create the position of Lead Director. The Lead Director position and its corresponding duties have evolved from and replace those previously provided for the Presiding Director position.
Lead Director
The amendments provide that the Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority of those directors who have been determined to be "independent" for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange requirements, will designate one of the independent directors as the Lead Director. The amendments also provide that the Lead Director will (i) be independent and elected by a majority of the independent directors annually and may be removed from the position by a majority of the independent directors; (ii) preside as Chair at Board of Directors meetings while in executive sessions of the non-management members of the Board of Directors or executive sessions of the independent directors, or when the Chairman of the Board is ill, absent, incapacitated or otherwise unable to carry out the duties of Chairman of Board; (iii) determine the frequency and timing of executive sessions of non-management directors and report to the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer on all relevant matters arising from those sessions, and will invite the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer to join the executive session for further discussion as appropriate; (iv) consult with the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer and committee chairs regarding the topics and schedules of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees; (v) review all Board of Directors and committee agendas and provide input to management on the scope and quality of information sent to the Board of Directors; (vi) assist with recruitment of director candidates and, along with the Chairman of the Board, may extend the invitation to a new potential director to join the Board of Directors; (vii) act as liaison between the Board of Directors and management and among the directors and the committees of the Board of Directors; (viii) serve as member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors; (ix) serve as ex-officio member of each committee if not otherwise a member of the committee; (x) serve as the point of contact for stockholders and others to communicate with the Board of Directors; (xi) recommend to the Board of Directors and committees the retention of advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board of Directors; and (xii) perform all other duties as may be assigned by the Board of Directors from time to time.
In connection with the bylaw amendments, the Board of Directors, by vote of the independent directors, designated James R. Ukropina to serve as the Lead Director. Mr. Ukropina also serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and previously was designated as the Corporation's Presiding Director. The Board of Directors also approved the payment of an annual retainer for the Lead Director of $25,000 per year.
.The amendments add the charter of the CBS Committee as new Section 3.07 to the bylaws. The CBS Committee was formerly called the "Classified Business Review Committee." It initially was formed as a special committee, as opposed to a permanent standing committee, with oversight responsibility for the Corporation's classified business. Its scope has been expanded to include oversight of security of personnel, facilities, and data. The CBS Committee has now been designated a standing committee of the Board of Directors.
Classified Business and Security Committee
The amendments provide that the CBS Committee consists of three (3) or more directors who meet the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and who possess the appropriate security clearance credentials, at least one of whom is a member of the Audit Committee, and all of whom are not officers or employees of the Corporation and are free from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a member of the CBS Committee. The members of the CBS Committee are elected by the Board of Directors to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the amendments, upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors may remove any member of the CBS Committee at any time. Vacancies on the CBS Committee will be filled by the Board of Directors.
The amendments also provide that the purpose of the CBS Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the Corporation's classified business activities and the security of personnel, data and facilities; and that in order to achieve its purpose, the CBS Committee has the following responsibilities:
(i) review with the Corporation's management the strategic, operational and financial aspects of classified business;
(ii) review the policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management and the internal control environment in the area of classified business activities, including discussing with management any major financial risk exposures and the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposure, and in connection with such activities shall have access to the Corporation's internal audit staff and independent auditors, as necessary; and
(iii) review issues and procedures relating to the physical security of the Corporation's facilities and employees and the security of data and information maintained by the Corporation within the Corporation's business or on behalf of its customers.
        As provided in the amendments, in furtherance of its responsibilities, the CBS Committee has the power to investigate any matter falling within its jurisdiction, and will perform such other functions and exercise such other powers as may be delegated to it from time to time by the Board of Directors and will report to the Board of Directors following each meeting of the CBS Committee. As provided in the amendments, such reports to the Board of Directors will, if necessary, be general in nature due to the security requirements involved in discussing detailed business information. The amendments also provide that the CBS Committee will hold at least one meeting per year. Minutes will be maintained in accordance with the classified nature of the material.
As set forth in the amendments, while the CBS Committee has the power and responsibilities set forth in its charter, it is not the responsibility of the CBS Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Corporation's financial statements, as they relate to classified business activities, security issues or security breaches, are complete and accurate and are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As provided in the amendments, this remains the responsibility of management and the independent auditors, and it is not the responsibility of the CBS Committee to assure that the Corporation's classified business activities or procedures relating to the security of personnel or data are in compliance with laws and regulations and the Corporation's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. As provided in the amendments, it is recognized that certain programs may have special or compartmentalized access requirements, with limited availability to obtain such access, and it is not the responsibility or obligation of the CBS Committee to obtain access to information pertaining to such programs.
. The amendments included several administrative and other changes including, among other things, the following items:
