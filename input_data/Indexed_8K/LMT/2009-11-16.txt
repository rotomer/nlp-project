(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
9. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint or several (including any reasonable investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, provided that legal expenses relate to counsel acceptable to the Company), to which they, or any of them, may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise solely out of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in (i) the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of any Underwriter of Securities expressly for use therein or (ii) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualifications on Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, except statements or omissions in such Form T-1 made in reliance upon information furnished in writing to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Company for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise solely out of or are based solely upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
 
omission that was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of any Underwriter of Securities expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation of each such Underwriter to indemnify the Company hereunder shall be limited to the total price at which the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder were offered to the public.
(c) Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against any such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party of any such action, suit or proceeding shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as applicable (it being understood that the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability it may have to any indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b); provided, however, that timely notice hereunder to the Representatives made pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall be deemed timely notice to any Underwriter that is an indemnifying party). In case any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party or parties shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it or they shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party or parties to such indemnified party of its or their election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ its counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by such indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (ii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such action (in which case the indemnifying party or parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iii) the indemnifying party or parties shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. In the event that the indemnified party retains separate counsel pursuant to clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the previous sentence, such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party. Any indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein (other than because such indemnification, by its terms, does not apply), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
 
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase any Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare and file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(d) For purposes of this Section 10, the 2019 Notes and the 2039 Notes shall be treated as two separate series of Securities, and Section 10 shall apply to each series as if this Agreement applied solely to such series.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 (Fax: (212) 816-7912), Attention: General Counsel and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 (Fax: (212) 834-6081), Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Vice President and Treasurer (with a copy, which shall not constitute notice, to the Senior Vice President and General Counsel); , , that any notice to a Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

however
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
18. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
19. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC) ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN DEFINITIVE FORM, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF ANY SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.
1. Interest. Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Corporation"), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from November 18, 2009. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment. The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next interest payment date even if the Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Corporation may pay principal and interest by its check payable in such money. It may mail an interest check to a Holder's registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
 
3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as the Bank of New York) ("Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
4. Indenture. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of March 11, 2008 ("Indenture"), between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code  77aaa-77bbbb) ("Act"). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Indenture may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal amount.
5. Optional Redemption. The Corporation may redeem all the Notes as a whole or in part, at the Corporation's option, at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes or (b) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date semiannually (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points. In either case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes being redeemed. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) will calculate the redemption price.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the Notes on any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for that redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the remaining term of the Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third business day preceding such redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such business day, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer
 
Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Corporation.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary United States Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Corporation shall replace that former dealer with another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer for any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption.
6. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note to be redeemed; provided that the unredeemed portion of the Note shall be $2,000 in principal amount and $1,000 multiples above that amount. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or portions of them called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and is exchangeable in whole, but not in part, for Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time such Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and, in either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days of the receipt by the Corporation of such notice or of the Corporation becoming aware of such
 
condition, or (ii) the Corporation in its discretion at any time determines not to have all of the Notes represented by one or more Global Security or Securities. If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Notes of like tenor and terms in definitive form in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Note or Notes of the same aggregate denominations to be registered in the name of such Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee, nor any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
9. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provisions of applicable abandoned property law, the money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.
10. Defeasance. The Corporation may defease certain of its obligations with respect to the Notes or discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust, cash or government securities sufficient to pay all sums due on the Notes. The establishment of such a trust will be conditioned on the delivery by the Corporation to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel, who may be counsel to the Corporation, to the effect that, based on applicable U.S. federal income tax law or a ruling published by the United States Internal Revenue Service, the defeasance or discharge, as the case may be, will not be deemed, or result in, a taxable event with respect to the Holders of the Notes.
11. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions as therein provided, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes, and, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as provided in the Indenture, any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented, for among other reasons, to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder. Without the consent of any Holder, the Trustee may waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes if the waiver does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder.
12. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture does not limit unsecured debt of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. It does limit certain mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Once a year the Corporation must report to the Trustee on compliance with the limitations.
13. Successors. When a successor entity assumes all the obligations of the Corporation or its successors under the Notes and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations.
 
14. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default is: failure to pay the principal on any Note when due; failure for 30 days to pay interest on the Notes when due; failure by the Corporation to comply with any other agreement relating to the Indenture or the Notes for 90 days after the Corporation has been given written notice of such failure; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Corporation, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes, by notice to the Corporation and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of such Holders.
15. Additional Notes. The Corporation may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, create and issue additional debt securities on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes, so that those additional debt securities and the Notes will form a single series of Securities under the Indenture.
16. Trustee Dealings with the Corporation. The Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Corporation or any of its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Corporation or its affiliates as if it were not Trustee.
17. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Corporation under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, with respect to, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
18. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
19. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian) and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
20. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Corporation had caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Note and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to accuracy of any of such numbers either as printed on the Note or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
21. Miscellaneous. This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The Corporation will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to: Lockheed Martin Corporation, 6801 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, Attention: Secretary.

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC) ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN DEFINITIVE FORM, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF ANY SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.
1. Interest. Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Corporation"), a Maryland corporation, promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Corporation will pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from November 18, 2009. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
2. Method of Payment. The Corporation will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest, which shall be paid as set forth below) to the persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the record date for the next interest payment date even if the Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Corporation, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Corporation will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Corporation may pay principal and interest by its check payable in such money. It may mail an interest check to a Holder's registered address. To the extent lawful, the Corporation shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes and shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate.
 
3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as the Bank of New York) ("Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Corporation may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
4. Indenture. The Corporation issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of March 11, 2008 ("Indenture"), between the Corporation and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code  77aaa-77bbbb) ("Act"). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for a statement of those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Indenture may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal amount.
5. Optional Redemption. The Corporation may redeem all the Notes as a whole or in part, at the Corporation's option, at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes or (b) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date semiannually (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points. In either case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes being redeemed. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) will calculate the redemption price.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the Notes on any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for that redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the remaining term of the Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third business day preceding such redemption date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain such prices on such business day, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Corporation.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary United States Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Corporation shall replace that former dealer with another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer for any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note being redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) on that Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption.
6. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the Note will state the portion of the principal amount of the Note to be redeemed; provided that the unredeemed portion of the Note shall be $2,000 in principal amount and $1,000 multiples above that amount. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or portions of them called for redemption.
7. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and $1,000 multiples above that amount. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Also, it need not transfer or exchange any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or before an interest payment date.
This Note is issued in the form of a Global Security and is exchangeable in whole, but not in part, for Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time such Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and, in either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days of the receipt by the Corporation of such notice or of the Corporation becoming aware of such
 
condition, or (ii) the Corporation in its discretion at any time determines not to have all of the Notes represented by one or more Global Security or Securities. If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Notes of like tenor and terms in definitive form in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Note or Notes of the same aggregate denominations to be registered in the name of such Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary.
8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee, nor any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
9. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory provisions of applicable abandoned property law, the money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation and not to the Trustee for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person.
10. Defeasance. The Corporation may defease certain of its obligations with respect to the Notes or discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust, cash or government securities sufficient to pay all sums due on the Notes. The establishment of such a trust will be conditioned on the delivery by the Corporation to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel, who may be counsel to the Corporation, to the effect that, based on applicable U.S. federal income tax law or a ruling published by the United States Internal Revenue Service, the defeasance or discharge, as the case may be, will not be deemed, or result in, a taxable event with respect to the Holders of the Notes.

Subject to certain exceptions as therein provided, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes, and, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as provided in the Indenture, any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented, for among other reasons, to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

This opinion letter is rendered in connection with the issuance and sale of $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Notes due 2019 and $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Notes due 2039 (collectively, the "Notes"), pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as described in a prospectus supplement dated November 13, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). This opinion letter is furnished to you at your request to enable you to fulfill the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. 229.601(b)(5), in connection with the Registration Statement.

For the purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has all requisite power and authority under all applicable laws, regulations and governing documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture and has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to the Trustee's right to enforce the Indenture against the Corporation, (ii) the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture, (iii) the Trustee is validly existing and in good standing in all necessary jurisdictions, (iv) the Indenture constitutes a valid and binding obligation, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, (v) there has been no mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding or fraud, duress or undue influence in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Indenture, and the conduct of the Trustee has complied with any requirements of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability, and (vi) there are and have been no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is and has been no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Indenture. We also have assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter.
Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized on behalf of the Corporation and that, following (i) receipt by the Corporation of the consideration specified in the Resolutions and (ii) the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Corporation.
In addition to the qualifications, exceptions and limitations elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, our opinions expressed above are subject to the effect of (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory and other law regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers) and (b) the exercise of judicial discretion and the application of principles of equity, good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, conscionability and materiality (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
This opinion letter has been prepared for your use in connection with the filing by the Corporation of a Current Report on Form 8-K on the date hereof, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and speaks as of the date hereof.
