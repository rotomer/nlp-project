Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement which have a special meaning either shall be defined in this Award Agreement or if not defined in this Award Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to the term in the Plan. The term "Target Award" as used in this Award Agreement refers only to the Target Award awarded to you under this Award Agreement and the term "Award" refers only to the Long Term Incentive Performance Award set forth in this Award Agreement. References to the "Corporation" include Lockheed Martin Corporation and its subsidiaries. Appendix A contains an index of all capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement.
Section 1. .
Target Award; Performance Period
1.1 . Your Target Award for the Performance Period under this Award Agreement shall be [Target].
Target Award
1.2 . The Performance Period under this Award Agreement is a three-year performance period that runs from January 1, 2011, until December 31, 2013.
Performance Period
1.3 . The amount payable to you under your Award is dependent upon the Corporation's performance as compared to the metrics described in Section 3 and Section 4 of this Award Agreement and your continued employment with the Corporation in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. As a result of these requirements, any payments you receive may be larger or smaller than your Target Award (., the performance factors could result in no payment in respect of your Award).
Payment of Award
e.g
Section 2. .
Calculation of Award Payments
2.1 . Following the end of the Performance Period and prior to any payments being made,
End of Performance Period Calculation
(a) The Committee will calculate the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor based on the Corporation's performance during the Performance Period relative to the performance of other corporations which compose the "Peer Performance Group" as defined in Section 3.1 below. One-half of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount.
(b) The Committee will also calculate the ROIC Performance Factor based on the Corporation's ROIC during the Performance Period as compared to the projected ROIC for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the ROIC Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the ROIC Performance Amount.
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 3
 
(c) The Committee will also calculate the Cash Flow Performance Factor based on the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period as compared to the projected cumulative Cash Flow in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Cash Flow Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Cash Flow Performance Amount.
(d) Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
(a) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.
Calculation of Average Total Stockholder Return
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 4
 
(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 5
 
(a) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period ("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
ROIC Definition
(b) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
(a) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, Cash Flow means net cash flow from operations but not taking into account: (i) the aggregate difference between the amount forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan to be contributed by the Corporation to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans during the Performance Period and the actual amounts contributed by the Corporation during the Performance Period; or (ii) any tax payments or benefits during the Performance Period associated with the divestiture of business units.
Cash Flow Definition
(b) . Cash Flow shall be determined by the Committee based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the period for which Cash Flow is being determined, the Committee shall determine Cash Flow in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining net cash provided by operating activities as reported in its audited consolidated statement of cash flows, in either case as modified by this paragraph.
Cash Flow Determination
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.

(2) Your employment as an Employee shall be treated as terminating as a result of Divestiture if the Corporation divests all or substantially all of a business operation of the Corporation and such divestiture results in the termination of your employment with the Corporation and a transfer of such employment to the other party in the divestiture. A divestiture shall mean a transaction which results in the transfer of control of the business operation to any person, corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other business entity of which less than 50% of the voting stock or other equity interests are owned or controlled by the Corporation; and

A deferral election form and the terms and conditions for any deferral will be furnished to you in due course. The beneficiary designation for the DMICP (rather than the beneficiary designation for this LTIP Award) shall govern any amounts you elect to defer under the terms of the DMICP.
Further Deferral
5.3. . Any payment called for under Section 5.2 will be reduced to the extent that such payment together with payments attributable to any other Cash-Based Awards that are granted during 2011 as Performance Based Awards exceeds $5,000,000. Amounts in excess of $5,000,000 shall be forfeited.
Cutback

Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 9
 
Section 13, such payment shall be made at the earliest date permitted by Code section 409A. The amount of any delayed payment shall be the amount that would have been paid prior to the delay adjusted to include interest from the original payment date to the actual payment date, at a rate equivalent to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal, plus 25 basis points. The increase over LIBOR may be adjusted to reflect the six month unsecured borrowing rate of the Corporation.
Section 6. .
No Assignment  General Creditor Status
You shall have no right to assign any interest you might have in all or any part of the Target Award or Potential Award which has been granted to you under this Award Agreement and any attempt to do so shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect whatsoever. Furthermore, all payments called for under this Award Agreement shall be made in cash from the Corporation's general assets, and your right to payment from the Corporation's general assets shall be the same as the right of a general and unsecured creditor of the Corporation.
Section 7. .
Plan
This Award Agreement shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
Section 8. .
Change in Control
8.1. . If during the Performance Period, a Change in Control (as defined in Section 7 of the Plan) occurs, the Performance Period will terminate. Notwithstanding any deferral election or term of this Award Agreement to the contrary, a pro rata portion of your Award will be paid to you within fifteen (15) days of the Change in Control. The prorated portion will be the sum of (i) the result obtained by first multiplying your Target Award by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor calculated under Section 3.2(b), but based upon the Total Stockholder Return for the Corporation and the Peer Performance Group as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the Change in Control, and then further multiplying that product by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period.
Change in Control During Performance Period
8.2. . Notwithstanding Section 8.1, if a payment in accordance with those provisions would result in a nonexempt short-swing transaction under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then the date of distribution to you shall be delayed until the earliest date upon which the distribution either would not result in a nonexempt short-swing transaction or would otherwise not result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Section 9. .
Amendment and Termination
As provided in Section 9 of the Plan, the Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan and the Committee may at any time amend this Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by the Board of Directors or the Committee shall amend Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in a manner adverse to you or reduce the amount payable hereunder in a material manner without your written consent. For this purpose, a change in the amount payable hereunder that occurs solely by reason of a change in the date or form of payment shall in no case be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. Thus, for example, if an amount payable by reason of Section 8 is delayed by an amendment to this Award Agreement or other action undertaken to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount payable is reduced solely by reason of a corresponding delay in the date of valuation of a share of the Corporation's common stock, such a change shall not be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. This Section 9 shall be construed and applied so as to permit the Committee to amend this Award Agreement at any time in any manner reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Code section 409A, including amendments regarding the timing and form of payments hereunder.
Section 10. .
No Right to an Award; Value of Award
Your status as an Employee shall not be construed as a commitment that any one or more awards shall be made under the Plan to you or to Employees generally. Your status as a Participant shall not entitle you to any additional award. The value of the Award will not be taken into account for other benefits offered by the Corporation, including but not limited to pension benefits.
Section 11. .
No Assurance of Employment
Nothing contained in the Plan or in this Award Agreement shall confer upon you any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or constitute any contract (of employment or otherwise) or limit in any way the right of the Corporation to change your compensation or other benefits or to terminate your employment with or without cause.
Section 12. .
Conflict
In the event of a conflict between this Award Agreement and the Plan, the Plan document shall control.
Section 13. .
Compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that this Award Agreement constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to which Code section 409A applies, payments under this Award Agreement shall be
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 11
 
made at a time and in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A and guidance of general applicability issued thereunder, including the provisions of 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) to the extent distributions to any specified employee are required to be delayed six months, and all terms shall be interpreted in accordance with Code section 409A.
Section 14. .
Post-Employment Covenants
By accepting this Agreement through the procedure described above, you agree to the terms of the Post-Employment Covenants contained in Exhibit A to this Agreement.
Section 15. .

This Post Employment Conduct Agreement (this "PECA") attached as Exhibit A to the Award Agreement with an Award Date of January 31, 2011 (the "Award Agreement") is entered into in consideration of, among other things, the grant of a Long Term Incentive Performance Award to me under the Award Agreement (the "LTIP") pursuant to the Lockheed Martin Corporation Amended and Restated 2003 Incentive Performance Award Plan, as amended effective January 1, 2009 (the "Plan"). By accepting the LTIP, I agree as follows:

I will not use or disclose or allow the use or disclosure by others to any person or entity, for the purpose or effect of competing unfairly with the Corporation, of Confidential or Proprietary Information of the Corporation or others to which I had access or that I was responsible for creating or overseeing during my employment with the Corporation. In the event I become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or otherwise) to disclose any proprietary or confidential information, I will immediately notify the Corporation's Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary as to the existence of the obligation and will cooperate with any reasonable request by the Corporation for assistance in seeking to protect the information. All materials to which I have had access, or which were furnished or otherwise made available to me in connection with my employment with the Corporation shall be and remain the property of the Corporation. For purposes of this PECA, "Confidential or Proprietary Information" means Proprietary Information within the meaning of CPS 710 (a copy of which has been made available to me), including but not limited to information that a person or entity desires to protect from unauthorized disclosure to third parties that can provide the person or entity with a business, technological, or economic advantage over its competitors, or which, if known or used by third parties or if used by the person's or entity's employees or agents in an unauthorized manner, might be detrimental to the person's or entity's interests.

(b) - Without the express written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, during the two-year period following the Termination Date, I will not induce or attempt to induce any person who is an employee of the Corporation to perform work or services for any entity other than the Corporation.

(d) - Following the Termination Date, I will, to the extent reasonably requested, cooperate with the Corporation in any pending or future litigation (including alternative dispute resolution proceedings) or investigations in which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is a party or is required or requested to provide testimony and regarding which, as a result of my employment with the Corporation, I reasonably could be expected to have knowledge or information relevant to the litigation or investigation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this PECA, nothing in this PECA shall affect my obligation to cooperate with any governmental inquiry or investigation or to give truthful testimony in court.
Cooperation in Litigation and Investigations
2. . I acknowledge and agree that the benefits and compensation opportunities being made available to me under the Award Agreement are in addition to the benefits and compensation opportunities that otherwise are or would be available to me in connection with my employment by the Corporation and that the grant of the LTIP is expressly made contingent upon my agreements with the

Corporation set forth in this PECA. I acknowledge that the scope and duration of the restrictions in Section 1 are necessary to be effective and are fair and reasonable in light of the value of the benefits and compensation opportunities being made available to me under the Award Agreement. I further acknowledge and agree that as a result of the high level executive and management positions I hold with the Corporation and the access to and extensive knowledge of the Corporation's Confidential or Proprietary Information, employees, suppliers and customers, these restrictions are reasonably required for the protection of the Corporation's legitimate business interests.
3. .
Remedies For Breach of Section 1; Additional Remedies of Clawback and Recoupment
(a) If I become (or currently am) an Insider (as defined in the Plan) or receive a Long-Term Incentive Performance Award, I agree, upon demand by the Corporation, to forfeit, return or repay to the Corporation the "Benefits and Proceeds" (as defined below) in the event any of the following occur:
 
 
 
 
(b) The remedy provided in Section 3(a) shall not be the exclusive remedy available to the Corporation for any of the conduct described in Section 3(a) and shall not limit the Corporation from seeking damages or injunctive relief.

deferred; and (ii) to the extent I have not earned the LTIP fully, all of my remaining rights, title or interest in the LTIP.
4. . I acknowledge that the Corporation's remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Corporation against any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of Section 1 or the conduct described in Section 3(a), and, therefore, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the Corporation at law or in equity (including but not limited to, an action under Section 3(a), the Corporation shall be entitled to the granting of injunctive relief in its favor and to specific performance without proof of actual damages and without the requirement of the posting of any bond or similar security.
Injunctive Relief

Accordingly, if any particular provision of this PECA is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this PECA shall be deemed amended to delete the portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of this provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.
Invalidity; Unenforceability

1.2 . The Performance Period under this Award Agreement is a three-year performance period that runs from January 1, 2011, until December 31, 2013.
Performance Period
1.3 . The amount payable to you under your Award is dependent upon the Corporation's performance as compared to the metrics described in Section 3 and Section 4 of this Award Agreement and your continued employment with the Corporation in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. As a result of these requirements, any payments you receive may be larger or smaller than your Target Award (., the performance factors could result in no payment in respect of your Award).
Payment of Award
e.g
Section 2. .
Calculation of Award Payments
2.1 . Following the end of the Performance Period and prior to any payments being made,
End of Performance Period Calculation
(a) The Committee will calculate the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor based on the Corporation's performance during the Performance Period relative to the performance of other corporations which compose the "Peer Performance Group" as defined in Section 3.1 below. One-half of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount.
(b) The Committee will also calculate the ROIC Performance Factor based on the Corporation's ROIC during the Performance Period as compared to the projected ROIC for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the ROIC Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the ROIC Performance Amount.
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 3
 
(c) The Committee will also calculate the Cash Flow Performance Factor based on the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period as compared to the projected cumulative Cash Flow in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Cash Flow Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Cash Flow Performance Amount.
(d) Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
(b) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.
Calculation of Average Total Stockholder Return
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 4
 
(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
(c) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest
ROIC Definition
Award Date: January 31, 2011

marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period ("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
(d) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
 
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.

Section 9. .
Amendment and Termination
As provided in Section 9 of the Plan, the Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan and the Committee may at any time amend this Award Agreement.

For this purpose, a change in the amount payable hereunder that occurs solely by reason of a change in the date or form of payment shall in no case be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. Thus, for example, if an amount payable by reason of Section 8 is delayed by an amendment to this Award Agreement or other action undertaken to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount payable is reduced solely by reason of a corresponding delay in the date of valuation of a share of the Corporation's common stock, such a change shall not be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. This Section 9 shall be construed and applied so as to permit the Committee to amend this Award Agreement at any time in any manner reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Code section 409A, including amendments regarding the timing and form of payments hereunder.

All materials to which I have had access, or which were furnished or otherwise made available to me in connection with my employment with the Corporation shall be and remain the property of the Corporation. For purposes of this PECA, "Confidential or Proprietary Information" means Proprietary Information within the meaning of CPS 710 (a copy of which has been made available to me), including but not limited to information that a person or entity desires to protect from unauthorized disclosure to third parties that can provide the person or entity with a business, technological, or economic advantage over its competitors, or which, if known or used by third parties or if used by the person's or entity's employees or agents in an unauthorized manner, might be detrimental to the person's or entity's interests.

are or would be available to me in connection with my employment by the Corporation and that the grant of the LTIP is expressly made contingent upon my agreements with the Corporation set forth in this PECA. I acknowledge that the scope and duration of the restrictions in Section 1 are necessary to be effective and are fair and reasonable in light of the value of the benefits and compensation opportunities being made available to me under the Award Agreement. I further acknowledge and agree that as a result of the high level executive and management positions I hold with the Corporation and the access to and extensive knowledge of the Corporation's Confidential or Proprietary Information, employees, suppliers and customers, these restrictions are reasonably required for the protection of the Corporation's legitimate business interests.

4. . I acknowledge that the Corporation's remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Corporation against any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of Section 1 or the conduct described in Section 3(a), and, therefore, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the Corporation at law or in equity (including but not limited to, an action under Section 3(a), the Corporation shall be entitled to the granting of injunctive relief in its favor and to specific performance without proof of actual damages and without the requirement of the posting of any bond or similar security.

Section 2. .
Calculation of Award Payments
2.1 . Following the end of the Performance Period and prior to any payments being made,
End of Performance Period Calculation
(a) The Committee will calculate the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor based on the Corporation's performance during the Performance Period relative to the performance of other corporations which compose the "Peer Performance Group" as defined in Section 3.1 below. One-half of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount.
(b) The Committee will also calculate the ROIC Performance Factor based on the Corporation's ROIC during the Performance Period as compared to the projected ROIC for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the ROIC Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the ROIC Performance Amount.
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(c) The Committee will also calculate the Cash Flow Performance Factor based on the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period as compared to the projected cumulative Cash Flow in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Cash Flow Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Cash Flow Performance Amount.
(d) Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
(a) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.
Calculation of Average Total Stockholder Return
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
(a) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest
ROIC Definition
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 5
 
marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period ("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
(b) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
(a) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, Cash Flow means net cash flow from operations but not taking into account: (i) the aggregate difference between the amount forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan to be contributed by the Corporation to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans during the Performance Period and the actual amounts contributed by the Corporation during the Performance Period; or (ii) any tax payments or benefits during the Performance Period associated with the divestiture of business units.
Cash Flow Definition
(b) . Cash Flow shall be determined by the Committee based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the period for which Cash Flow is being determined, the Committee shall determine Cash Flow in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining net cash provided by operating activities as reported in its audited consolidated statement of cash flows, in either case as modified by this paragraph.
Cash Flow Determination
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.

Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by the Board of Directors or the Committee shall amend Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in a manner adverse to you or reduce the amount payable hereunder in a material manner without your written consent. For this purpose, a change in the amount payable hereunder that occurs solely by reason of a change in the date or form of payment shall in no case be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. Thus, for example, if an amount payable by reason of Section 8 is delayed by an amendment to this Award Agreement or other action undertaken to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount payable is reduced solely by reason of a corresponding delay in the date of valuation of a share of the Corporation's common stock, such a change shall not be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. This Section 9 shall be construed and applied so as to permit the Committee to amend this Award Agreement at any time in any manner reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Code section 409A, including amendments regarding the timing and form of payments hereunder.
Section 10. .
No Right to an Award; Value of Award
Your status as an Employee shall not be construed as a commitment that any one or more awards shall be made under the Plan to you or to Employees generally. Your status as a Participant shall not entitle you to any additional award. The value of the Award will not be taken into account for other benefits offered by the Corporation, including but not limited to pension benefits.
Section 11. .
No Assurance of Employment
Nothing contained in the Plan or in this Award Agreement shall confer upon you any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or constitute any contract (of employment or otherwise) or limit in any way the right of the Corporation to change your compensation or other benefits or to terminate your employment with or without cause.
Section 12. .
Conflict
In the event of a conflict between this Award Agreement and the Plan, the Plan document shall control.
Section 13. .
Compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code

(d) Your External Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Factor
(a) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.

(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
(e) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period
ROIC Definition
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 5
 
("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
(f) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
(e) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, Cash Flow means net cash flow from operations but not taking into account: (i) the aggregate difference between the amount forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan to be contributed by the Corporation to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans during the Performance Period and the actual amounts contributed by the Corporation during the Performance Period; or (ii) any tax payments or benefits during the Performance Period associated with the divestiture of business units.
Cash Flow Definition
(f) . Cash Flow shall be determined by the Committee based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the period for which Cash Flow is being determined, the Committee shall determine Cash Flow in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining net cash provided by operating activities as reported in its audited consolidated statement of cash flows, in either case as modified by this paragraph.
Cash Flow Determination
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.

Section 8. .
Change in Control
8.1. . If during the Performance Period, a Change in Control (as defined in Section 7 of the Plan) occurs, the Performance Period will terminate. Notwithstanding any deferral election or term of this Award Agreement to the contrary, a pro rata portion of your Award will be paid to you within fifteen (15) days of the Change in Control. The prorated portion will be the sum of (i) the result obtained by first multiplying your Target Award by the Total Stockholder Return Factor calculated under Section 3.2(b), but based upon the Total Stockholder Return for the Corporation and the Peer Performance Group as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the Change in Control, and then further multiplying that product by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period.

Section 9. .
Amendment and Termination
As provided in Section 9 of the Plan, the Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan and the Committee may at any time amend this Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by the Board of Directors or the Committee shall amend Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in a manner adverse to you or reduce the amount payable hereunder in a material manner without your written consent. For this purpose, a change in the amount payable hereunder that occurs solely by reason of a change in the date or form of payment shall in no case be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. Thus, for example, if an amount payable by reason of Section 8 is delayed by an amendment to this Award Agreement or other action undertaken to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount payable is reduced solely by reason of a corresponding delay in the date of valuation of a share of the Corporation's common stock, such a change shall not be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. This Section 9 shall be construed and applied so as to permit the Committee to amend this Award Agreement at any time in any manner reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Code section 409A, including amendments regarding the timing and form of payments hereunder.

I acknowledge that the scope and duration of the restrictions in Section 1 are necessary to be effective and are fair and reasonable in light of the value of the benefits and compensation opportunities being made available to me under the Award Agreement. I further acknowledge and agree that as a result of the high level executive and management positions I hold with the Corporation and the access to and extensive knowledge of the Corporation's Confidential or Proprietary Information, employees, suppliers and customers, these restrictions are reasonably required for the protection of the Corporation's legitimate business interests.

Calculation of Award Payments
2.1 . Following the end of the Performance Period and prior to any payments being made,
End of Performance Period Calculation
(a) The Committee will calculate the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor based on the Corporation's performance during the Performance Period relative to the performance of other corporations which compose the "Peer Performance Group" as defined in Section 3.1 below. One-half of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount.
(b) The Committee will also calculate the ROIC Performance Factor based on the Corporation's ROIC during the Performance Period as compared to the projected ROIC for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the ROIC Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the ROIC Performance Amount.
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(c) The Committee will also calculate the Cash Flow Performance Factor based on the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period as compared to the projected cumulative Cash Flow in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Cash Flow Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Cash Flow Performance Amount.
(d) Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
(a) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.
Calculation of Average Total Stockholder Return
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
(g) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest
ROIC Definition
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 5
 
marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period ("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
(h) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
(h) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, Cash Flow means net cash flow from operations but not taking into account: (i) the aggregate difference between the amount forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan to be contributed by the Corporation to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans during the Performance Period and the actual amounts contributed by the Corporation during the Performance Period; or (ii) any tax payments or benefits during the Performance Period associated with the divestiture of business units.
Cash Flow Definition
(i) . Cash Flow shall be determined by the Committee based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the period for which Cash Flow is being determined, the Committee shall determine Cash Flow in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining net cash provided by operating activities as reported in its audited consolidated statement of cash flows, in either case as modified by this paragraph.
Cash Flow Determination
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.

Payment Rules
(a) .
General Rule: Vesting; Method of Payment; Timing of Payment
(1) . If you are eligible to receive all, or a portion of, your Potential Award under Section 5.1, up to $5,000,000 dollars of your Potential Award shall be fully vested on the date on which the Committee certifies in writing (for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code) that your Target Award has become a Potential Award for the Performance Period. This portion of your award shall be known as the "Immediate Portion" of your Potential Award. The Immediate Portion of your Potential Award shall be (i) paid to you in cash within ninety (90) days of the certification date described above, but no later than March 15 following such certification date, or (ii) deferred in accordance with Section 5.2(c). Subject to your deferral election under Section 5.2(c), in the event of your death, the Immediate Portion of your Potential Award will be made to your estate if you do not have a properly completed beneficiary designation form on file with the Vice President of Total Rewards and Performance Management.
Immediate Portion
(2) . If your Potential Award exceeds $5,000,000 dollars, the amount in excess of $5,000,000 dollars shall be automatically deferred through December 31, 2014. This portion of your award shall be known as the "Deferred Portion" of your Potential Award. Except as provided in Section 5.2(b)(2), you shall forfeit your right to the payment of the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award if you do not remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2014. The Committee shall establish a bookkeeping account (a "Phantom Stock Account") on your behalf under this Section 5.2(a)(2) and shall credit such account as described in Section 5.2(a)(3) below. Unless you forfeit your right to the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award, you shall receive payment of the value of your Phantom Stock Account in cash as determined as of December 31, 2014, no later than March 15, 2015 (subject to section 5.2(c)). The amount payable under from your Phantom Stock Account shall be determined by multiplying the number of units representing shares of phantom stock credited to your account under Section 5.2(a)(3) by the closing price for a share of the Corporation's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for December 31, 2014, or, if it is not a trading day, on the last trading day before December 31, 2014.
Deferred Portion
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(3) . Your Phantom Stock Account shall be credited with a number of units equal to the number of whole shares (and any fractional share) of the Corporation's common stock which could have been purchased by the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award based on the closing price for a share of the Corporation's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the last trading day of the Performance Period, subject to the Committee's certification in writing (for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code) that your Target Award has become a Potential Award for the Performance Period. Thereafter, the Committee shall make such credits or debits to the units previously credited to such account as the Committee deems appropriate in light of any transaction described in Section 7(a) of the Plan (such as a stock split or stock dividend) or any cash dividends paid on the Corporation's common stock, which dividends shall increase the number of units credited to such account as if such dividends had been reinvested in the Corporation's common stock at the closing price of a share of the Corporation's common stock as reported on The New York Stock Exchange for the last trading day of the quarter in which such dividend is declared by the Board of Directors. Units credited to your Phantom Stock Account are bookkeeping entries only and do not entitle you to any shares of the Corporation's common stock or to any voting or other rights associated with shares of such stock.
Phantom Stock Account
(4) Transactions involving the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award and your Phantom Stock Account under this Award Agreement are subject to the securities laws and CPS 722. Among other things, CPS 722 prohibits employees of the Corporation from engaging in transactions that violate securities laws or involve hedging or pledging stock. Insiders are subject to additional restrictions. The Corporation recommends that Insiders consult with the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary or her staff before entering into any transactions involving the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award or your Phantom Stock Account.

If you terminate employment during the Performance Period but are eligible to receive a portion of your Potential Award as a result of an exception under Section 5.1(b), payment of such portion of your Potential Award shall be in full satisfaction of all rights you have under this Award Agreement; in such circumstances, you will not be eligible for a payment of the Deferred Portion under Section 5.2(a)(2), and no other amounts will be payable to you or on your behalf. The portion of your Potential Award payable to you following a termination of
Termination During Performance Period
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 10
 
employment during the Performance Period under circumstances described in Section 5.1(b) shall be paid to you or, in the event of your death, to your designated beneficiary for the Award, in cash within ninety (90) days after the Committee certifies in writing (for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code) that your Target Award has become a Potential Award for the Performance Period, but no later than March 15, 2013 (subject to section 5.2(c)). In the event of your death and you do not have a properly completed beneficiary designation form on file with the Vice President of Total Rewards and Performance Management's office, your payment will be made to your estate.
(2) . Notwithstanding Section 5.2(a)(2), if your employment terminates after the close of the Performance Period but prior to December 31, 2014, and the Committee determines that your employment terminated under circumstances described in Sections 5.1(b)(1) or (2), then the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award described in Section 5.2(a)(2) shall be paid to you or, in the event of your death, to your designated beneficiary, in cash within ninety (90) days following your termination of employment, but no later than March 15 of the year following your termination of employment (subject to Section 5.2(c)). In the event Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) applies because you are a specified employee receiving a distribution on account of a termination of employment, payment of the Deferred Amount must be delayed for six months from such date. You will be notified if you are a specified employee under Code section 409A. The amount payable in cash under this Section 5.2(b)(2) shall be determined by multiplying the number of units representing shares of phantom stock credited to your account under Section 5.2(a)(3) on the date your termination becomes effective by the closing price for a share of the Corporation's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the date on which your termination becomes effective, or if it is not a trading day, on the last trading day before that date. In the event of your death and you do not have a properly completed beneficiary designation form on file with the Vice President of Total Rewards and Performance Management, your payment will be made to your estate.
Termination After December 31, 2013 and Before December 31, 2014
(c) . You will be given an opportunity to elect to defer any amounts payable under Section 5.2 of this Award Agreement. Such election shall be irrevocable, shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Lockheed Martin Corporation Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan ("DMICP") and the requirements of Code section 409A, and shall be subject to such additional terms and conditions as are set by the Committee. A deferral election form and the terms and conditions for any deferral will be furnished to you in due course. The beneficiary designation for the DMICP (rather than the
Deferral Election

beneficiary designation for this LTIP Award) shall govern any amounts you elect to defer under the terms of the DMICP.
5.3. . Any payment called for under Section 5.2 will be reduced to the extent that such payment together with payments attributable to any other Cash-Based Awards that are granted during 2011 as Performance Based Awards exceeds $5,000,000. Amounts that cannot be paid due to any limitation in the Plan shall be forfeited.
Cutback
5.4. . Any payment made in respect of your Award will be subject to income tax withholding at the minimum rate prescribed by law. You may owe taxes in addition to the amount withheld and may request that tax be withheld at a greater rate. As required under the law, FICA tax will be collected from you or withheld from the amount of your award or from your wages, when any portion of an award becomes vested for tax purposes prior to payment.
Withholding
5.5. . If any payment that would otherwise be made under this Award Agreement is required to be delayed by reason of Section 13, such payment shall be made at the earliest date permitted by Code section 409A. The amount of any delayed payment shall be the amount that would have been paid prior to the delay adjusted to include interest from the original payment date to the actual payment date, at a rate equivalent to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal, plus 25 basis points. The increase over LIBOR may be adjusted to reflect the six month unsecured borrowing rate of the Corporation.
Means of Satisfying Code Section 409A
Section 6. .
No Assignment  General Creditor Status
You shall have no right to assign any interest you might have in all or any part of the Target Award or Potential Award which has been granted to you under this Award Agreement and any attempt to do so shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect whatsoever. Furthermore, all payments called for under this Award Agreement shall be made in cash from the Corporation's general assets, and your right to payment from the Corporation's general assets shall be the same as the right of a general and unsecured creditor of the Corporation.
Section 7. .
Plan
This Award Agreement shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
Section 8. .
Change in Control
8.1. . If during the Performance Period, a Change in Control (as defined in Section 7 of the Plan) occurs, the Performance Period will terminate. Notwithstanding any deferral election or term of this Award Agreement to the contrary, a pro rata portion of your Award will be paid to you within
Change in Control Before December 31, 2014
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 12
 
fifteen (15) days of the Change in Control. The prorated portion will be the sum of (i) the result obtained by first multiplying your Target Award by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor calculated under Section 3.2(b), but based upon the Total Stockholder Return for the Corporation and the Peer Performance Group as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the Change in Control, and then further multiplying that product by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Performance Period. If a Change in Control occurs after the end of the Performance Period but before December 31, 2014, notwithstanding any deferral election or term of this Award Agreement to the contrary, the Deferred Portion of your Potential Award described in Section 5.2(c) will be paid to you within fifteen (15) days of the Change in Control. The amount payable shall be determined by multiplying the number of units representing shares of phantom stock credited to your account under Section 5.2(c)(2) by the closing price for a share of the Corporation's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the date on which the Change in Control occurs, or if it is not a trading day, on the last trading day before that date.
8.2. . Notwithstanding Section 8.1, if a payment in accordance with those provisions would result in a nonexempt short-swing transaction under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then the date of distribution to you shall be delayed until the earliest date upon which the distribution either would not result in a nonexempt short-swing transaction or would otherwise not result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Special Rule
Section 9. .
Amendment and Termination
As provided in Section 9 of the Plan, the Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan and the Committee may at any time amend this Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by the Board of Directors or the Committee shall amend Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in a manner adverse to you or reduce the amount payable hereunder in a material manner without your written consent. For this purpose, a change in the amount payable hereunder that occurs solely by reason of a change in the date or form of payment shall in no case be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. Thus, for example, if an amount payable by reason of Section 8 is delayed by an amendment to this Award Agreement or other action undertaken to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount payable is reduced solely by reason of a corresponding delay in the date of valuation of a share of the Corporation's common stock, such a change shall not be treated as a reduction prohibited by this Section 9. This Section 9 shall be construed and applied so as to permit the Committee to amend this Award Agreement at any time in any manner reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Code section 409A, including amendments regarding the timing and form of payments hereunder.

I will not use or disclose or allow the use or disclosure by others to any person or entity of Confidential or Proprietary Information of the Corporation or others to which I had access or that I was responsible for creating or overseeing during my employment with the Corporation. In the event I become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or otherwise) to disclose any proprietary or confidential information, I will immediately notify the Corporation's Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary as to the existence of the obligation and will cooperate with any reasonable request by the Corporation for assistance in seeking to protect the information.

Section 2. .
Calculation of Award Payments
2.1 . Following the end of the Performance Period and prior to any payments being made,
End of Performance Period Calculation
(a) The Committee will calculate the Total Stockholder Return Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor based on the Corporation's performance during the Performance Period relative to the performance of other corporations which compose the "Peer Performance Group" as defined in Section 3.1 below. One-half of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount.
(b) The Committee will also calculate the ROIC Performance Factor based on the Corporation's ROIC during the Performance Period as compared to the projected ROIC for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the ROIC Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the ROIC Performance Amount.
Award Date: January 31, 2011

(c) The Committee will also calculate the Cash Flow Performance Factor based on the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period as compared to the projected cumulative Cash Flow in the 2011 Long Range Plan as presented at the February 2011 Board meeting. One-quarter of your Target Award will be multiplied by the Cash Flow Performance Factor, with the resulting dollar amount to be known as the Cash Flow Performance Amount.
(d) Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Amount, your ROIC Performance Amount, and your Cash Flow Performance Amount will then be added together, with the sum of those three amounts known as your "Potential Award."
You must (except as specified in Section 5) remain employed by the Corporation through December 31, 2013, to receive your Potential Award.
Section 3. .
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
3.1. . The Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor will be based upon the relative ranking of the Corporation's Average Total Stockholder Return (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) for the Performance Period to the Average Total Stockholder Return for such Period for each corporation in the "Peer Performance Group." The "Peer Performance Group" shall consist of the corporations which compose the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index reported under symbol S5INDU by Bloomberg, L.P. The Corporation's Total Stockholder Return will be based on the performance of its common stock, par value $1.00. The Total Stockholder Return of each corporation that is taken into account in computing the Peer Performance Group Total Stockholder Return will be based on the equity security of the relevant corporation that is used in computing the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index.
Peer Performance Group
3.2. .
Calculation of Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor
(a) . During the Performance Period, the Committee shall compute the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Plan and assuming the reinvestment of any cash dividends) for the Corporation and for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group for thirty-six (36) periods during the Performance Period where each period begins on January 1, 2011 (based on the closing price for the stock on December 31, 2010) and ends on the last day of each successive calendar month in the Performance Period on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. Each such Total Stockholder Return shall be computed from data available to the public. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall average the thirty-six (36) Total Stockholder Return figures for each corporation for the Performance Period to determine each corporation's average Total Stockholder Return ("Average TSR") for the Performance Period. Each corporation's Average TSR shall be ranked among the Average TSR for each other corporation in the Peer Performance Group on a percentile basis.

(b) . Your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor, expressed as a percentage, will be determined under this Section 3.2(b) (and Section 3.2(c) to the extent interpolation is necessary) based on the Percentile Ranking of the Corporation's Average TSR for the Performance Period under the following chart:
Percentage Level of Target Award
 
(c) . If the Corporation's Average TSR puts the Corporation over the listed Percentile Ranking for the applicable Band (other than Band One) in Section 3.2(b), your Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor under Section 3.2(b) shall be interpolated on a linear basis.
Total Stockholder Return Performance Factor Interpolation
Section 4. .
ROIC Performance Factor and Cash Flow Performance Factor
4.1 . The ROIC Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's ROIC for the Performance Period to ROIC as forecasted for the Performance Period in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan and then identifying the ROIC Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the difference on the following table:
ROIC Performance Factor
 
(i) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, "ROIC" means return on invested capital for the Performance Period calculated as (A) average annual (i) net income plus (ii) interest expense times one minus the highest
ROIC Definition
Award Date: January 31, 2011

marginal federal corporate tax rate over the three year Performance Period ("Return"), divided by (B) the average of the four year-end investment balances (beginning with December 31, 2010 year-end balance) consisting of (i) debt (including current maturities of long-term debt) plus (ii) stockholders' equity plus the postretirement plans amounts determined at year-end as included in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity.
(j) . Each component of ROIC and the calculation of any postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and be based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the date or period on which ROIC is being determined, the Committee shall make its determination in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining the components of ROIC and postretirement plans amounts recorded in the Corporation's Statement of Stockholder Equity for purposes of reporting those items on its audited financial statements, as modified by this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ROIC will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any change in accounting standards or adoption of any new accounting standards that is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and that is reported in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. ROIC, as included in the 2011 Long Range Plan, and the change in ROIC for purposes of the ROIC Performance Factor will be determined in accordance with this Section 4.1(b).
ROIC Determination
4.2 . The Cash Flow Performance Factor will be determined by comparing the Corporation's cumulative Cash Flow during the Performance Period to the projected cumulative Cash Flow of the Corporation as forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan, and then identifying the Cash Flow Performance Factor based upon the factor associated with the change from the 2011 Long Range Plan on the following table:
Cash Flow Performance Factor
 
Award Date: January 31, 2011
Page 6
 
(j) . For purposes of this Award Agreement, Cash Flow means net cash flow from operations but not taking into account: (i) the aggregate difference between the amount forecasted in the Corporation's 2011 Long Range Plan to be contributed by the Corporation to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans during the Performance Period and the actual amounts contributed by the Corporation during the Performance Period; or (ii) any tax payments or benefits during the Performance Period associated with the divestiture of business units.
Cash Flow Definition
(k) . Cash Flow shall be determined by the Committee based upon the comparable numbers reported on the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements or, if audited financial statements are not available for the period for which Cash Flow is being determined, the Committee shall determine Cash Flow in a manner consistent with the historical practices used by the Corporation in determining net cash provided by operating activities as reported in its audited consolidated statement of cash flows, in either case as modified by this paragraph.
Cash Flow Determination
4.3 . If the change in ROIC or Cash Flow falls between two numbers listed in the applicable table in Section 4.1 or 4.2, the appropriate factor will be interpolated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ROIC Performance Factor will always be zero if the ROIC for the Performance Period is less than ROIC forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by 45 basis points or more and the Cash Flow Performance Factor will always be zero if the aggregate Cash Flow for the Performance Period is less than what was forecasted for the Performance Period in the 2011 Long Range Plan by more than $0.8 billion.
