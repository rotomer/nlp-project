Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Following the filing of the Company's 2011 proxy statement, we have had a number of conversations with stockholders and other constituencies concerning Lockheed Martin's executive compensation program and the extent to which our Chief Executive Officer's compensation is linked to performance. The Management Development and Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors has reviewed carefully the input of stockholders. Although we believe there is a strong link between pay and performance, the Committee, with our CEO's concurrence, has authorized the amendment of the 287,132 stock options granted to our CEO in January 2011. Under the amendment,
 
 
Any options not forfeited by December 31, 2011 due to a failure to meet one of the performance metrics listed will remain subject to a three-year graded vesting schedule with one-third of the non-forfeited options vesting on each of January 31, 2012, January 31, 2013, and January 31, 2014. All other terms of the 2011 stock option award agreement will remain unchanged.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
