News Release
For Immediate Release
 
 
BETHESDA, Md., April 26, 2011  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported first quarter 2011 net sales of $10.6 billion, compared to $10.3 billion in 2010. Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2011 were $548 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to $519 million, or $1.38 per diluted share in 2010. Cash from operations in the first quarter of 2011 was $1.7 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2010.
The first quarter of 2011 included a FAS/CAS pension adjustment of ($231) million, which reduced earnings from continuing operations by ($150) million, or ($0.43) per share. The first quarter of 2010 included a FAS/CAS pension adjustment of ($110) million, or ($0.19) per share, and an unusual tax charge of ($96) million, or ($0.25) per share resulting from legislation that eliminated the tax deduction for benefit costs reimbursed under Medicare Part D, which together reduced earnings from continuing operations by ($168) million, or ($0.44) per share.
We had a solid operating and financial start to 2011, said Bob Stevens, Chairman and CEO.  We focused on executing on our programs while continuing to find affordable solutions, because we and our customers need to make every dollar count. In this new reality shaped by an increasingly complex global security environment and an uncertain economy, we remain committed to providing value to our customers while achieving strong financial results for our shareholders.

Segment Results
 
The Corporation operates in four principal business segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS); and Space Systems.
Operating profit for the business segments includes equity earnings (losses) from their investments, because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. The Corporations largest equity investments are United Launch Alliance (ULA) and United Space Alliance (USA), both of which are part of Space Systems.
The following table presents the operating results of the four business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporations consolidated financial results.
 
 
In the discussion of comparative results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume and performance.
Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimate of profit at completion for a particular contract.

Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on the Corporations contracts accounted for using the POC method of accounting and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.
 
Aeronautics
 
 
Net sales for Aeronautics increased by $242 million or 8 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The increase primarily was due to higher C-130 volume of approximately $235 million, due to an increase in deliveries (six C-130J deliveries in the first quarter of 2011 compared to three in the first quarter of 2010) and support activities, as well as an increase in volume on the F-35 low-rate initial production (LRIP) work of about $220 million. This increase partially was offset by lower volume of approximately $180 million on the F-22 program, as production continues to wind down with final deliveries expected to be completed in 2012, and lower volume on the F-35 System Development and Demonstration contract of about $85 million as the Corporation continues to transition from development to LRIP work.
Operating profit was unchanged for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The operating margin decrease reflects the changing life cycles of Aeronautics significant programs. Specifically, Aeronautics is performing development and more LRIP work on the F-35 program and is performing less work on the F-22 production program. Development and LRIP contracts typically yield lower profits than mature production programs. Accordingly, while net sales increased in 2011 relative to 2010, operating profit was unchanged and consequently operating margins declined.

Electronic Systems
 
 
Net sales for Electronic Systems increased by $209 million or 6 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The increase primarily was attributable to higher volume on various radar system programs of about $130 million, air defense programs, such as Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), of approximately $90 million, and volume on logistics activities, such as Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services program, of about $90 million. These increases partially were offset by lower volume on ship and aviation systems programs, such as the Persistent Threat Detection System, of about $85 million.
Operating profit for Electronic Systems increased by $38 million or 10 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The increase primarily was attributable to higher operating profit of about $25 million due to higher volume on air defense programs, such as PAC-3, and about $25 million on fire control systems programs, such as Arrowhead, due to the achievement of production milestones.
 
Information Systems & Global Solutions
 
 
Net sales for IS&GS decreased by $85 million or 4 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The volume decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of about $110 million on the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS 2010) program that supported the 2010 United States census.
Operating profit for IS&GS essentially was unchanged from the comparable 2010 period. A decrease in operating profit from the absence of DRIS 2010 in 2011 partially was offset by a higher contribution of operating profit from numerous smaller programs.

Space Systems
 
 
Net sales for Space Systems decreased by $70 million or 4 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. The decrease principally was due to lower volume on the Orion program of about $100 million, and the External Tank program of approximately $35 million as the space shuttle program winds down. Partially offsetting this was an increase of about $80 million due to higher volume in government satellite activities.
Operating profit for Space Systems increased by $10 million or 5 percent for the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable 2010 period. Increased operating profit of about $35 million on government satellites primarily due to achievement of program milestones and volume partially was offset by lower operating profit due to volume on the Orion program and the completion of certain missile defense contracts in 2010. Total equity earnings recognized by Space Systems from ULA and USA represented about $50 million or 23 percent of the segments operating profit in the first quarter of 2011, compared to about $55 million or 26 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin primarily increased due to the impact of lower sales volume and an increase in operating income, as described above.
 
Unallocated Corporate Expense, Net
 
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporations business segment operating performance is evaluated by senior management, certain items are excluded from the business segment results and included in Unallocated corporate expense, net. See the Corporations 2010 Form 10-K for a description of Unallocated corporate expense, net including the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.

Income Taxes
The Corporations effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 30.3 percent for the first quarter of 2011 and 41.0 percent for the comparable 2010 period. The rates for both periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and dividends related to certain of the Corporations defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature. The effective rates for the comparable periods were also impacted by the following items:
 
 
 
In April 2011, the Corporation was notified that the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of the IRS Appeals Divisions resolution of certain adjustments related to tax years 2003-2008.  As a result, the Corporation expects to record a reduction of its income tax expense of approximately $90 million in the second quarter of 2011.
