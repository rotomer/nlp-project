Item 5.02 Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On September 22, 2011, the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin Corporation, acting upon the recommendation of its Management Development and Compensation Committee, decided to discontinue the practice of providing elected officers with tax assistance (, tax gross-ups), effective January 1, 2012, for personal use of corporate aircraft and taxable business association dues. The Corporation plans to continue to provide tax assistance to elected officers for security, relocation assistance, and travel expenses for family members accompanying officers on certain business travel, because the Board believes that these actions have a business purpose and benefit to the Corporation.
i.e.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
