News Release
For Immediate Release
 
 
 
BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 26, 2011  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported third quarter 2011 net sales of $12.1 billion, compared to $11.3 billion in 2010. Earnings from continuing operations during the third quarter of 2011 were $665 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to $557 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in 2010.  Cash from operations during the third quarter of 2011 was $511 million, compared to $513 million during 2010.
Third quarter 2011 results included a special charge of $39 million, which reduced earnings by $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to planned workforce reductions at Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) and Corporate Headquarters. The third quarter of 2010 included a special charge of $178 million related to the Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP), which decreased earnings by $116 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. Consistent with prior periods, third quarter 2011 results also included a FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment of $231 million, which reduced earnings by $143 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to a FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment of $111 million, which reduced earnings by $69 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
Our focus on program execution in support of our customers resulted in a strong third quarter, said Bob Stevens, chairman and chief executive officer.  We continue to take aggressive actions, including painful workforce reductions, to reduce costs and deliver value to our customers and shareholders in this challenging global security and economic reality that we expect will extend into 2012.
 
Summary Reported Results
The following table presents the Corporations results for the periods referenced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):

2011 Financial Outlook
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward- statements, which are based on the Corporations current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments to its outlook for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or special items until such transactions have been consummated. See the Forward-Looking Statements discussion contained in this press release.

Status of F-35 LRIP 5
 
We received customer authorization and initial funding in July 2010 to begin work on low-rate initial production (LRIP) 5. In January 2011, we notified our customer that additional funding would be required to continue the advanced procurement.  Despite not yet receiving such funding, we and our industry team have continued work in an effort to meet our customers desired aircraft delivery dates for the LRIP 5 aircraft.  As a result, as of Sept. 25, 2011, we have approximately $750 million in potential termination liability exposure.  Without additional funding or contract coverage, we estimate that our exposure by the end of 2011 will be approximately $1.2 billion.  We are in the process of negotiating with our customer to obtain additional funding and finalize contract negotiations.

2012 Financial Trends
The Corporations preliminary outlook for 2012 is premised on the U.S. Governments timely approval of 2012 defense budget legislation at a level consistent with the Presidents proposed 2012 defense budget as well as continued support and funding of the Corporation's programs.  If this occurs, the Corporation expects 2012 net sales to be flattish as compared to 2011 levels, and that consolidated 2012 segment operating profit margin will remain at approximately 11 percent. 
 
In addition, the continued decline in discount rates used to measure pension liabilities at year-end could impact 2012 earnings.  If one were to assume a 4.5 percent discount rate at year-end 2011 and the actual investment return for 2011 was 5.0 percent, the effort to harmonize the timing of recovery of pension expense under government cost accounting standards (CAS) with pension funding requirements is not in effect until after 2012, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is potentially reduced from 8.5 percent to 8.0 percent, the Corporation would expect that its 2012 non-cash FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment could be comparable to the 2011 adjustment of approximately $925 million. This estimate for the 2012 FAS/CAS pension adjustment is significantly higher than the Corporation's previous expectations due to the impact of changes in economic factors from those used at year-end 2010 and a delay in the CAS harmonization beyond 2012.  The Corporation will not finalize its postretirement benefit plan assumptions, or determine the actual return on plan assets, until its Dec. 31, 2011 measurement date and they may not be the same as those discussed above.
 
Cash Deployment Activities
 
The Corporation deployed cash in 2011 by:
 
During the third quarter of 2011, the Corporations Board increased the total authorized amount for share repurchases by $3.5 billion, which was approximately the amount available for future repurchases of common stock as of Sept. 25, 2011.
On Sept. 22, 2011, the Corporation increased its quarterly dividend 33 percent, or $0.25 per share. The new quarterly dividend amount will be $1.00 per share, beginning with the payment on Dec. 30, 2011, to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 1, 2011.
 
On Sept. 9, 2011, the Corporation issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million 2.13 percent notes due 2016, $900 million 3.35 percent notes due 2021, and $600 million 4.85 percent notes due 2041. In Oct. 2011, subsequent to the third quarter, the Corporation used a portion of the net proceeds to repay all of its outstanding $500 million 4.12 percent notes due March 2013 as well as to pay a make-whole premium of $26 million for the early redemption of such notes. The make-whole premium will be recognized in "Other non-operating income (expense), net" in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Segment Results
 
The Corporation operates in four principal business segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; IS&GS; and Space Systems.
Operating profit for the business segments includes equity earnings (losses) from their investments because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. The Corporations largest equity investments are United Launch Alliance (ULA) and United Space Alliance (USA), both of which are part of Space Systems.
The following table presents the operating results of the four business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporations consolidated financial results.
 
 
In the discussion of comparative results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume and performance.
 
 
5
 
 
Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimate of profit at completion for a particular contract.
Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on the Corporations contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract. For example, improved conditions typically result from the retirement of risks on contracts. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.
 
Aeronautics
 
 
Net sales in the Aeronautics segment increased $701 million, or 21 percent, during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The increase in net sales primarily was attributable to higher volume of about $495 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (13 C-130J aircraft delivered in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to seven during the same 2010 period) and support activities, approximately $115 million driven by higher volume for the F-35 LRIP program, approximately $135 million for F-16 support activities, and about $100 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (one C-5 aircraft delivered in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to none during the same 2010 period). The increases partially were offset by a decline of about $75 million in net sales due to lower volume on the F-22 program, which will continue to decline as the program winds down with final deliveries expected to be completed in 2012.
 
 
6
 
 
During the first nine months of 2011, net sales in the Aeronautics segment increased $1.2 billion, or 13 percent, as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $825 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (26 C-130J aircraft delivered in the first nine months of 2011 as compared to 16 during the same 2010 period) and support activities, approximately $500 million due to an increase in volume for work performed on the F-35 LRIP program, about $235 million for F-16 support activities, and approximately $205 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (two C-5 aircraft delivered in the first nine months of 2011 as compared to none during the same 2010 period). These increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $435 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program, and lower net sales of about $105 million for the F-35 SDD program.
Operating profit in the Aeronautics segment increased $58 million, or 15 percent, during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The primary contributors to the growth were an increase of about $55 million on the F-22 program due to risk retirements in 2011 and approximately $55 million for C-130 programs as a result of higher volume and the retirement of risks in 2011, partially offset by a decline of approximately $40 million in operating profit for the F-16 program due to risk retirements in 2010.
During the first nine months of 2011, operating profit in the Aeronautics segment increased $88 million, or 8 percent, as compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to approximately $95 million of higher operating profit on C-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks in 2011, and about $70 million due to risk retirements on other Aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011.  These increases partially were offset by lower operating profit of approximately $60 million on several programs (F-35, F-16 and other combat aircraft and other Aeronautics programs) due to risk retirements in 2010.
Aeronautics operating margins are declining in 2011 as compared to those reported over the last few years due to the changing life cycle of significant Aeronautics programs. Specifically, Aeronautics sales are being driven by a larger share of LRIP activities on the F-35 production and C-5 modernization programs with less volume on the F-22 and F-16 production programs. LRIP contracts typically yield lower margins than more mature production programs.

Electronic Systems
 
 
Net sales in the Electronic Systems segment increased $77 million, or 2 percent, during the third quarter and $542 million, or 5 percent, during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. Contributing to the increases were higher volume on air defense programs (including Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)) of approximately $125 million during the third quarter and about $330 million during the first nine months of 2011. Additional volume for logistics activities related to the Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services program, which began late in the third quarter of 2010, increased sales by about $105 million during the third quarter and approximately $295 million during the first nine months of 2011. Increased deliveries on tactical missiles programs (including Hellfire) resulted in increased net sales of approximately $95 million during the third quarter and about $175 million during the first nine months of 2011. Higher volume on the Littoral Combat Ship program contributed to an increase in net sales of approximately $65 million for the third quarter and about $115 million for the first nine months of 2011. The net sales increase during the first nine months of 2011 also was attributable to higher volume on various radar system programs of about $115 million.
These increases partially were offset by a decline in volume on other ship and aviation systems programs (primarily the 2010 deliveries of Persistent Threat Detection Systems) of about $195 million during the third quarter and approximately $340 million during the first nine months of 2011, lower volume on various other training and logistics services programs of approximately $65 million during the third quarter and about $135 million during the first nine months of 2011, and declines in volume on fire control systems of about $40 million for the third quarter and approximately $60 million for the first nine months of 2011.

During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, operating profit in the Electronic Systems segment increased $16 million, or 4 percent, and $96 million, or 8 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. Operating profit increased about $40 million during the third quarter and approximately $50 million during the first nine months of 2011 on tactical missiles programs (including Hellfire and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) due to volume and the retirement of risks, and about $20 million during the third quarter and about $15 million during the first nine months of 2011 for various training and logistics services programs, partially offset by decreases in operating profit of about $30 million and approximately $50 million on ship and aviation systems programs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively. Additionally, the operating profit increase during the first nine months of 2011 was attributable to radar system programs and undersea warfare programs of approximately $35 million due to volume and air defense programs (PAC-3) of about $40 million due to volume and risk retirements.
 
Information Systems & Global Solutions
 
 
Net sales in the IS&GS segment decreased $202 million, or 8 percent, during the third quarter and $448 million, or 6 percent, during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The decreases primarily were attributable to lower volume of about $150 million during the third quarter and approximately $500 million during the first nine months of 2011 due to the absence of the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program that supported the 2010 United States census.
Operating profit in the IS&GS segment during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 essentially was unchanged as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. A decrease in operating profit for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 from the absence of the DRIS program in 2011 was offset by higher operating profit from numerous smaller programs, including about $25 million during the third quarter and about $40 million for the first nine months of 2011 from the retirement of risks on several programs, including Transportation Worker Identification Credential and Automated Flight Service Station.
 
9
 
 
Space Systems
 
 
Net sales in the Space Systems segment increased $200 million, or 10 percent, during the third quarter and $61 million, or 1 percent, during the first nine months of 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The increases in net sales were attributable to increased volume of about $145 million during the third quarter primarily related to commercial satellites (one delivery in the third quarter of 2011 and none in the same 2010 period), approximately $250 million during the first nine months due to commercial satellites and government satellite activities, and higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about $45 million during the third quarter and approximately $70 million during the first nine months of 2011. These increases partially were offset by declines of about $25 million for the third quarter and approximately $85 million for the first nine months of 2011 related to the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the space shuttle program in July 2011. Additionally, changes in volume on the NASA Orion program increased net sales by about $35 million during the third quarter of 2011, but decreased net sales by approximately $150 million during the first nine months of 2011.
During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, operating profit in the Space Systems segment increased $15 million, or 6 percent, and $42 million, or 6 percent, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The increases in operating profit principally were attributable to volume and retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about $35 million for the third quarter and approximately $75 million for the first nine months of 2011.  Operating profit also increased about $15 million during the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to defensive missile systems.  Partially offsetting this increase was lower equity earnings from ULA and USA of about $40 million for the third quarter and approximately $30 million for the first nine months of 2011 as compared to 2010.
 
 
10
 
 
Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented about $35 million, or 15 percent, and approximately $165 million, or 23 percent, of the segments operating profit during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.  During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented about $75 million, or 33 percent, and approximately $195 million, or 28 percent, respectively.
 
Unallocated Corporate Expense, Net
 
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporations business segment operating performance is evaluated by senior management, certain items are excluded from the business segment results and are included in Unallocated corporate expense, net. See the Corporations 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Unallocated corporate expense, net including the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
 
During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, the Corporation recorded severance charges totaling $39 million and $136 million, net of state tax benefits. The severance charges recorded in the third quarter of 2011 related to the IS&GS business segment and Corporate Headquarters.  In the second quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded severance charges totaling $97 million, net of state tax benefits, of which $49 million and $48 million related to the Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, respectively.  These charges reduced net earnings in the third quarter by $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, and for the first nine months by $88 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions.  Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments based on years of service, which are expected to be paid through the first half of 2012.
 
11
 
These severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and Corporate Headquarters activities to better align the organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions.  The workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles, where several of the Corporation's major programs are transitioning out of development and into production, and certain programs are ending.
In the third quarter of 2010, the Corporation recorded a severance charge of $178 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the VESP.  The charge, which included lump-sum special payments for qualifying executives, reduced net earnings by $116 million ($0.32 per diluted share for the third quarter and $0.31 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010).
The Corporation expects to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges, including the severance related to the VESP, in future periods through the pricing of the Corporation's products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers.  While the VESP is expected to be recovered over several years, the other severance charges would typically be expected to be recovered within a one year period.  For example, Space Systems recovered about half of its second quarter 2011 severance charge in the third quarter of 2011, which largely was offset by about a $15 million charge related to excess inventory.
Income Taxes
The Corporations effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 29.9 percent and 26.1 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, and 32.8 percent and 34.1 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and dividends related to certain of the Corporations defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.  The effective tax rates for the comparable periods were also impacted by the following items:
During the second quarter of 2011, the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completed its review of the Internal Revenue Service Appeals Divisions resolution of certain adjustments related to tax years 2003-2008. As a result, the Corporation recorded a reduction of its income tax expense of $89 million through the elimination of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits during the second quarter of 2011.
 
12
 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, tax legislation retroactively extended the research and development (R&D) tax credit for two years, from Jan. 1, 2010 to Dec. 31, 2011. The Corporation recognized R&D tax credits of $11 million and $28 million as a reduction of income tax expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively. R&D tax credits were not recognized during the corresponding periods in 2010 as the credit was not reinstated until later in 2010.
 
During the first quarter of 2010, health care legislation eliminated the tax deduction for company-paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. As a result, the Corporation recorded additional income tax expense of $96 million during the first nine months of 2010.
