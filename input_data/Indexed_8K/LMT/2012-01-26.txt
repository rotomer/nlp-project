News Release
For Immediate Release
 
 
BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 26, 2012  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported fourth quarter 2011 net sales of $12.2 billion compared to $12.8 billion in 2010. Earnings from continuing operations during the fourth quarter of 2011 was $698 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to $821 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, in 2010.
Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 reflect an increase in the FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment, which reduced earnings by $66 million, or $0.20 per diluted share compared to 2010, a decrease in Research and Development (R&D) tax credits, which reduced earnings by $36 million, or $0.11 per diluted share compared to 2010, and premiums on the early extinguishments of debt, which reduced earnings by $28 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.  During the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010, earnings from continuing operations also included a charge related to facilities consolidation within the Electronic Systems business segment, which reduced earnings by $27 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.
 
Cash from operations during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 was $1.1 billion, after making accelerated contributions of $1.0 billion to the pension trust. Cash from operations during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010 was $210 million, after making accelerated contributions of $840 million to the pension trust.
 
Our continued focus on executing our customers programs domestically and internationally resulted in a strong year with a record backlog, said Bob Stevens, chairman and chief executive officer.  We will need to remain agile in 2012 given the uncertainties ahead, but I am confident that our workforce and diversified portfolio will enable us to continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.

Segment Results
The Corporation operates in four principal business segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS); and Space Systems.
During the quarter ended Sept. 25, 2011, the Corporation disclosed plans to divest Savi Technology, Inc. (Savi), a logistics business within the Electronic Systems business segment.  Additionally, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, the Corporation realigned an immaterial supply chain services business from the Aeronautics business segment to the Electronic Systems business segment.  The segment results and discussions that follow exclude Savi from Electronic Systems as discontinued operations and also reflect the realignment of the supply chain services business between the Aeronautics and Electronic Systems business segments.

Operating profit for the business segments includes equity earnings (losses) from their investments because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. The Corporations equity investments include United Launch Alliance (ULA) and United Space Alliance (USA), both of which are part of Space Systems.  The following table presents the operating results of the four business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporations consolidated financial results.
 
 
In the discussion of comparative results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume and performance.
 
Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimate of profit at completion for a particular contract.
Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on the Corporations contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract. For example, improved conditions typically result from the retirement of risks on contracts. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.

Aeronautics
 
 
Net sales in the Aeronautics segment increased $25 million, or 1 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The increase in net sales primarily was attributable to higher volume of about $355 million for the F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) program as production increases and approximately $205 million for F-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries (five F-16 aircraft delivered in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 compared to three during the same 2010 period). The increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $240 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program, which will continue to decline as production winds down with final deliveries expected to be completed in 2012, about $115 million for lower volume on C-5 programs (no C-5M aircraft delivered in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 compared to one during the same 2010 period), lower volume of about $80 million for C-130 programs primarily due to a decrease in deliveries (seven C-130J aircraft delivered in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 compared to nine during the same 2010 period), lower volume of about $50 million on the F-35 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program as development work decreased, and about $50 million for lower volume on other programs.
Net sales in the Aeronautics segment increased $1.3 billion, or 10 percent during the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $850 million for work performed on the F-35 LRIP program as production increases, higher volume of about $745 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (33 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010) and support activities, about $425 million for F-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries (22 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010), and approximately $90 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (two C-5M aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010). These increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $675 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program and lower net sales of about $155 million for the F-35 SDD program as development work decreased.

Operating profit in the Aeronautics segment increased $47 million, or 11 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The primary contributors to the growth were an increase of about $70 million on F-16 programs due to volume and risk retirements in 2011 and approximately $35 million for C-130 and C-5 programs as a result of risk retirements. These increases partially were offset by a decline of approximately $60 million in operating profit for the F-22 program due to lower volume and risk retirements compared to 2010.  Operating profit for the F-35 program during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 was comparable to the corresponding period in 2010.
Operating profit in the Aeronautics segment increased $132 million, or 9 percent, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to approximately $115 million of higher operating profit on C-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks, increased volume and risk retirements on F-16 programs of about $50 million and C-5 programs of approximately $20 million, and about $70 million due to risk retirements on other Aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011.  These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on the F-22 and F-35 SDD programs primarily due to lower volume and about $55 million on other programs, including F-35 LRIP, primarily due to lower risk retirements in 2011, compared to 2010.

Electronic Systems
 
 
Net sales in the Electronic Systems segment decreased $314 million, or 8 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  The decrease was driven by fewer deliveries on tactical missile programs (including Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and Hellfire programs) of approximately $205 million, and declines in volume on certain ship and aviation programs (primarily Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA)) of $60 million, undersea warfare programs of about $60 million, surface naval warfare programs (including Aegis) of approximately $50 million, and various logistics and training services and other programs of about $80 million.  These decreases partially were offset by higher volume on air defense programs (including Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) of approximately $90 million and about $50 million related to the Littoral Combat Ship program.
During the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, net sales in the Electronic Systems segment increased $223 million, or 2 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  The increase was due to higher volume on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) of about $420 million, logistics activities of about $330 million related to the Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services program, which began late in the quarter ended Sept. 26, 2010, and the Littoral Combat Ship program of approximately $165 million.  These increases partially were offset by a decline in volume of approximately $375 million for certain ship and aviation programs (primarily MPA and Persistent Threat Detection Systems), about $200 million for various logistics and training services, and approximately $115 million for tactical missile and fire control programs.

Operating profit in the Electronic Systems segment decreased $59 million, or 12 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  Operating profit decreased by about $45 million on tactical missile programs (primarily JASSM) due to declines in volume and lower risk retirements in 2011, approximately $35 million for lower volume related to various logistics and other programs, and about $55 million for contract cost recovery matters on various ship and aviation programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). The decline in operating profit partially was offset by approximately $20 million for higher volume and retirement of risks on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD), and approximately $60 million from the successful collection of certain platform integration program receivables that were previously reserved.
During the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, operating profit in the Electronic Systems segment increased $40 million, or 2 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  Operating profit increased by about $60 million due to higher volume and retirement of risks on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) and approximately $35 million primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea warfare programs in 2010.  These increases partially were offset by approximately $55 million for contract cost recovery matters on various ship and aviation programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program).
 
Information Systems & Global Solutions
 
 
The IS&GS business segment was affected by the fiscal pressures constraining government purchases of information technology (IT) and other products and services during 2011. The Corporation expects that continued budget pressure in the government IT market will contribute to lower sales in 2012, compared to 2011.  The Corporation also expects that IS&GS annual operating margins in 2012 will be comparable to annual 2011 operating margins.
Net sales in the IS&GS segment decreased $92 million, or 3 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 and $540 million, or 5 percent, during the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding periods in 2010. The decreases primarily were attributable to lower volume of about $120 million during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 and approximately $665 million during the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 due to the absence of the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program that supported the 2010 United States census and a decline in activities on the Airborne Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program.  These decreases partially were offset by increased net sales on numerous programs.

Operating profit in the IS&GS segment increased $55 million, or 28 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 and $60 million, or 7 percent, during the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding periods in 2010.  Operating profit increased about $75 million during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 and approximately $180 million for the year due to volume and the retirement of risks in 2011 and the absence of reserves recognized in 2010 on numerous programs (including among others, the NASA Outsourcing Desktop Initiative (about $60 million for both periods) and Transportation Worker Identification Credential and Automated Flight Service Station programs for the year).  The increases in operating profit in both periods partially were offset by the absence of the DRIS program and a decline in activities on the JTRS program of about $15 million and $120 million for the respective periods.
 
Space Systems
 
 
Net sales in the Space Systems segment decreased $169 million, or 7 percent, during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  The decrease in net sales was attributable to decreased volume of about $230 million related to government and commercial satellite activities (no commercial satellites deliveries in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 compared to one during the same 2010 period), partially offset by increased volume of about $55 million on the NASA Orion program.
Net sales in the Space Systems segment decreased $108 million, or 1 percent, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to the corresponding period in 2010.  The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of about $90 million related to the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the space shuttle program in July 2011, a decline in volume of about $90 million related to the NASA Orion program, and lower volume of approximately $30 million related to government satellites.  These decreases partially were offset by higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about $80 million and commercial satellites of approximately $45 million (one commercial satellite delivery in both 2011 and 2010).
 
 
10
 
 
During the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, operating profit in the Space Systems segment decreased $21 million, or 8 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The decrease in operating profit principally was attributable to decreased volume and lower profit rate adjustments compared to 2010 on government and commercial satellite activities of about $25 million.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, operating profit in the Space Systems segment increased $21 million, or 2 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. The increase in operating profit principally was attributable to retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about $60 million and increased equity earnings from ULA of about $20 million, partially offset by lower equity earnings from USA of about $50 million due to the completion of the space shuttle program.
Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented about $60 million, or 23 percent, and approximately $230 million, or 23 percent, of this segments operating profit during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2011, respectively. During the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2010, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented about $65 million, or 23 percent, and approximately $260 million, or 27 percent, respectively, of this segments operating profit.

Unallocated Corporate Expense, Net
 
 
Consistent with the manner in which the Corporations business segment operating performance is evaluated by senior management, certain items are excluded from the business segment results and are included in Unallocated corporate expense, net. See the Corporations 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Unallocated corporate expense, net including the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
Consistent with prior periods, results for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011 included a FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment of $230 million, which reduced earnings by $142 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to a FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment of $123 million, which reduced earnings by $76 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010.
During the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, the Corporation recorded severance charges totaling $136 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the Aeronautics, IS&GS, and Space Systems business segments as well as Corporate Headquarters.  These charges reduced net earnings for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 by $88 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions.  Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments based on years of service, which are expected to be paid through the first half of 2012.
During the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010, the Corporation incurred a charge of $42 million, net of state tax benefits, related to facilities consolidation within its Electronic Systems business segment.  Additionally, results for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010, included a charge of $178 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP).  These charges reduced net earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010 by $27 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010 by $143 million, or $0.38 per diluted share.
 
 
12
 
 
The Corporation expects to recover a substantial amount of these charges, including the charge related to the VESP, in future periods through the pricing of the Corporations products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers.  While the VESP is expected to be recovered over several years, the other severance charges would typically be expected to be recovered within a one year period.  For example, Space Systems recovered most of its quarter ended June 26, 2011 severance charge in the second half of 2011.
Income Taxes
The Corporations effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 27.7 percent and 26.5 percent during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2011, respectively, and 22.3 percent and 30.8 percent during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2010, respectively. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and dividends related to certain of the Corporations defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.  The effective tax rates for the comparable periods were also impacted by the following items:
 
 
13
 
 
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations include the operating results for Savi for all periods presented and also Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE) for 2010 and through the date of its sale on April 4, 2011, and those of Enterprise Integration Group (EIG) for 2010, through the date of its sale on Nov. 22, 2010.
Discontinued operations for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 includes a benefit to net income of approximately $40 million related to the decision to sell Savi, the principal driver of which is a tax benefit due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset for book and tax differences recorded when the decision was made to sell Savi.  The quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2010 includes an impairment charge of $109 million related to the sale of PAE and similar deferred tax benefits of $86 million and $182 million, respectively.  The quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010 also includes a gain of $184 million for the sale of EIG.
