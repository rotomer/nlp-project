News Release
For Immediate Release
 
LOCKHEED MARTIN ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
 
 
BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 24, 2012  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) today reported third quarter 2012 net sales of $11.9 billion compared to $12.1 billion in 2011. Net earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 were $727 million, or $2.21 per diluted share, compared to $665 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, in 2011. Cash from operations during the third quarter of 2012 was $1.6 billion, compared to cash from operations of $551 million after pension contributions of $960 million during the third quarter of 2011.
 
The third quarter of 2012 included a non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $207 million, which reduced net earnings by $128 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to a non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $231 million, which reduced net earnings by $143 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in 2011. The third quarter of 2012 also included a special charge of $23 million, which reduced net earnings by $15 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to the previously announced workforce reductions at Electronic Systems. The third quarter of 2011 included special charges of $39 million, which reduced net earnings by $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to workforce reductions at the Corporations Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business segment and Corporate Headquarters.
 
Our strong operating results this quarter are a reflection of several factors, including our relentless focus on affordability and program execution, said Bob Stevens, chairman and chief executive officer.  We also have a strategy that is aligned with our customers, a proven portfolio of products and technologies, and a team that is talented and dedicated, even with the uncertainties that lie ahead.  We remain focused on meeting our customer commitments and delivering value to our shareholders.
 
 
Summary Reported Results
 
The following table presents the Corporations results for the periods referenced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
 
 
 
2012 Financial Outlook
 
The following table and other sections of this press release contain forward-looking statements, which are based on the Corporations current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. It is the Corporation's practice not to incorporate adjustments into its outlook for proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, changes in tax laws, or special items until such transactions have been consummated or enacted. See the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section contained in this press release.
 
2013 Financial Trends
 
The Corporations preliminary outlook for 2013 is premised on the assumption that sequestration does not occur, that the U.S. Government continues to support and fund the Corporation's programs, which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through March 2013, and that Congress approves defense budget legislation for government fiscal year 2013 at a level consistent with the Presidents proposed defense budget for the second half of the U.S. Governments fiscal year 2013. With these assumptions, the Corporation expects 2013 net sales will decline at a low single digit rate from 2012 levels primarily as a result of a projected mid single digit decline in IS&GS net sales. The Corporations preliminary outlook also indicates that the 2013 business segment operating profit margin will remain above 11 percent.  If sequestration or other budgetary cuts to avoid sequestration occur, the Corporation expects these budget reductions could have a material effect on its 2013 results of operations, earnings, and cash flows (see the Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 24, 2012).
 
 
The Corporations outlook for its 2013 non-cash FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment is premised on the assumptions that the discount rate at the end of 2012 is 4.0 percent, a 75 basis points decrease from 2011, actual investment returns for 2012 are 8.0 percent, pension funding is comparable to 2012, and all other assumptions are held constant. With these assumptions, the Corporation expects its 2013 non-cash FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment would be approximately $700 million. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points to the assumed discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $145 million in the estimated 2013 non-cash FAS/CAS pension expense adjustment. The Corporation will finalize its postretirement benefit plan assumptions and determine the actual return on plan assets on Dec. 31, 2012. The final assumptions and actual return on plan assets for 2012 may differ materially from those discussed.
 
Cash Deployment Activities
 
The Corporation deployed cash in 2012 by:
 
 
On Sept. 27, 2012, the Corporation increased its quarterly dividend rate 15 percent, or $0.15 per share, to $1.15 per share beginning with the payment on Dec. 28, 2012, to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 3, 2012.
 
 
Segment Results
 
The Corporation currently operates in four business segments: Aeronautics; Electronic Systems; IS&GS; and Space Systems. Operating profit for the business segments includes equity earnings and losses from investees because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. The Corporations equity investments primarily include United Launch Alliance (ULA) and United Space Alliance (USA), both of which are part of Space Systems.
 
As announced on Oct. 8, 2012, in order to streamline the Corporations operations and enhance customer alignment, the Electronic Systems business segment will be reorganized effective Dec. 31, 2012 into two new business segments: Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) and Mission Systems and Training (MST).  In connection with this reorganization, the Electronic Systems corporate management layer will be eliminated, and the Global Training and Logistics business will be split between the two new business segments.  In addition, the business reporting relationship for the Sandia National Laboratories and the U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment joint venture will transfer from Electronic Systems to Space Systems. Following the reorganization, the Corporation will have five business segments comprised of Aeronautics, IS&GS, MFC, MST, and Space Systems.  These changes do not affect the amounts, discussion, or presentation of the Corporations business segments as set forth in this press release.  The Corporation will begin to report its financial results consistent with this new structure beginning with its earnings press release reporting fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and 2013 outlook.
 
 
The following table presents summary operating results of the current four business segments and reconciles these amounts to the Corporations consolidated financial results.
 
 
In the discussion of comparative segment results, changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
 
In addition, comparability of the Corporations operating profit may be impacted by changes in estimated profit booking rates on the Corporations contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Increases in the estimated profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the estimated profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit may also be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by matters that are not accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, such as the resolution of contractual matters, reserves for disputes, asset impairments, and insurance recoveries, among others. Segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates, or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
 
 
The Corporations consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments and other matters, represented approximately 30 percent and 36 percent of total segment operating profit for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively, and approximately 30 percent of total segment operating profit for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2011.
 
Aeronautics
 
 
Net sales for the Aeronautics business segment decreased $267 million, or 7 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of approximately $375 million for C-130 programs due to fewer aircraft deliveries (eight aircraft delivered in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 13 in the same 2011 period); a decrease of about $135 million for the F-22 programs due to lower production as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 and lower risk retirements; and approximately $40 million related to F-16 programs due to lower volume on sustainment activities partially offset by increased aircraft deliveries (six aircraft delivered in the third quarter of 2012 compared to five in the same 2011 period). Partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in net sales of approximately $300 million due to increased production volume for F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts.
 
 
Net sales for the Aeronautics business segment increased $305 million, or 3 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in net sales was attributable to an increase of approximately $760 million for F-35 LRIP contracts as a result of increased production volume and about $305 million for F-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries (29 F-16 aircraft delivered in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 17 in the same 2011 period). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of about $350 million for the F-22 programs due to decreased production and lower risk retirements; a decline of about $145 million for the F-35 development contract due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume; approximately $140 million for C-130 programs principally due to decreased aircraft deliveries (25 C-130J aircraft delivered in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 26 in the same 2011 period) and aircraft configuration mix; and a decrease of approximately $125 million for other sustainment activities as a result of lower risk retirements and decreased volume.
 
Operating profit for the Aeronautics business segment decreased $29 million, or 7 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $65 million for the F-22 programs and about $45 million for other sustainment activities both due to declines in risk retirements. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher operating profit of approximately $50 million for F-16 programs as a result of higher risk retirements, and about $35 million due to increased volume and risk retirements for other various programs. Operating profit for C-130 programs was comparable as the decline in profit from aircraft deliveries was largely offset by increased risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $10 million lower in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
Operating profit for the Aeronautics business segment increased $85 million, or 7 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in operating profit was attributable to approximately $100 million for F-16 programs driven by increased risk retirements and higher aircraft deliveries, an increase of about $95 million for C-130 programs due to risk retirements on international production contracts, an increase of about $50 million for F-35 LRIP contracts due to increased risk retirements and higher production volume, an increase of about $40 million due to increased risk retirements on various programs, and a reduction of purchased intangible amortization expense on F-16 contracts of about $40 million. Partially offsetting the increases were lower operating profit of approximately $95 million for other sustainment activities principally due to declines in risk retirements; a decline of about $90 million for the F-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012; and a decrease of approximately $50 million for the F-22 programs due to lower volume and risk retirements partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments and the resolution of the contractual matter described above, were approximately $5 million higher in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
 
Electronic Systems
 
 
Net sales for the Electronic Systems business segment increased $155 million, or 4 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in net sales was attributable to higher volume of approximately $95 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (Aegis and other radar systems), increased volume of about $40 million on tactical missile programs (Javelin), about $35 million for air and missile defense programs (Patriot Advanced Capability-3), and approximately $25 million for fire control systems programs (Longbow). Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of about $35 million for undersea systems programs due to lower volume.
 
Net sales for the Electronic Systems business segment increased $368 million, or 3 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase was attributable to higher volume and risk retirements of approximately $410 million from ship and aviation programs (Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS), Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60), and about $135 million from tactical missile programs (Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM), Javelin). Partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales due to decreased volume of about $65 million primarily from training and logistics programs, approximately $60 million from fire control systems programs (Sniper
), and $45 million from undersea systems programs.
 
Operating profit for the Electronic Systems business segment increased $62 million, or 14 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $35 million for air and missile defense programs (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) as a result of increased risk retirements and approximately $25 million for ship and aviation programs primarily due to reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2011. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $45 million higher in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
 
Operating profit for the Electronic Systems business segment increased $219 million, or 16 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $165 million from ship and aviation programs (PTDS, Vertical Launching System, MH-60) as a result of increased risk retirements in the third quarter of 2012 and reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2011, about $75 million from tactical missile programs (Javelin, Hellfire, JASSM, Multiple Launch Rocket System) due to increased risk retirements and volume, and about $50 million from a resolution of contractual matters. Partially offsetting these increases was lower operating profit from reducing profit booking rates on certain programs, including training and logistics programs, and a net increase in various costs, including severance. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments and the resolution of contractual matters described above, were approximately $280 million higher in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
Information Systems & Global Solutions
 
 
Net sales for the IS&GS business segment decreased $31 million, or 1 percent, during the third quarter and $188 million, or 3 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding periods in 2011. The decreases in net sales during both periods were attributable to declines of approximately $40 million during the third quarter and $100 million during the first nine months from the completion of the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative program for NASA, decreases of about $30 million during the third quarter and $150 million during the first nine months due to cessation of the Airborne Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System program, and declines of about $30 million during the third quarter and $85 million during the first nine months from the completion of the U.K. Census program in the fourth quarter of 2011. Additionally, net sales also decreased during the first nine months by about $75 million due to lower volume on the Hanford program as a result of decreased funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Partially offsetting the decreases were increases of approximately $70 million during the third quarter and $220 million during the first nine months as a result of increased activity for other numerous programs, primarily federal cyber security programs and PTDS operational support, as well as net sales from an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2011.
 
 
The declines in operating profit for the IS&GS business segment during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding periods in 2011 primarily were attributable to lower net sales. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments, were approximately $5 million lower in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011, and approximately $35 million higher in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
Space Systems
 
 
Net sales for the Space Systems business segment decreased $107 million, or 5 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of approximately $105 million for commercial and government satellite programs primarily as a result of fewer commercial satellite deliveries (no satellites delivered in the third quarter of 2012 compared to one in the same 2011 period).
 
Net sales for the Space Systems business segment increased $310 million, or 5 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in net sales was attributable to an increase of approximately $165 million for commercial and government satellite programs primarily driven by higher commercial satellite deliveries (two deliveries in the first nine months of 2012 compared to one in the same 2011 period), an increase of about $125 million due to higher production volume and risk retirements for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) program, and an increase of approximately $65 million due to higher volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs. Partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of about $45 million for the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the Space Shuttle program during the second quarter of 2011.
 
 
Operating profit for the Space Systems business segment increased $50 million, or 20 percent, during the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in operating profit was attributable to approximately $85 million of higher equity earnings for ULA and USA inclusive of launch related activities at ULA and the resolution of contract cost matters associated with the wind-down of USA, which was partially offset by decreased volume and lower risk retirements of about $30 million for commercial and government satellite activities. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $10 million lower in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
Operating profit for the Space Systems business segment increased $78 million, or 11 percent, during the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011. The increase in operating profit was attributable to an increase of approximately $40 million primarily due to increased risk retirements on the Orion program and about $40 million for commercial and government satellite programs as a result of higher commercial satellite deliveries and risk retirements. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $30 million higher in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
 
Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems business segment from ULA and USA represented about $120 million, or 40 percent, and approximately $170 million, or 21 percent, of this segments operating profit during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively.  During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems business segment from ULA and USA represented about $35 million, or 14 percent, and approximately $165 million, or 23 percent, respectively of this segments operating profit.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Corporations effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 30.5 percent and 30.1 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively, and 29.9 percent and 26.1 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for U.S. manufacturing activities and dividends paid to certain defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature. The effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 also included the U.S. research and development tax credit that expired on Dec. 31, 2011. This benefit will not be incorporated into the Corporations 2012 outlook unless new legislation is enacted. In addition, the effective income tax rates for the first nine months of 2011 included a reduction to income tax expense of $89 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, through the elimination of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation completing its review of the Internal Revenue Service Appeals Divisions resolution of adjustments related to tax years 2003 through 2008.
