Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
In LNC's Management's Discussion and Analysis on Form 10-Q for June 30, 2002, LNC discussed the use of a "reversion-to-the-mean" assumption in the determination of the deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") asset and related cumulative pre-tax amortization and reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDB") in its Retirement segment. Investors have asked what the effect of this methodology is on the DAC asset and GMDB reserve. In order for users to better understand the effect of using reversion-to-the-mean methodology, the following information is provided. At June 30, 2002, Lincoln Retirement's DAC asset included $37 million attributable to the use of this methodology. The amount attributable to the reversion-to-the-mean represents approximately 4% of Lincoln Retirement's DAC asset at June 30, 2002.
     The use of net equity growth rates which are consistent with those used in the DAC amortization process lessens the impact of the equity markets on LNC's reserves for GMDB by $14 million.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
