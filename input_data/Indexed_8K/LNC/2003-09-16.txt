EXHIBIT 1.1
September 4, 2003
     From time to time, Lincoln National Capital VI, Lincoln National Capital VII, Lincoln National Capital VIII or Lincoln National Capital IX, each a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (each a "Trust" and collectively, the "Trusts"), and Lincoln National Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the "Guarantor"), as depositor of each Trust and as Guarantor, propose to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, which shall provide that the Trust identified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (such Trust being the "Designated Trust" with respect to such Pricing Agreement) shall issue and sell to the firms (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its preferred securities (the "Securities") identified in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Designated Securities") representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Designated Trust, guaranteed by the Guarantor to the extent set forth in the guarantee agreement (the "Guarantee") identified in such Pricing Agreement. If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Designated Trust may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Securities, specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and any Optional Designated Securities are collectively called the "Designated Securities." The proceeds of the sale of the Designated Securities and of common securities of the Trust (the "Common Securities") sold to the Guarantor are to be invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Guarantor (the "Subordinated Debentures"), to be issued pursuant to a junior subordinated indenture (the "Indenture") identified in the Pricing Agreement.
     The Designated Securities may be exchangeable into Subordinated Debentures, as specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement. Pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement identified in the Pricing Agreement relating to any particular issuance of Designated Securities, the Designated Securities will be guaranteed by the Guarantor to the extent set forth in such Pricing Agreement (the "Guarantee").
 
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the amended and restated trust agreement (the "Trust Agreement") identified in such Pricing Agreement.
     Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. These Underwriting Agreement Basic Provisions (the "Underwriting Agreement") shall not be construed as an obligation of any Trust to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of any Trust to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities, the aggregate number of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated Securities, including the terms on which and terms of the securities into which the Designated Securities will be exchangeable, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the number of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Trust Agreement or the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
     The Designated Trust may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Designated Trust thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Over-allotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Designated Securities set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Designated Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Designated Securities may be exercised only by written notice from the Representatives to the Designated Trust and the Guarantor, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Designated Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Designated Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 3 hereof) or, unless the Representatives, the Guarantor and the Designated Trust otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.

The total number of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Designated Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
 
     3.     Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in definitive form to the extent practicable, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Designated Trust, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Designated Trust to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by certified or official bank check or checks, payable to the order of the Designated Trust in the funds specified in such Pricing Agreement, all in the manner and at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Designated Trust may agree upon in writing. Such time and date for delivery of Firm Designated Securities pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto is herein called the "First Time of Delivery," such time and date for delivery of Optional Designated Securities, if not the First Time of Delivery, is herein called the "Second Time of Delivery," and each such time and date is herein called the "Time of Delivery."
     4.     The Designated Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities:
          (a)  To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Guarantor with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities or the Subordinated Debentures issuable upon exchange of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;
 
          (b)  Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities or the Subordinated Debentures issuable upon exchange of the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith neither the Designated Trust nor the Guarantor shall be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
          (c)  To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities or the Subordinated Debentures issuable upon exchange of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and, upon the request of the Representatives, to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;

          (f)  In the case of the Guarantor, to issue the Guarantee concurrently with the issue and sale of the Securities as contemplated herein or in the Pricing Agreement.
     5.     The Guarantor covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Guarantor will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Trusts' and the Guarantor's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities, the Guarantees and the Subordinated Debentures under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Trust Agreement, any Indenture, any Guarantee, any Blue Sky or similar investment surveys or memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all reasonable expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities, the Guarantees and the Subordinated Debentures for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities and the Subordinated Debentures; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required reviews by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities and the issuance of the Guarantees and the Subordinated Debentures; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities and the Subordinated Debentures; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee, Debenture Trustee and Guarantee Trustee, and any agent of any trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any trustee in connection with any Trust Agreement, Indenture, Guarantee and the Securities; (viii) the cost of qualifying the Securities with The Depository Trust Company; (ix) all fees and expenses in connection with the listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the cost of registering the Securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder and under any Over-allotment Option which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 8 and Section 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     6.     The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Designated Trust and the Guarantor in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the date of the Pricing Agreement and at the respective Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall have performed all of their respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
          (a)  The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within
 
the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
          (b)  Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated the respective Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Guarantor and the formation of the Designated Trust, the validity of the Designated Securities, the Subordinated Debentures, the Guarantee, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
          (c)  Dennis Schoff, Esq. or the then General Counsel for the Guarantor, shall have furnished to the Representatives his or her written opinion, dated the respective Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
     Such counsel shall also furnish you with a letter to the effect that, as counsel to the Guarantor, he has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
 
statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; it being understood that such counsel may state that he has not independently verified factual statements in the Prospectus (or any such amendment or supplement) and that no comment need be given as to the portion of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Form T-1;
          (d)  Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP, Counsel for the Designated Trust and the Guarantor, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated the respective Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
 
 
     Such counsel shall also furnish you with a letter to the effect that, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Guarantor or the Designated Trust prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need not comment) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; it being understood that such counsel may state that such counsel has not independently verified factual statements in the Prospectus (or any such amendment or supplement);
          (e)  Richards, Layton & Finger, special Delaware Counsel to the Designated Trust and the Guarantor, shall have furnished to you, the Guarantor and the Designated Trust
 
their written opinion, dated the respective Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
 
          (f)  Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP, tax counsel for the Designated Trust and the Guarantor, shall have furnished to you their written opinion, dated the respective Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that such firm confirms its opinion set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences";
          (g)  At the respective Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, and, if so specified in the Pricing Agreement, on the date of the Pricing Agreement, the independent accountants of the Guarantor who have certified the financial statements of the Guarantor and its
 
subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated such Time of Delivery and, if applicable, such date of the Pricing Agreement, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
          (h)  Except as contemplated in the Prospectus, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented until the respective Time of Delivery of the Designated Securities, there shall not have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights or pursuant to existing employee benefit plans and upon conversions of convertible securities which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries in excess of 5% or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (i)  On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities until the respective Time of Delivery of the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock (or securities guaranteed by the Guarantor) by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock (or securities guaranteed by the Guarantor);
          (j)  On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities until the respective Time of Delivery of the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Guarantor's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities;
 
          (k)  The Designated Securities to be sold by the Designated Trust at the respective Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange;
          (l)  The Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the respective Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities certificates of officers of the Designated Trust and the Guarantor satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Designated Trust and the Guarantor herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Designated Trust and the Guarantor of all of their obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (h) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and
          (m)  The Securities shall been duly approved for listing, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
     7.     The Designated Trust and the Guarantor will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Designated Trust nor the Guarantor shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Designated Trust or the Guarantor by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities and; provided, further, that neither the Designated Trust nor the Guarantor shall be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any loss, claim, damage or liability resulting from an untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact in a Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction has found by final and nonappealable order that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the
 
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), if such Underwriter failed to make efforts generally consistent with the then prevailing industry practice to effect such delivery and such delivery to such person is required by Section 5 of the Act, the Designated Trust or the Guarantor has furnished copies of such Prospectus as amended or supplemented to such Underwriter a reasonable period of time prior to the Underwriter being required to deliver such Prospectus as amended or supplemented and such Prospectus as amended or supplemented corrected the untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus.
          (a)  Each Underwriter, severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the Designated Trust, the Guarantor and each of their respective directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls either the Guarantor or the Designated Trust within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or State statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Designated Trust or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) as such expenses are incurred.
          (b)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses
 
of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if the indemnified party reasonably believes that representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding (it being understood that in no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances). No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided however
          (c)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Designated Trust and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Designated Trust and the Guarantor on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Designated Trust less the total underwriting compensation paid by the Guarantor bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Designated Trust and the Guarantor on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
 
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Designated Trust, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (d)  The obligations of the Designated Trust and the Guarantor under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Designated Trust and the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor, to each administrative trustee of the Designated Trust and to each person, if any, who controls the Designated Trust or the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
     8.     If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or the Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Designated Trust and the Guarantor that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Designated Trust and the Guarantor notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or
 
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Designated Trust and the Guarantor agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
          (a)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (b)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Designated Trust and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Designated Trust or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Designated Trust, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     9.     The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Designated Trust, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results
 
thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Designated Trust, the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Designated Trust or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     10.     If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, neither the Designated Trust nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Designated Trust as provided herein, the Designated Trust and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Designated Trust and the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof.
     11.     In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Designated Trust or the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Designated Trust or the Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Corporate Secretary, with a copy to Lincoln National Corporation, 1500 Market Street, Suite 3900, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, Attention: Legal Department, Facsimile Transmission No. (215) 977-2878; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Designated Trust and the Guarantor by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     12.     This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Designated Trust and the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Designated Trust or the Guarantor and each person who controls the Designated Trust, the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
     13.     Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     14.     
THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
     15.     This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Section 4.1 Distributions.
     (a)  Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative, and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Trust available for the payment of Distributions. Distributions shall accrue from September 11, 2003, and, except in the event that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on December 31, 2003. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, payment of such Distribution shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date (each date on which distributions are payable in accordance with this Section 4.1(a), a "Distribution Date").
     (b)  The Trust Securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust Property, and, as a practical matter, the Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be payable at a rate of 6.75% per annum of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities. The amount of Distributions payable for any full period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include the Additional Amounts, if any.
     (c)  Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions.
     (d)  Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record date, which shall be one Business Day prior to such Distribution Date; provided, however, that in the event that the Preferred Securities do not remain in book-entry-only form, the relevant record date shall be the date 15 days prior to the relevant Distribution Date.
Section 4.2 Redemption.
     (a)  On each Debenture Redemption Date and on the stated maturity of the Debentures, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price.
 
     (b)  Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state:
     (c)  The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price.
     (d)  If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Preferred Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, so long as the Preferred Securities are in book-entry-only form, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for the Preferred Securities funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the holders thereof. If the Preferred Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders thereof upon surrender of their Preferred Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on
 
the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accrue, at the then applicable rate, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
     (e)  Payment of the Redemption Price on the Trust Securities shall be made to the recordholders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record date, which shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant Redemption Date; provided, however, that in the event that the Preferred Securities do not remain in book-entry-only form, the relevant record date shall be the date fifteen days prior to the relevant Redemption Date.
     (f)  Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated on a pro rata basis (based on Liquidation Amounts) among the Common Securities and the Preferred Securities. The particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts) not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method (including, without limitation, by lot) as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to $25 or an integral multiple of $25 in excess thereof) of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities of a denomination larger than $25. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Security Registrar in writing of the Preferred Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred Securities shall relate, in the case of any Preferred Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities that has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 4.3 Subordination of Common Securities.
     (a)  Payment of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, and the Redemption Price of, the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made, subject to Section 4.2(f), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Preferred Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or Redemption Price of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on all Outstanding Preferred Securities for all Distribution periods
 
terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Preferred Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or the Redemption Price of, Preferred Securities then due and payable.
     (b)  In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holder of Common Securities will be deemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Preferred Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Preferred Securities has been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Preferred Securities and not the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf.
Section 4.4 Payment Procedures.
     Payments of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) in respect of the Preferred Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Preferred Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency in immediately available funds, which shall credit the relevant Persons' accounts at such Clearing Agency on the applicable distribution dates. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Common Securityholder.

The Administrative Trustees shall provide the Depositor and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns and reports promptly after such filing or furnishing.

Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Securityholder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Securityholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Sections 5.4, 5.11 and 5.13.

     The Depositor shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8, a register or registers for the purpose of registering Trust Securities Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Preferred Securities Certificates (the "Securities Register") in

In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account for the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The Administrative Trustees may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if such Trustees determine in their sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Trust Agreement in any material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Bank, and acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees, the Property Trustee and the Depositor. In the event that the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Administrative Trustees shall appoint a successor that is acceptable to the Property Trustee and the Depositor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company).

To the fullest extent permitted by law, other than a transfer in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another corporation, or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Indenture, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE".
Section 5.11 Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates; Common Securities Certificate.
     (a)  The Preferred Securities Certificates, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a typewritten Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates representing Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates, to be delivered to The Depository Trust Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Trust. Such Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates shall initially be registered on the Securities Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no beneficial owner will receive a Definitive Preferred Securities Certificate representing such beneficial owner's interest in such Preferred Securities, except as provided in Section 5.13.

Upon surrender to the Property Trustee of the typewritten Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates representing the Book Entry Preferred Securities Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of
 
them, shall execute the Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Neither the Securities Registrar nor the Trustees shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates, the Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates as Securityholders. The Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them.
Section 5.14 Rights of Securityholders.
     (a)  The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Securityholders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Securityholders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Trust. The Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     (b)  For so long as any Preferred Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then Outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount of and the accrued interest on all of the Debentures shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest on such Debentures shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in the Indenture.
     (c)  For so long as any Preferred Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails to exercise directly any remedy available to the Holders of the Debentures for 60 days, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then Outstanding shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the right to directly institute proceedings for enforcement of payment to such Holders of principal amount of or interest on the Debentures having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holders.
 
Section 6.1 Limitations on Voting Rights.
     (a)  Except as provided in this Section, in Sections 5.2, 8.10 and 10.2 and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Preferred Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Securityholders from time to time as partners or members of an association.
     (b)  So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee, the Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to such Debentures, (ii) waive any past default which is waivable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of all Outstanding Preferred Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each Holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Preferred Securities. The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Preferred Securities of any notice of default received from the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as an association taxable as a corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes on account of such action.
     (c)  If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Preferred Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Preferred Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities. No amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, the Trust would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
Section 6.2 Notice of Meetings.
     Notice of all meetings of the Preferred Securityholders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Preferred Securityholder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.
Section 6.3 Meetings of Preferred Securityholders.
     No annual meeting of Securityholders is required to be held. The Administrative Trustees, however, shall call a meeting of Securityholders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Preferred Securityholders of record of 25% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of Preferred Securityholders to vote on any matters as to which Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote.
     Preferred Securityholders of record of 50% of the Outstanding Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount), present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Securityholders.
     If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding more than a majority of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) held by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Securityholders, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
Section 6.4 Voting Rights.
     Securityholders shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Securityholders are entitled to vote.
Section 6.5 Proxies, etc.
     At any meeting of Securityholders, any Securityholder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Administrative Trustees, or with such other officer or agent of the Trust as the Administrative Trustees may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Securityholders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf
 
of a Securityholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
Section 6.6 Securityholder Action by Written Consent.
     Any action which may be taken by Securityholders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Securityholders holding more than a majority of all Outstanding Trust Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing.
Section 6.7 Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.
     For the purposes of determining the Securityholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Securityholders or the payment of a distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Securityholders of record for such purposes.
Section 6.8 Acts of Securityholders.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Securityholders or Owners may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Securityholders or Owners in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to an Administrative Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Securityholders or Owners signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
     The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which any Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.
     The ownership of Preferred Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
 
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Securityholder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Securityholder of the same Trust Security and the Securityholder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.
     Without limiting the foregoing, a Securityholder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such liquidation amount.
     If any dispute shall arise between the Securityholders and the Administrative Trustees or among such Securityholders or Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.
     A Securityholder may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Depositor under the Guarantee to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Guarantee Trustee (as defined in the Guarantee), the Trust or any person or entity.
Section 6.9 Inspection of Records.
     Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Trust shall be open to inspection by Securityholders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Securityholder's interest as a Securityholder.
Section 7.1 Representations and Warranties of the Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.
     The Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, each severally on behalf of and as to itself, hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Depositor and the Securityholders that:
     (a)  Bank One Delaware, Inc. is a Delaware corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. is a national banking association duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States;
     (b)  each of the Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee has full corporate power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
 
this Trust Agreement and has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Trust Agreement;
     (c)  this Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of such Person enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
     (d)  the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee of this Trust Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of the Bank, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, respectively, and does not require any approval of stockholders of the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee and such execution, delivery and performance will not (i) violate the Bank's, the Property Trustee's or the Delaware Trustee's Charter or By-laws, (ii) violate any provision of, or constitute, with or without notice or lapse of time, a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, any Lien on any properties included in the Trust Property pursuant to the provisions of, any indenture, mortgage, credit agreement, license or other agreement or instrument to which the Property Trustee, the Bank or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, is a party or by which it is bound, or (iii) violate any law, governmental rule or regulation of the United States or the State of Delaware, as the case may be, governing the corporate, banking or trust powers of the Bank or the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (as appropriate in context) or any order, judgment or decree applicable to the Property Trustee, the Bank or the Delaware Trustee;
     (e)  neither the authorization, execution or delivery by the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee of this Trust Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions by the Bank, the Property Trustee, or the Delaware Trustee (as the case may be) contemplated herein or therein requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration with or the taking of any other action with respect to any governmental authority or agency under any existing Federal law governing the corporate, banking or trust powers of the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as appropriate in context, under the laws of the United States or the State of Delaware; and
     (f)  there are no proceedings pending or, to the best of each of the Bank's, the Property Trustee's and the Delaware Trustee's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee in any court or before any governmental authority, agency or arbitration board or tribunal which, individually or in the aggregate, would materially and adversely affect the Trust or would question the right, power and authority of the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, to enter into or perform its obligations as one of the Trustees under this Trust Agreement.
Section 7.2 Representations and Warranties of Depositor.
     The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Securityholders that:
 
     (a)  the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Trust have been duly authorized and will have been, duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement and the Securityholders will be, as of each such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and
     (b)  there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Trust (or the Trustees on behalf of the Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Bank, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement.
Section 8.1 Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
     (a)  The duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, subject to the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Administrative Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to the Securityholders, such Administrative Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Securityholder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Securityholders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees.
     (b)  All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Securityholder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth
 
elsewhere in this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
     (c)  No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
Section 8.2 Certain Notices.
     Within five Business Days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Securityholders, the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
     Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Administrative Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8,
 
notice of such exercise to the Securityholders and the Property Trustee, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
Section 8.3 Certain Rights of Property Trustee.
     Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1:
     (a)  the Property Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
     (b)  if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action or (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting written instructions of the Depositor as to the course of action to be taken and the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or to refrain from taking, by the Depositor and the Property Trustee shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; provided, however, that if the Property Trustee does not receive such instructions of the Depositor within ten Business Days after it has delivered such notice, or such reasonably shorter period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent practicable shall not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Trust Agreement as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Securityholders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct;
     (c)  any direction or act of the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate;
     (d)  whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be established before undertaking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Property Trustee (unless other evidence is herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, request and rely upon an Officers' Certificate which, upon receipt of such request, shall be promptly delivered by the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees;
     (e)  the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any rerecording, refiling or reregistration thereof;
 
     (f)  the Property Trustee may consult with counsel (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction;
     (g)  the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
     (h)  the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit;
     (i)  the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or recklessness with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder;
     (j)  whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders of the Trust Securities which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action, (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and
     (k)  except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement.
     No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on the Property Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Property Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Property Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.
 
Section 8.4 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
     The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Depositor, and the Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures.
Section 8.5 May Hold Securities.
     Except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, any Trustee or any other agent of any Trustee or the Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, may otherwise deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not a Trustee or such other agent.
Section 8.6 Compensation; Indemnity; Fees.
     The Depositor agrees:
     (a)  to pay to the Trustees from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
     (b)  except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and
     (c)  to indemnify each of the Trustees or any predecessor Trustee for, and to hold the Trustees harmless against, any loss, damage, claims, liability, penalty or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Trust Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement or the resignation or removal of any Trustee.
     No Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any Trust Property as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.6.
Section 8.7 Corporate Property Trustee Required; Eligibility of Trustees.
     (a)  There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of
 
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
     (b)  There shall at all times be one or more Administrative Trustees hereunder. Each Administrative Trustee shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind that entity.
     (c)  There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee.

Section 8.8 Conflicting Interests.
     If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Depositor and any Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Neither the Depositor, nor any Trustee, shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and the Depositor or any Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Trustee may engage in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates.
Section 8.9 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee.
     Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees, by agreed action of the majority of such Trustees, shall have power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Administrative Trustees, the Depositor shall for such purpose join with the Administrative Trustees in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved
 
by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If the Depositor does not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity.
     Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co- trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co- trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor.
     Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely:
     (a)  The Trust Securities shall be executed and delivered and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustees specified hereunder, shall be exercised, solely by such Trustees and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
     (b)  The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
     (c)  The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section.
     (d)  No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder.
 
     (e)  The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee.
     (f)  Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.
Section 8.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
     No resignation or removal of any Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11.
     Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Trust Securities by giving written notice thereof to the Securityholders. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities.
     Unless a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Common Securityholder. If a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at such time by Act of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). An Administrative Trustee may be removed by the Common Securityholder at any time.
     If any Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Trustee for any cause, at a time when no Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Common Securityholder, by Act of the Common Securityholder delivered to the retiring Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust, and the retiring Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Preferred Securityholders, by Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then Outstanding delivered to the retiring Relevant Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust, and such successor Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11.
     If an Administrative Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Administrative Trustee, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Common Securityholder by Act of the Common Securityholder delivered to the Administrative Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor Administrative Trustee or
 
Administrative Trustees with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust, and such successor Administrative Trustee or Trustees shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall have been so appointed by the Common Securityholder or the Preferred Securityholders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Securityholder who has been a Securityholder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities.
     The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee to all Securityholders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Administrative Trustee or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Depositor, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by (a) the unanimous act of remaining Administrative Trustees if there are at least two of them or (b) otherwise by the Depositor (with the successor in each case being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 8.7).
Section 8.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
     In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Trust and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Depositor or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and if the Property Trustee is the resigning Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to the successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Property Trustee hereunder.
     In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co-trustees of
 
the same trust and that each such Relevant Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Relevant Trustee and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust; but, on request of the Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust.
     Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.
     No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
Section 8.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
     Any corporation into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
Section 8.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Trust.
     If and when the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Trust (or any other obligor upon the Debentures or the Trust Securities), the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, shall be subject to and shall take all actions necessary in order to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or Trust (or any such other obligor).
Section 8.14 Reports by Property Trustee.
     (a)  Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with May 15, 2004, the Property Trustee shall transmit to all Securityholders in accordance with Section 10.8, and to the Depositor, a brief report dated as of such May 15 with respect to:
 
     (b)  In addition the Property Trustee shall transmit to Securityholders such reports concerning the Property Trustee and its actions under this Trust Agreement as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto.
     (c)  A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Property Trustee with each national stock exchange, the Nasdaq National Market or such other interdealer quotation system or self- regulatory organization upon which the Trust Securities are listed or traded, with the Commission and with the Depositor.
Section 8.15 Reports to the Property Trustee.
     The Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act (if any) and the compliance certificate required by Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act in the form, in the manner and at the times required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act.
Section 8.16 Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent.
     Each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Trust Agreement that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314 (c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given by an officer pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act shall be given in the form of an Officers' Certificate.
Section 8.17 Number of Trustees.
     (a)  The number of Trustees shall be four, provided that the Holder of all of the Common Securities by written instrument may increase or decrease the number of Administrative Trustees. The Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may be the same person.
     (b)  If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Administrative Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 8.17(a), or if the number of Trustees is increased
 
pursuant to Section 8.17(a), a vacancy shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 8.10.
     (c)  The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate to annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrative Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of an Administrative Trustee in accordance with Section 8.10, the Administrative Trustees in office, regardless of their number (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement), shall have all the powers granted to the Administrative Trustees and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Administrative Trustees by this Trust Agreement.

     (b)  The Administrative Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number or to the Depositor the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein.

     (a)  the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event in respect of, or the dissolution or liquidation of, the Depositor;

Section 9.4 Liquidation.
     (a)  If an Early Termination Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Trustees as expeditiously as the Trustees determine to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Securityholder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid mailed not later than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall:
     (b)  Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Securityholders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates.
 
     (c)  Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such certificates to the Administrative Trustees or their agent for exchange, (iii) the Depositor shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Debentures listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange, interdealer quotation system or self-regulatory organization as the Preferred Securities are then listed, (iv) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures, accruing interest at the rate provided for in the Debentures from the last Distribution Date on which a Distribution was made on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (v) all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates.
     (d)  In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Trust shall be dissolved, wound-up or terminated, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee reasonably determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Trust, Securityholders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The holder of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Preferred Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Preferred Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities.

     The Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except pursuant to this Section 9.5. At the request of the Depositor, with the consent of only the Administrative Trustees and without the consent of the Property Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or the holders of the Preferred Securities, the Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any State; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Preferred Securities or (b) substitutes for the Preferred Securities other securities
 
having substantially the same terms as the Preferred Securities (the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as the Preferred Securities rank in priority with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) the Depositor expressly appoints a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee as the holder of the Debentures, (iii) the Successor Securities are listed or traded, or any Successor Securities will be listed upon notification of issuance, on any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Preferred Securities are then listed or traded, if any, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (v) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (vi) such successor entity has a purpose identical to that of the Trust, (vii) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Depositor has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act and (viii) the Depositor owns all of the Common Securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust shall not, except with the consent of holders of 100% in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
Section 10.1 Limitation of Rights of Securityholders.
     The death or incapacity of any person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such person or any Securityholder for such person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them.

     (c)  In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each affected Securityholder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date or (a) restrict the right of a Securityholder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date; notwithstanding any other provision herein, without the unanimous consent of the Securityholders (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this paragraph (c) of this Section 10.2 may not be amended.
     (d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, no Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement which would cause the Trust to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status of an investment company under the 1940 Act or fail or cease to be classified as a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.
     (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, without the consent of the Depositor, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor.
     (f)  In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is made, the Administrative Trustees shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy of such amendment.
 
     (g)  Neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be required to enter into any amendment to this Trust Agreement which affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Trust Agreement. The Property Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is in compliance with this Trust Agreement.

No. E-1 $154,640,000
     LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Indiana (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Bank One Trust Company, National Association, as Property Trustee of Lincoln National Capital VI, or registered assigns, the principal sum of one hundred fifty-four million six hundred forty thousand dollars ($154,640,000) on September 11, 2052. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from September 11, 2003 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing December 31, 2003, at the rate of 6.75% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, plus Additional Interest, if any, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the rate of 6.75% per annum, compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or the principal office of the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement hereinafter referred to for Lincoln National Capital VI is closed for business. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in the Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be the date which is one Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be
 
paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
     The Company shall have the right at any time during the term of this Security, from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on such Security for up to 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Periods the Company shall have the right to make partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date, and at the end of which the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with Additional Interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law); provided that during any such Extension Period, the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of the Company's outstanding capital stock or (ii) make any payment of principal of, interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt security of the Company that ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to this Security or make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any subsidiary of the Company if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to the Securities (other than (a) dividends or distributions in Common Stock of the Company, (b) redemptions or purchases of any rights pursuant to the Company's Rights Plan, or any successor to such Rights Plan, and the declaration of a dividend of such rights or the issuance of Stock under such plans in the future, (c) payments under any Lincoln Guarantee (as defined in the Indenture), and (d) purchases of Common Stock related to the issuance of Common Stock under any of the Company's benefit plans for its directors, officers or employees). Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further extend the interest payment period, provided that no Extension Period shall exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the Maturity of this Security. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Holder of this Security and the Trustee notice of its election to begin an Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of (i) the date the Distributions on the Preferred Securities are payable or (ii) the date the Administrative Trustees are required to give notice to any securities exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to holders of such Preferred Securities of the record date or the date such Distributions are payable, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such record date.
     Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register.
     The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payments to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt, and
 
this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

Section 5.1 Guarantee.
     The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay in full to the Holders the Guarantee Payments (without duplication of amounts theretofore paid by or on behalf of the Issuer), as and when due, regardless of any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim which the Issuer may have or assert.

     (c)  any failure, omission, delay or lack of diligence on the part of the Holders to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on the Holders pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Securities, or any action on the part of the Issuer granting indulgence or extension of any kind;
     (d)  the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of any collateral, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment of debt of, or other similar proceedings affecting, the Issuer or any of the assets of the Issuer;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Guarantor has failed to make a Guarantee Payment, a Holder may directly institute a proceeding against the Guarantor for enforcement of this Guarantee Agreement for such payment. The Guarantor waives any right or remedy to
 
require that any action on this Guarantee Agreement be brought first against the Issuer or any other Person or entity before proceeding directly against the Guarantor.

     The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all (if any) rights of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid to the Holders by the Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement and shall have the right to waive payment by the Issuer pursuant to Section 5.1; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not (except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law) be entitled to enforce or exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation or any indemnity, reimbursement or other agreement, in all cases as a result of payment under this Guarantee Agreement if, at the time of any such payment, any amounts are due and unpaid under this Guarantee Agreement. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, the Guarantor agrees to hold such amount in trust for the Holders and to pay over such amount to the Holders.

     The Guarantor acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Issuer with respect to the Preferred Securities and that the Guarantor shall be liable as principal and as debtor hereunder to make Guarantee Payments pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee Agreement notwithstanding the occurrence of any event referred to in subsections (a) through (g), inclusive, of Section 5.3 hereof.
Section 6.1 Subordination.
     This Guarantee Agreement will constitute an unsecured obligation of the Guarantor and will rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all Senior Debt of the Guarantor.
