Exhibit 99.1
- Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), the parent company of the Lincoln Financial Group of companies, today reported net income of $187.0 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for its second quarter of 2004. By comparison, net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $142.7 million, or $0.80 per diluted share.
Philadelphia, PA, July 28, 2004
     Income from operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $181.4 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $153.3 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003. Return on equity for the quarter was 14.4 percent. The attached table reconciles net income to income from operations for the corporation and business segments.
     Consolidated domestic deposits, which include annuities, mutual funds, life insurance and other personal wealth accumulation products, were $7.9 billion for the quarter, of which $1.9 billion were contributed by Delaware International Advisers Ltd. (DIAL). As of June 30, 2004, assets under management were $151.3 billion, which includes $20.6 billion from DIAL. The previously announced management buyout of DIAL is expected to close in the third quarter of 2004.
     "We are very pleased with the solid results we reported this quarter. Our domestic manufacturing business lines reported earnings growth over the same period last year and we continued to gain momentum in many of our key distribution platforms," said Jon A. Boscia, chairman and chief executive officer. "Continued sales growth is due to deeper penetration within our distribution relationships with
 
multiple products that offer clients comprehensive financial solutions," added Boscia.
     The quarter was positively impacted by investment income from commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums and partnership income.
Life Insurance
     Life Insurance net income was $72.0 million versus $65.6 million for the same period a year ago. Income from operations for the segment was $76.2 million, up from $71.8 million in the second quarter of 2003. Retail sales grew 14 percent in the quarter versus both the second quarter and first half of 2003, driven by sales in universal life products including MoneyGuard which were up 13 percent over the second quarter of 2003. "The steady increase in sales creates long-term value for this business," said Boscia.
Lincoln Retirement
     Net income for the Retirement segment was $94.2 million, compared to $81.7 million for the second quarter of 2003. Second quarter income from operations for the segment was $101.8 million compared to $86.1 million in the year ago period. The Retirement segment reported record-breaking variable deposits of nearly $2.0 billion in the quarter and achieved a 600 percent increase in total net flows over the prior year period.
     "The continued growth in variable annuity deposits and net flows in the Retirement segment is attributable to distribution expansion and the acceptance of our guaranteed withdrawal benefit," said Boscia. "I am pleased to note that in July, the year-to-date sales of our American Legacy single-manager product and Lincoln ChoicePlus multi-manager product surpassed their full-year 2003 combined sales," added Boscia.
SM
Investment Management
     The Investment Management segment reported net income of $14.5 million in the quarter, up from $4.6 million in the same period a
 
year ago. Income from operations for the segment was $13.4 million in the second quarter, which compares to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2003. DIAL contributed $4.1 million to the Investment Management segment's income from operations in the second quarter.
     "Investment performance continues to do well, with over half of the top 25 retail funds outperforming their respective indices over the one, three and five year time periods," said Boscia.
Lincoln UK
     For the second quarter, the UK segment's net income was $17.2 million versus $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Income from operations was $10.7 million for the quarter, versus $12.4 million in the same year ago period.

     Corporate and Other, which includes financing, distribution losses, and the results flowing from the reinsurance business sold in 2001, reported a net loss of $10.9 million for the second quarter versus a net loss of $21.6 million for the same period a year ago. The operating loss, for the second quarter of 2004 was $20.7 million of which $11.8 million was related to distribution losses.
