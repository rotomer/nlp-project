NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), the parent company of the Lincoln Financial Group of companies, today reported net income of $199.7 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, for its third quarter of 2004. By comparison, net income for the third quarter of 2003 was $133.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share.
Philadelphia, PA, November 2, 2004 -
 
Income from operations for the third quarter of 2004 was $178.2 million, after-tax, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $156.0 million, after-tax, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003. The attached table defines and reconciles income from operations for the corporation and business segments to GAAP net income.
 
For the third quarter, investment income in the Life and Retirement segments from commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums continued to contribute to strong results. The quarter was also positively impacted by $0.05 per diluted share related to the cumulative amortization from an adjustment of the deferred gain on the sale of the reinsurance business. These positive contributors, in the quarter, were partially offset by higher expenses, including increased expenses related to Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB) reserves, now substantially hedged and not expected to be a significant item in future quarters.
 
After adjusting for the sale of Delaware International Advisors Ltd. (DIAL), consolidated domestic deposits, which include annuities, mutual funds, life insurance and other personal wealth accumulation products, reached a third quarter record of $5.75 billion. In addition, total net flows in the quarter increased 50 percent over the year ago period, which established a third quarter record. As of September 30, 2004, assets under management were $132.6 billion.
 
"Our deposits and net flows maintained the strong pace established earlier this year and also set third quarter records, despite the challenges of lackluster equity markets
 
and stubborn interest rates," said Jon A. Boscia, chairman and chief executive officer of Lincoln Financial Group. "We continue to build market share in our Retirement and Investment Management segments while our Life segment results reflect the competitive pressures that continue to dominate the Universal Life (UL) marketplace," added Boscia.
 
Lincoln completed its annual comprehensive review of prospective assumptions underlying the amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC), Present Value of In-Force (PVIF), Deferred Front-End Loads (DFEL) and GMDB reserves. The overall effect on earnings was virtually neutral when combined with the results from the retrospective unlocking of DAC and GMDB reserves, which included the impact from the movement in the equity markets during the quarter. While neutral overall, it did have a substantial effect on individual segments.
 
Lincoln Retirement
 
Net income for the Retirement segment was $90.8 million, compared to $102.0 million for the third quarter of 2003. Third quarter income from operations for the segment was $110.2 million versus $94.3 million in the year ago period.
 
The Retirement segment's results for the third quarter were favorably impacted by DAC unlocking and income from commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.
 
In the quarter, variable annuity deposits reached a record $2 billion, with variable annuity net flows achieving a record level of $782 million. "The Retirement segment delivered solid deposits and had record net flows in the third quarter, which underscores the importance of innovative products and distribution strength," said Boscia.
 
Life Insurance
 
Life Insurance net income was $52.0 million versus $55.8 million for the same period a year ago. Income from operations for the segment was $55.4 million, compared to $58.7 million in the third quarter of 2003.
 
Third quarter 2004 income for this segment was negatively impacted by DAC unlocking and higher expenses, partially offset by continued income from commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.
 
Total retail life first year premiums declined in the quarter due to competitive pressure in the UL marketplace. "Despite the competitive pressures, we remain focused on maintaining the balance between sound risk management and pricing discipline in order to create long-term value for our clients and shareholders," Boscia added.
 
Investment Management
 
The Investment Management segment reported net income of $58.1 million in the quarter, up from $6.3 million in the same period a year ago. Income from operations for the segment was $12.5 million in the third quarter, which compares to $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2003.
 
During the quarter, Lincoln completed the sale of DIAL and recognized $45.8 million, after-tax, of gain. Also, in the quarter, Lincoln migrated $776 million in assets previously administered by this segment to third parties, primarily to BISYS under a previously announced outsourcing arrangement. "We are focused on research and portfolio management, our core areas of expertise, which resulted in strong investment performance in our retail and institutional products," said Boscia.
 
Lincoln UK
 
For the third quarter, the UK segment's net income was $9.9 million versus $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2003. Income from operations was $10.1 million for the quarter, versus $11.3 million in the same year ago period.
 
Corporate and Other
 
Corporate and Other, which includes financing, distribution losses, and the results flowing from the reinsurance business sold in 2001, reported a net loss of $11.1 million for the third quarter versus a net loss of $42.3 million for the same period a year ago. The operating loss for the third quarter of 2004 was $10.0 million, of which $9.8 million was related to distribution losses. For the third quarter of 2003, the company reported an operating loss of $18.0 million, with $15.0 million attributed to distribution losses.
 
As of September 30, 2004, the book value of Lincoln National Corporation common stock, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, was $29.23, compared with $26.87 a year ago. Book value, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $34.15, compared with $31.34 a year ago. In the third quarter, 1.638 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $73.2 million.

The conference call will be available via a live webcast on the company's Website, www.LFG.com/webcast.

Definition of Income from Operations
 
Income from operations represents after-tax results excluding, as applicable, realized gains or losses on investments and derivatives, cumulative effect of accounting changes, restructuring charges, reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance, gain on sale of subsidiaries and block of business and loss on retirement of subordinate debt. Income from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and does not replace net income (loss) as the GAAP measure of our consolidated results of operations. Income from operations is an internal measure used by the company in the management of its operations. Management believes that this performance measure explains the results of the company's ongoing operations in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's current business because the excluded items are either unpredictable and/or not related to decisions regarding the underlying businesses.
