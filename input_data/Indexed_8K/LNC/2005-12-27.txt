Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 23, 2005, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Citicorp North America Inc., as syndication agent, and the other lenders named therein (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is a new 364-day facility that allows for borrowing of up to $2.3 billion and is unsecured.
If we make a drawdown under the Credit Facility, we may only use the proceeds of the loan:
Loans under the Credit Facility may be made either at a LIBOR rate plus 0.23% or the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus  of 1% or JPMorgan Chases prime rate. Under the Credit Facility, we are required to pay certain fees, including a facility fee of 0.02% of the aggregate commitment, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears.
If any loans under the Credit Facility are outstanding when we complete any offerings for our debt or capital stock, we must use all of the net proceeds of any such offering to first reduce the loans outstanding prior to using the net proceeds for any other purpose.
The Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant regarding maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth, and covenants restricting the Companys ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where it is not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. Further, the Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default. The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, certain cross-defaults, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the Credit Facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable.
The foregoing description of the Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Credit Facility, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

(b)
 
Not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (or 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) in the case of any Base Rate Borrowing) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01.

(d)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount.

(b)
 
the Required Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the LIBO Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Unless the Company notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Euro-Dollar Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Company shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Company shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

SECTION 8.03.
Increased Cost and Reduced Return
. (a) If on or after (x) the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(b)
 
If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction.

(c)
 
Each Bank will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and, in reasonable detail, such Bank's computation of such amount or amounts, shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
SECTION 8.04.

The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section), whether or not correctly or legally imposed, paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. In addition, the Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for all Domestic Taxes of such Bank or the Administrative Agent (calculated based on a hypothetical basis at the maximum marginal rate for a corporation) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses to the extent not attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of each Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case to the extent that such Domestic Taxes result from any payment or indemnification pursuant to this Section for any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction for which the Company is responsible under Sections 8.05(a), (b) or (c). This indemnification shall be paid within 30 days after such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, makes demand therefor.

Each Bank which so delivers a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI further undertakes to deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Company and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Company or the Administrative Agent with the appropriate form as required by Section 8.05(d) (whether or not such Bank is lawfully able to do so, unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.05(b) or (c) with respect to any withholding of the United States federal income tax;
provided
that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.
 
(f)
 
If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section as a result of a change of law occurring after the date hereof, then such Bank, at the request of the Company, will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the sole judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
 
(g)
 
Each Bank and the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company, use reasonable efforts (consistent with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested by the Company if the making of such a filing would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts payable to or for the account of such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) pursuant to this Section which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole judgment of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, require such Bank or the Administrative Agent to disclose any confidential or proprietary information or be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank or the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.06.

For so long as any Bank maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of such Bank to United States residents), and as a result the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining its Euro-Dollar Loans is increased, then such Bank may require the Company to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one
minus
the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable LIBO Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Company and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall furnish to the Company at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans an officer's certificate setting forth the amount to which such Bank is then entitled under this Section (which shall be consistent with such Bank's good faith estimate of the level at which the related reserves are maintained by it). Each such certificate shall be accompanied by such information as the Company may reasonably request as to the computation set forth therein.

SECTION 9.02.
No Waivers
. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

SECTION 9.03.
Expenses; Indemnification; Non-Liability of Banks

provided
that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Company other than its indebtedness under the Notes. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.
