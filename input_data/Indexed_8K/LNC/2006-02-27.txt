After the Election Deadline, a holder of Jefferson-Pilot shares may not change an election and may not withdraw his/her stock certificate(s) unless the Merger Agreement is terminated.
All Forms of Election and Letters of Transmittal will be void and of no effect if the merger is not completed for any reason and any Jefferson-Pilot stock certificates submitted therewith will be returned promptly after the Merger Agreement is terminated.
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR SHARES
Shown above Box 1 of the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal are the registration number of your account and the number of shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock you own as reflected on the records of Jefferson-Pilot on February 15, 2006. Your total number of shares held in certificated form is shown on the left and the number of shares held for you in book-entry form ( non-certificated form), including any shares held in Jefferson-Pilot's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, is shown on the right above your name and address.
i.e.
If your stock certificate(s) is/are lost, missing or destroyed, please immediately contact Wachovia Bank, N.A., Jefferson-Pilot's Transfer Agent, by telephone at 1-800-829-8432 or by email at equityservices@wachovia.com and provide your account name, address and daytime telephone number for instructions on how to replace your Jefferson-Pilot stock certificate(s).

JEFFERSON-PILOT DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN PARTICIPANTS
Any reference to the term "certificate" means Jefferson-Pilot common shares held in certificate form. Shares held for you in Jefferson-Pilot's Dividend Reinvestment Plan are held as book-entry; therefore, you will not have any certificates to surrender for these shares. However, you should still complete the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal as explained below. If you do not, your book-entry shares will be Non-Election Shares and you probably will receive the form of merger consideration that electing shareholders do not prefer.
REQUIRED SIGNATURES AND ELECTION OPTIONS (BOXES 1-5)
The terms of the Merger Agreement allow you to choose, subject to certain limitations, the type of consideration you receive for each of your shares. For more information, please refer to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Regardless of the option you choose, your stock certificate(s), if any, must be returned with the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal for your election to be valid. You will not have stock certificates for any shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock held for you in book-entry form, including shares in Jefferson-Pilot's Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
 
Please be sure to include your daytime telephone number.

If you have a Taxpayer Identification Number ("") as of the date you make your election, that the TIN printed on the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal is correct, or provide your correct TIN in the space provided in Box 2 of the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal.

If you do not have a TIN as of the date you make the election you should not complete Box 2.
If you do not have a TIN as of the date you make the election but you have filed for a TIN or will file for a TIN in the near future, you must complete and sign the Substitute W-9 for Taxpayers Awaiting a Taxpayer Identification Number provided in this instruction booklet rather than the Substitute W-9 in Box 2.
In each case, regardless of whether you have previously furnished a TIN or the certification on Form W-9 with respect to dividend payments, you must again furnish this number on the Substitute Form W-9 Certification provided in Box 2 of the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal or in the Substitute W-9 for Taxpayers Awaiting a Taxpayer Identification Number included in this instruction booklet, as may be applicable.
Shareholders should refer to the in this instruction booklet for more detailed information on how to complete these Forms. In particular, if a stock certificate(s) is in more than one name or is not in the name of the actual owner, consult the instructions provided herein and the enclosed for additional guidance on which number to report.

VALIDITY OF SURRENDER; IRREGULARITIES
Any disputes regarding your election or the elections made by other Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will be resolved by the Exchange Agent (in consultation with Lincoln) and its decision will be final for all parties concerned. The Exchange Agent has the right, subject to reasonable discretion, to reject any and all Forms of Election and Letters of Transmittal which it determines are not in proper form. Surrenders of stock certificate(s) will not be effective until all defects or irregularities that have not been waived by Lincoln have been corrected. Neither the Exchange Agent nor Lincoln is under any
 
obligation to provide notification of any defects in the deposit and surrender of any certificate(s) formerly representing Jefferson-Pilot shares, nor shall the Exchange Agent or Lincoln be liable for any failure to give any such notification. Please return your Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal promptly to allow sufficient time to correct any possible deficiencies before the Election Deadline.

1. When will the merger be completed?
The companies presently expect that the merger will become effective at the beginning of April 2006. Each company will hold a special meeting of its shareholders on March 20, 2006, and we expect to receive all of the required regulatory approvals by the end of March. Based on this timetable, the Election Deadline for Jefferson-Pilot shareholders will be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, March 28, 2006. If the Election Deadline changes due to a change in the expected effective time of the merger, Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot will provide information regarding the revised dates in a joint press release. You may also obtain up-to-date information regarding the Election Deadline by calling Mellon Investor Services LLC at 1-866-293-5636.
2. What will I receive in exchange for my Jefferson-Pilot shares upon completion of the merger?
You have the opportunity to elect to receive, for each share of Jefferson-Pilot common stock that you own:
 
 
Because of the proration procedures described in Question 9 below, you may not receive exactly what you elect.
3. Do I have to make the same election with respect to all of the Jefferson-Pilot shares that I own?
No. You may elect to receive cash for some of your shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock by specifying in the space
provided in Box 5 on the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal the number of shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock with respect to which you want to make a cash election. Your remaining surrendered Jefferson-Pilot shares will be automatically elected for Lincoln common stock.
4. I have received more than one set of Election Materials in connection with the election. Do I need to complete them all?
Yes. If you received more than one set of Election Materials, this indicates that you own stock in more than one manner or you own stock in more than one name. For example, you may have shares registered directly with Jefferson-Pilot; you may own Jefferson-Pilot shares through a third party, such as a broker or the administrator of Jefferson-Pilot's Dividend Reinvestment Plan; or you may own shares in both single name and joint name. Each set of Election Materials you receive should be specific to the manner in which you hold your Jefferson-Pilot shares.
Failure to complete one of the Forms of Election and Letters of Transmittal means that no election will be made with respect to the shares to which that Form applies.
5. Do I have to send in the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal if all of my shares are held in Jefferson-Pilot's Dividend Reinvestment Plan?
Yes, if you want to elect the form of merger consideration that you will receive in the merger, you must properly complete and return the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent before the Election Deadline. If you do not do this, you will receive the merger consideration paid to non-election shares.
 
6. Will I receive any fractional shares?
No fractional shares of Lincoln common stock will be delivered in the merger for certificated shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock. Instead, you will be entitled to receive cash, without interest, for any fractional share of Lincoln common stock you might otherwise have been entitled to receive, based on the closing price of Lincoln common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day immediately before the merger.
7. How do I make an election if I hold my shares through a broker, bank or other nominee?
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, they must make an election for your shares on your behalf in accordance with your instructions. Please instruct them on what election you want them to make for your shares by completing the election instructions that you receive from them.
8. When is my Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal due?
Your Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal and your Jefferson-Pilot stock certificate(s), if any, must be by the Exchange Agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC, by the Election Deadline, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 28, 2006, unless extended by Lincoln and Jefferson-Pilot. Any change to the Election Deadline will be announced in a joint press release.
RECEIVED
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must return your election instructions to them by their deadline, which is probably earlier than the Election Deadline. Please refer to the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.
9. Am I guaranteed to receive the Lincoln common stock or cash I ask for
on the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal?
No. Elections will be limited by the requirement that the amount of cash exchanged for shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock must equal $1.8 billion. Accordingly, the total number of Jefferson-Pilot shares that will be exchanged for cash will total approximately 32 million shares ($1.8 billion total cash/$55.96 cash per share). As a result, Section 2.1 of the Merger Agreement describes proration procedures to be followed in the event that Jefferson-Pilot shareholders elect to receive more or less cash in exchange for the common stock than is required under the Merger Agreement. Thus, even if you make a valid election, you may not receive exactly the form of consideration that you request. The proration procedures referenced in this paragraph are explained in detail under the caption "The Merger AgreementElections" beginning on page 99 of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, dated February 9, 2006, previously delivered to you.
The exact allocation of merger consideration will depend in part on the aggregate elections of the other Jefferson-Pilot shareholders. If you elect to receive cash and the aggregate amount of cash elected by all Jefferson-Pilot shareholders is more than $1.8 billion, or if you elect to receive Lincoln common stock and the aggregate amount of cash elected or deemed elected by Jefferson-Pilot shareholders is less than $1.8 billion, you will receive some of the merger consideration in the form you did not elect.
10. What happens if I do not make an election, fail to sign or make more than one election on the Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal or miss the Election Deadline?
If you do not make an election, fail to sign or otherwise properly complete or make more than one election on the
 
For these non-election shares, you will receive cash consideration, stock consideration or a combination of both, depending upon the elections made by other Jefferson-Pilot shareholders and the proration procedures.
Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal or miss the Election Deadline, your shares will be deemed non-election shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Following the completion of the merger, if you hold Jefferson-Pilot stock certificates, you will receive a separate Letter of Transmittal if you have not previously submitted your stock certificates and any other necessary documentation. You must submit your Jefferson-Pilot stock certificates in order to receive your merger consideration.
11. How do I elect merger consideration for Jefferson-Pilot common shares allocated to my account in Jefferson-Pilot's 401(k)/TeamShare Plan or Agents' Retirement Plan?
You will receive a separate packet of information describing the procedures that must be followed to elect Lincoln common stock, cash, or a combination of Lincoln common stock and cash for the Jefferson-Pilot common shares allocated to your account in Jefferson-Pilot's 401(k)/ TeamShare Plan or Agents' Retirement Plan. You must follow the procedures set forth in those instructions for making an election of merger consideration with respect to such shares.
12. Can I revoke or change my election?
You may revoke or change your Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal by submitting written notice to the Exchange Agent. To change your election, you must submit a new properly completed Form of Election and Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent
must receive this new form on or before the Election Deadline. You may revoke your election and receive your shares back by providing the Exchange Agent with a written notice of revocation. This written notice of revocation must be received by the Exchange Agent before the Election Deadline.
