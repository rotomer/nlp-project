Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 13, 2006, we entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, Citibank, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and The Bank of New York, as documentation agents, and the other lenders named therein (the Amended Credit Facility). The Amended Credit Facility, dated and effective as of March 10, 2006, amends and restates the Companys letter of credit facility dated December 10, 2004 and replaces the Companys revolving credit facility dated December 10, 2004. The Amended Credit Facility has a five year term, allows for borrowing or issuance of letters of credit of up to $1.5 billion and is unsecured. Letters of credit under the Amended Credit Facility primarily secure reinsurance liabilities of our insurance subsidiaries. We guarantee our insurance subsidiaries reimbursement to the lenders of any disbursements made under outstanding letters of credit. As of March 10, 2006, the aggregate face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility is approximately $848.5 million.
Loans under the Amended Credit Facility may be made either at a LIBOR rate plus 0.15% or the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus  of 1% or JPMorgan Chases prime rate. Under the Amended Credit Facility, we are required to pay certain fees, including a facility fee of 0.05% of the aggregate commitment, which fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The LIBOR rate spread, letter of credit fee and facility fee adjust automatically in the event of a change in our credit ratings.
The Amended Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant regarding maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth, and covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Further, the Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default. The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, certain cross-defaults, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the Amended Credit Facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated, any outstanding letter of credit may be drawn upon (if permitted under such letter of credit) and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable.
The foregoing description of the Amended Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Amended Credit Facility, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Certain lenders under the Amended Credit Facility or their affiliates perform other services for our subsidiaries and us from time to time in the normal course of business, including providing custodial, cash management and transfer agent services, merger and acquisition/investment banking advice and underwriting of capital market transactions. In addition, certain lenders under the Amended Credit Facility or their affiliates act as distributors of various life, annuity and investment products of our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

Provision of Cover
. In the event the Company and the Account Parties shall have provided cover for outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 6.01, the Administrative Agent will establish a separate cash collateral account (the "
Collateral Account
"), which may be a "securities account" (as defined in Section 8-501 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in New York (the "
NY UCC
")), in the name and under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of a securities account, in respect of which the Administrative Agent is the "entitlement holder" (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(7) of the NY UCC)) into which there shall be deposited from time to time such amounts paid to the Administrative Agent as cover for the applicable LC Exposure.

Secured Obligations
"), each of the Company and the other Account Parties hereby pledges and grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Banks and the Administrative Agent as provided herein, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Collateral Account (including the investments and reinvestments therein provided for below). The balances from time to time in the Collateral Account shall not constitute payment of any Secured Obligations until applied by the Administrative Agent as provided herein. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, funds held in the Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided in this Section 2.03(e). Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested and reinvested by the Administrative Agent in such short-term Investments as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion. All such investments and reinvestments shall be held in the name and be under the sole dominion control of the Administrative Agent and shall be credited to the Collateral Account. At any time, and from time to time, while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, if instructed by the Required Banks in their sole discretion, liquidate any such investments and reinvestments and credit the proceeds thereof to the Collateral Account and apply or cause to be applied such proceeds and any other balances in the Collateral Account to the payment of any of the Secured Obligations due and payable. If at any time (i) no Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) all of the Secured Obligations then due have been paid in full but Letters of Credit remain outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, at the request of the Company, deliver to the Company, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, such of the balances in the Collateral Account as exceed the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit. When all of the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit have expired or been terminated and the Commitments have terminated, the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to the Company, for account of the Company and the other Account Parties, as applicable, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, the balances remaining in the Collateral Account.

SECTION 8.01.
Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Borrowing:
 
(a)
 
the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(b)
 
the Required Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the LIBO Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended. Unless the Company notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.
 
SECTION 8.02.

Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Company shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Company shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

SECTION 8.03.
Increased Cost and Reduced Return
. (a) If on or after the date hereof, in the case of any Loan or any obligation to make Loans or in the case of any Letter of Credit or any obligation to issue, participate in, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans or its obligation to issue or participate in Letters of Credit, any outstanding Letters of Credit or reimbursement claims in respect of LC Disbursements and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan or of issuing, participating in or maintaining any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under other Credit Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(b)
 
If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction.

(c)
 
Each Bank will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and, in reasonable detail, such Bank's computation of such amount or amounts, shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
SECTION 8.04.
Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans
. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or continue Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03(a) or 8.05 and the Company shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:
 
(a)
 
all Loans which would otherwise be made, or continued, by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as, or converted into, Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and
 
(b)
 
after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

Taxes
. (a) For purposes of this Section, the following terms have the following meanings:

Taxes
" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings of any nature with respect to any payment by any Account Party or the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located (all such excluded taxes being hereinafter referred to as "
Domestic Taxes
"). If the form provided by a Bank pursuant to Section 8.05(d) at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, any United States interest withholding tax at such rate imposed on payments by the Company under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be excluded from the definition of "Taxes".
 
"
Other Taxes
" means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document.
 
(b)
 
Any and all payments by any Account Party or the Guarantor to or for the account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that, if any Account Party or the Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) such Account Party or the Guarantor (as the case may be) shall make such deductions or withholdings, (iii) such Account Party or the Guarantor (as the case may be) shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) such Account Party or the Guarantor (as the case may be) shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, and, if such receipt relates to Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of a sum payable to any Bank, the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver such original or certified copy to such Bank.
 
 
-58-
 
(c)
 
The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section), whether or not correctly or legally imposed, paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. In addition, the Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for all Domestic Taxes of such Bank or the Administrative Agent (calculated based on a hypothetical basis at the maximum marginal rate for a corporation) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses to the extent not attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of each Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case to the extent that such Domestic Taxes result from any payment or indemnification pursuant to this Section for any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction for which the Company or any Account Party is responsible under Sections 8.05(a), (b) or (c). This indemnification shall be paid within 30 days after such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, makes demand therefor.
 
(d)
 
At least five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Bank which so delivers a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI further undertakes to deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Company and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
 
(e)
 
For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Company or the Administrative Agent with the appropriate form as required by Section 8.05(d) (whether or not such Bank is lawfully able to do so, unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.05(b) or (c) with respect to any withholding of the United States federal income tax;
provided
that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.
 
 
-59-
 
(f)
 
If any Account Party or the Guarantor is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section as a result of a change of law occurring after the date hereof, then such Bank, at the request of the Company, will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the sole judgment of such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
 
(g)
 
Each Bank and the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company, use reasonable efforts (consistent with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested by the Company if the making of such a filing would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts payable to or for the account of such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) pursuant to this Section which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole judgment of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, require such Bank or the Administrative Agent to disclose any confidential or proprietary information or be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank or the Administrative Agent.
 
(h)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall interfere with the rights of any Bank to conduct its fiscal or tax affairs in such manner as it deems fit.
 
SECTION 8.06.
Regulation D Compensation
. For so long as any Bank maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of such Bank to United States residents), and as a result the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining its Euro-Dollar Loans is increased, then such Bank may require the Company to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one
minus
the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable LIBO Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Company and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall furnish to the Company at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans an officer's certificate setting forth the amount to which such Bank is then entitled under this Section (which shall be consistent with such Bank's good faith estimate of the level at which the related reserves are maintained by it). Each such certificate shall be accompanied by such information as the Company may reasonably request as to the computation set forth therein.

The Company shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including fees and disbursements of counsel including costs allocated to in-house counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.
 
(b)
 
The Company agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Bank and each Confirming Bank, their Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents, advisors and employees of the foregoing (each an "
Indemnitee
") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and costs of settlement, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans or of the Letters of Credits;
provided
that no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or for the breach by such Indemnitee of its obligations hereunder or, in the case of a Confirming Bank, under its Confirming Bank Agreement.
 
SECTION 10.04.
Sharing of Set-Offs

provided
that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the applicable Account Party other than its indebtedness under this Agreement. Each Account Party agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in any Loan or LC Exposure, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 10.05.
Amendments and Waivers
. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by each Account Party and the Required Banks or by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Required Banks) (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Fronting Issuing Bank, in such capacity, are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent or any Fronting Issuing Bank, as the case may be);

provided
,
further
, that the consent of 100% of the Banks shall be required with respect to (x) any change in the percentage of the Commitments or of the Credit Exposure, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement, (y) the release of any of the collateral provided for cover of the LC Exposure pursuant to Sections 2.03(e) and 6.01 other than as expressly provided in Section 2.03(e) or (z) any change in the obligations of the Company under Article IX.

SECTION 10.06.
Successors and Assigns
.
 
(a)
 
The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
provided
,
however
, that no Account Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Banks.
 
(b)
 
Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each a "
Participant
") participating interests in its Commitment or the Loans or any or all of its Letters of Credit. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Account Parties hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (x), (y) or (z) of Section 10.05 without the consent of the Participant. Each Account Party agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).
 
(c)
 
Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more NAIC Approved Banks (each an "
Assignee
") all, or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided
that (i) if an Assignee is an Affiliate of any Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent of the Company shall be required and (ii) if an Assignee was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, no such consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required;
provided
,
further
, that if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing under Section 6.01(a), 6.01(g) or 6.01(h) with respect to the Company, no such consent of the Company shall be required; and
provided
,
further
, that any such assignment (other than an assignment to another Bank or an Affiliate of any Bank or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the transferor Bank's Commitment and interests in outstanding Loans and Letters of Credit) shall be in an amount that is at least $5,000,000 unless otherwise agreed by the Account Parties and the Administrative Agent. Upon execution and delivery of such Assignment and Assumption and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank or Assignee shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.05(d).

(d)
 
Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to any Person to secure obligations of such Bank, including, without limitation, to one or more of the Federal Reserve Banks which comprise the Federal Reserve System. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.
 
(e)
 
No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 8.03, 8.05 or 8.06 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made (i) with the Company's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.05 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or (ii) at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.
 
SECTION 10.07.
