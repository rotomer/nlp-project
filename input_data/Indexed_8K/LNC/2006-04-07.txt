Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
A. On April 3, 2006, we completed the merger of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, a North Carolina corporation ("Jefferson-Pilot"), with and into Lincoln JP Holdings, L.P., an Indiana limited partnership and wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation ("LNC"), as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 9, 2005, as amended as of January 26, 2006 (the "merger agreement"), by and among LNC, Jefferson-Pilot, Lincoln JP Holdings, L.P and Quartz Corporation, a North Carolina corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of LNC (the "merger").
 
As a result of the Merger, certain management contracts and various compensatory contracts, plans and arrangements of Jefferson-Pilot now apply to directors and/or executive officers of LNC. These contracts, plans and arrangements are generally described below.
 
Dennis R. Glass, our President and Chief Operating Officer and a director, was previously Jefferson-Pilot's Chief Executive Officer and a member of its board of directors. Mr. Glass's employment agreement with Jefferson-Pilot, which is effective through March 1, 2008, provides for base salary, annual bonus, stock options, LTIP payouts and certain benefits. If Mr. Glass's employment is terminated without good cause or if he resigns for good reason (as specified in the agreement), he will receive a lump sum payment equal to the annual base salary and 50% of the maximum bonus and long-term incentive payments that he would have received if his employment had continued until March 1, 2008, and he will be eligible for immediate retirement with benefits computed as if his employment had continued until March 1, 2008. As the merger is likely to be viewed as a change of control under Mr. Glass's employment agreement, if Mr. Glass's employment was terminated without good cause or he resigned as of December 31, 2005, he would be entitled to these benefits. However, he would not receive duplicative payments under these provisions and under the Executive Change in Control Severance Plan described below.
 
Jefferson-Pilot's Executive Change in Control Severance Plan, or severance plan, provides for the payment of severance benefits to its current executive officers and certain other officers following a change in control. Payments under the severance plan are triggered in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment, including the termination of an officer's employment without "cause" or "disability" or by the officer with "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the severance plan) in connection on or within two years following a change in control. Good reason includes any reduction in salary and benefits, or any significant reduction in annual bonus and long term incentive plan payments except for variations related to corporate and business unit performance. Cause includes willful misconduct or conviction for a felony.
 
If a qualifying termination occurs, the severance plan provides for lump sum severance payments equal to two or three times (as specified for each participant) the sum of the officer's annual base salary at termination or, if higher, at the beginning of the year in which the change in control occurred, and the higher of the accrued or target annual bonuses and long-term incentive payments averaged over the immediately preceding three full years. An additional amount also
would be paid to cover any applicable excise tax on all benefits received as the result of a change in control and any income taxes imposed on this excise tax payment, so that the net amount retained by the officer would equal the amount he or she would have received absent any such excise tax. The severance plan also provides for certain other benefits including continued employee benefits coverage and pension accruals and early vesting of executive supplemental retirement benefits if a qualifying termination occurs. The plan was amended to delay the payments of benefits for six months with interest at an annual rate of 10%, and to provide that any benefits provided under any separation pay plan would be offset against benefits otherwise payable under the severance plan (reducing the interest).
 
Jefferson-Pilot's Separation Pay Plan, covering executives and other officers, does not provide any additional benefits for executives above those in the severance plan but permits payment of benefits in the first six months following severance, not to exceed two times the lesser of (i) the officer's annual compensation for the prior calendar year or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17).
 
Jefferson-Pilot had stock option plans under which options have been granted to directors and to executive officers and others. Such options outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to April 3, 2006 remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were previously in effect, except that each of these stock options is now exercisable for LNC common stock equal to the number of shares of Jefferson-Pilot common stock subject to such option multiplied by 1.0906 (rounded down to the nearest whole share), with the exercise price determined by dividing that price by 1.0906 (rounded up to the sixth decimal place). Each unvested Jefferson-Pilot stock option held by an employee, officer or director and granted prior to October 9, 2005 (which was the date we signed the merger agreement) and outstanding on April 3 became fully vested and exercisable in connection with the merger. Options granted starting October 9 did not vest upon the merger, except for Jefferson-Pilot directors who have not become LNC directors, but will vest if an individual's job is eliminated or he or she is terminated without cause within two years of April 3, 2006.
 
If Jefferson-Pilot's Supplemental Benefit Plan provides pension benefits above the federal limits on payments from the tax-qualified plan, including an Executive Special Supplemental Benefit Plan for executive officers and other senior officers, providing for annual benefits of 2.5% of average final compensation (salary plus annual bonus) times the number of years of Jefferson-Pilot service.
 
Under Jefferson-Pilot's fee deferral plan for non-employee directors, some directors' fees have been deferred in phantom Jefferson-Pilot stock units, with dividend equivalents periodically credited. Upon the merger, units were converted into LNC phantom stock units at the merger exchange rate of 1.0906. Deferred accounts are unfunded and are paid out in shares of common stock in up to ten annual installments after the director leaves the board. A grantor trust buys in the open market and holds Jefferson-Pilot common stock equal to the phantom units in deferred fee accounts.
The preceding is qualified in its entirety by reference to the various compensatory contracts, plans and arrangements which are listed as Exhibits to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
B. Effective April 3, 2006, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted 6,000 shares of restricted stock, which fully vest in three years, to Frederick J. Crawford, Senior Vice President and CFO, Barbara Kowalczyk, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Dennis L. Schoff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. A form of our restricted stock grant agreement under the Lincoln National Corporation Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.15 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On April 3, 2006, we issued $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due April 6, 2009 ("Floating Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 6.15% Senior Notes due April 6, 2036 (the "Fixed Rate Notes," and together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to a Prospectus Supplement dated April 3, 2006 to the Prospectus dated March 14, 2006, filed as part of our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-132416; effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462(e) of Regulation C of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, as amended) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We sold the Notes pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") among us, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement. The Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Rate Notes were sold to the underwriters at prices of 99.750% and 98.461%, respectively. The Notes were issued under an Indenture relating to Senior Debt Securities, dated as of September 15, 1994 between Lincoln and The Bank of New York, as trustee.
 
From time to time, certain of the underwriters have provided, and may provide, various financial advisory or investment banking services to us and our affiliates, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of Banc of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia acted as lenders under the bridge facility used to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with the merger of Jefferson-Pilot into a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. In addition, affiliates of Banc of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, The Bank of New York, UBS, and Wachovia have acted as lenders in a $1.0 billion new line capacity and affiliates of ABN Amro, Banc of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Comerica, Fifth Third, Greenwich Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, KeyBanc, Lehman Brothers, Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, National City, Northern Trust, PNC, SG Americas Securities, The Bank of New York, Wachovia and Wells Fargo have acted as lenders in a $1.5 billion amendment to existing lines of credit. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers acted as merger and acquisition advisors to us and Morgan Stanley acted as merger and acquisition advisor to Jefferson-Pilot in our merger with Jefferson-Pilot and provided fairness opinions on that transaction. We have executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs. In addition to the underwriters participating in the expected offering of capital securities, the underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of business, including acting as distributors of various life, annuity and investment products of our subsidiaries.
 
The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and Notes, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement
attached as Exhibit 1.1 and the Notes attached as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 and each is incorporated herein by reference as though it were fully set forth herein.

Agreements

(A)
                             
 
Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus and will not provide additional information to the Commission relating to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review and provided you with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposed amendment, supplement, or information prior to filing or submitting the same and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement and will not submit such additional information to which you reasonably object. The Company will promptly advise the Underwriters and will promptly confirm such advice in writing (i) when the Prospectus shall have been filed (or transmitted for filing) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

(a)

(c)
         
 
If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by such Underwriter specifically for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(a)
                                 
provided
however
Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by such Underwriter or by any of the Representatives specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(b)
                                
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so as to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), approved by the Underwriters in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the
(c)
                                 
provided
however
indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such
(d)
                                
pro rata
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters for Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
8.
                                      
Default by an Underwriter
 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(b)
                                
pro
rata
 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and
(c)
                                 
the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock or any preferred stock or preferred securities shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in markets in the United States or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner contemplated.

Termination
 
. The respective agreement, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
[Reverse of Note]
 
LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION
 
Floating Rate Senior Note due 2009
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company of a series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of September 15, 1994 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holder of the Securities and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which different series may vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities of the Company designated as its Floating Rate Notes due 2009 (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Notes of this series are issuable in registered form only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
 
Three-month LIBOR ("LIBOR") will be determined by The Bank of New York or a successor financial institution appointed by the Company for such purpose, as calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), in accordance with the following provisions:
 
(a)           For each Interest Period, on the applicable Interest Determination Date (as defined below), the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR for such Interest Period.  LIBOR will be the offered rate (expressed as an interest rate per annum) for three-month U.S. dollar deposits in amounts of at least $1,000,000 which appears on Telerate Page 3750, as of approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.  "Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as Page "3750" on the Moneyline Telerate Inc. (or such other page as may replace page 3750 on that service or such other service).
 
(b)           If, on any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR cannot be determined pursuant to  (a) above, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page ("BBAM").
 
(c)           If no offered rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 or BBAM on any Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, then the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date
 
and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable Interest Period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are not provided, LIBOR will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current Interest Period.
 
Accrued interest on the Notes will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Notes by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in an Interest Period. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. The interest rate in effect on any Floating Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date.  The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Floating Interest Reset Date, or if none, the initial floating interest rate.  The "Floating Interest Reset Dates" are January 6, April 6, July 6 and October 6 of each year, commencing July 6, 2006.  If any Floating Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a London Business Day, such Floating Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding London Business Day, except that if such London Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Floating Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding London Business Day.  All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on a Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to .00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
 
For the purposes of calculating LIBOR, "Interest Determination Date" for any Interest Period means the second London Business Day preceding the Interest Payment Date commencing such Interest Period.
 
Upon request from any Holder of Notes, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate in effect for the Notes for the current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period.  Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
Interest on the Notes will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the applicable period divided by 360. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Company, absent manifest error.
 
The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.  If an Event of Default shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the Notes, upon which the Company, at its option, shall be deemed to have been Discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes or shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected by such amendment or supplement voting as one class. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency. Subject to certain exceptions, any past default or Event of Default may be waived by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series affected on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of that series or the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Outstanding Securities voting as one class. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or upon any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for transfer at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, this Note or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in any manner in respect hereof, or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitutional provision or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or in any other manner, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
 
All capitalized terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
[Reverse of Note]
 
LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION 6.15% Senior Notes due 2036
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company of a series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of September 15, 1994 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holder of the Securities and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which different series may vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities of the Company designated as its 6.15% Senior Notes due 2036 (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Notes of this series are issuable in registered form only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
 
The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, upon mailed notice to the registered address of each holder of Notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. The redemption price will be the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the make-whole amount, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. "Make-whole amount" means the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on the Notes, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points. The make-whole amount will be determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below).
 
"Calculation Agent" means the entity appointed by the Company to determine the make-whole amount owed upon the redemption of the Notes, whether in whole or in part, by the Company.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by a reference treasury dealer as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes called for redemption, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities with a term comparable to such period.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to a redemption date (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the
Calculation Agent obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and (2) any additional primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "primary treasury dealer") selected by the Company and their successors, provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a primary treasury dealer the Company will substitute another primary treasury dealer.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Calculation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Calculation Agent at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes called for redemption that would be due after the related redemption date but for that redemption. If that redemption date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to the Notes called for redemption, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on such Notes will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the comparable treasury price for that redemption date.
 
The Company will prepare and mail a notice of redemption to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. On and after a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before a redemption date, the Company will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro rata or by lot or by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
 
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund.  If an Event of Default shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the Notes, upon which the Company, at its option, shall be deemed to have been Discharged from its
obligations with respect to the Notes or shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected by such amendment or supplement voting as one class. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency. Subject to certain exceptions, any past default or Event of Default may be waived by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series affected on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of that series or the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Outstanding Securities voting as one class. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or upon any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for transfer at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge will be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, this Note or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in any manner in respect hereof, or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitutional provision or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or in any other manner, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
 
All capitalized terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Lincoln National Corporation, an Indiana corporation ("Lincoln"), in connection with the public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.15% Senior Notes due 2036 (the "Fixed Rate
Notes," and together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes") issued pursuant to the Indenture dated September 15, 1994 (the "Indenture") by and between Lincoln and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee").  This opinion is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined: (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132416); (ii) the prospectus dated March 14, 2006, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as part of the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"), together with the prospectus supplement relating to the Notes dated April 3, 2006, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the supplement to the Prospectus Supplement dated April 6, 2006, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act (the Base Prospectus, together with the Prospectus Supplement and such supplement, the "Prospectus"); (iii) an executed copy of the Indenture; (iv) the forms of the Notes; (v) the Articles of Incorporation of Lincoln, as amended to the date hereof; (vi) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Lincoln as currently in effect;  (vii) the Underwriting Agreement, dated April 3, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") by and between Lincoln and the underwriters named in Schedule I
 
Lincoln National Corporation

thereto (the "Underwriters"); and (viii) the resolutions of the Board of Directors of Lincoln and the Securities Committee and the Committee on Corporate Action thereof relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes and related matters.  We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of Lincoln and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of Lincoln and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
We have assumed without investigation the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to authentic originals of all items submitted to us as copies and the genuineness of all signatures on such originals or copies. We have assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons that all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto have been organized and are validly existing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, and, with respect to all such parties other than Lincoln, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate and otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been authorized by all requisite action (corporate and otherwise), and executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon statements of fact contained in the documents that we have examined and upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Lincoln and others.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein and subject to the completion of the proceedings to be taken by Lincoln, the Trustee and the Underwriters prior to the sale of the Notes, it is our opinion that the Notes, when duly executed, authenticated, issued, delivered and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued and binding obligations of Lincoln.
 
Our opinion is subject to: (i) the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement and other laws affecting creditor's rights generally, including, without limitation, the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers; (ii)  general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief (regardless of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) our assumption that there exist no agreements, understandings or negotiations among the parties to the Indenture or the Underwriting Agreement that would modify the terms of any thereof or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
We express no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the General Rules and Regulations thereunder.  This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. This opinion speaks as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable law or the interpretation thereof.
 
 

Exhibit 10.14
 
1. Eligibility.
 
Each member of the Board of Directors of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (the "Corporation") who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries ("Eligible Director") is eligible to participate in this Deferred Fee Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan").
 
2. Participation.
 
(a)  For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, an Eligible Director may elect, at the times specified in Section 2(b) and (c), to defer the receipt of all or part of the annual retainer and various meeting fees which would otherwise have been payable currently for services as a Director of the Corporation ("Fees"). Deferred Fees shall be credited to a deferred fee account (a bookkeeping account) subject to the terms of the Plan.
 
(b)  An election to defer Fees must be made by December 31 to be effective for the next calendar year, and shall be irrevocable for such calendar year.
st
 
Any person who first becomes an Eligible Director during a calendar year, may, within thirty days of the date he or she becomes an Eligible Director, elect to defer Fees for the current calendar year. Any such election shall be irrevocable for the remainder of such calendar year.
(c)
                                 
 
An election to defer fees must be made on a form provided by the Corporation and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation (the "Secretary").
(d)
                                
 
3. Deferred Fee Accounts.
 
Deferred amounts shall constitute an unsecured claim on the general assets of the Corporation. The amounts thereof shall be credited to the Director's account as of the date such amounts otherwise would have been paid to the Director, except that Fees for committee meetings not held on the date of a Board meeting shall be credited on the date of the next Board meeting.
(a)
                                 
 
The Director shall designate the portion of his or her deferrals to be "invested" in one or both investment options: an interest rate and phantom stock.
(b)
                                
 
Deferrals under the interest rate option shall be credited with interest for each year at a rate equal to the average of the rate of interest on seven year U.S. Treasury obligations as of the end of each of the twenty-four months prior to such year.
(c)
                                 
 
Deferrals under the phantom stock option shall be credited to the Director's account in full and fractional units based on the fair market value of the common stock of the Corporation on the crediting date. Additional phantom units shall be credited equivalent to dividends paid on the common stock, based on the fair market value on the dividend payment date. Equitable adjustments shall be made to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or other relevant corporate change. Fair market value means (1) if and to the extent that the Corporation makes contributions to a Rabbi Trust as provided in Section 6(b) to purchase common stock on or about the date that Fees deferred hereunder
(d)
                                
are to be credited to Directors' accounts, or such a Trust receives dividends on common stock held by the Trust, the actual cost per share including commissions paid by the Trust or (ii) otherwise, the closing price of the common stock based upon its consolidated trading as generally reported for a given date, or if there is no reported trading for that date, such closing price for the immediately preceding trading day.
 
Diversification of amounts credited to accounts through any transfer between phantom stock units and the interest rate option shall not be permitted.
(e)
                                 
 
The Corporation shall maintain separate accounts for Fees deferred prior to December 31, 2004, including any gain or loss on such separate accounts after December 31, 2004. Such amounts shall not be subject to the requirements of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "ACT"), provided the Plan is not materially modified after October 3, 2004 (the "Grandfathered Amounts").
(f)
                                   
 
4. Payment.
 
All payments with respect to a Director's deferred account under the interest rate option shall be made in cash. All payments under the phantom stock option shall be made in shares of common stock. Phantom units shall be valued at the fair market value on the payment date, and cash shall be paid for any fractional share.
(a)
                                 
 
Grandfathered Amounts shall be paid out in ten annual installments, unless otherwise elected. The amount of each installment shall be a fraction of the value of the account at the end of the preceding year, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments minus the number previously paid. In the alternative, a Director may elect to receive payment in a lump sum or in
(b)
                                
some other number of equal annual installments not exceeding ten. Such election must be made at least one year prior to the date on which the Director ceases to be a Director.
 
For Fees deferred after December 31, 2004, the value of a Director's deferred account shall be paid out in ten annual installments, unless otherwise elected. The amount of each installment shall be a fraction of the value of the account at the end of the preceding year, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments minus the number previously paid. A Director may elect to receive payment in a lump sum or in some other number of equal annual installments not exceeding ten. If a separate payment election for Fees deferred after December 31, 2004 was not received by the Secretary of the Corporation by December 31, 2005, the payment election applicable to Fees deferred prior to December 31, 2004 shall be deemed to be the original election made by a Director. A Director may make only one subsequent election to change the form of the distribution (e.g., from installments to lump sum), or to delay the commencement of benefit payments. An election to change the payment option or re-defer payments must be made at least one year prior to the date on which the payments would otherwise have commenced, and must delay the starting date of the payments at least five years.
(c)
                                 
 
The first installment or the lump sum payment shall be paid on the first business day of the calendar year following the year in which the Director ceases to be a Director of the Corporation, and any subsequent installments shall be paid on the first business day of each succeeding calendar year until the entire account value is paid. For purposes of this paragraph, a Director has not ceased to be a Director of the Corporation if he or she remains a Director of the Corporation or becomes a Director of any
(d)
                                
corporation that, directly or indirectly, merges with, acquires or otherwise owns and controls more than fifty percent of the assets or common stock of the Corporation ("Successor Corporation").
 
If a Director dies before full payment of the account value, the balance shall be paid to the Director's estate or to a beneficiary or beneficiaries designated in writing by the Director, as the case may be, on the first business day of the calendar year following death.
(e)
                                 
 
Each participating Director may designate from time to time any person or persons, natural or otherwise, as his beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the amounts credited to his or her deferred account are to be paid if he or she dies before all such amounts have been paid. Each beneficiary designation shall be made on a form prescribed by the Corporation and shall be effective only when received by the Secretary during the participant's lifetime. Each beneficiary designation received by the Secretary shall revoke all beneficiary designations previously made. The revocation of a designation shall not require the consent of any beneficiary. In the absence of an effective beneficiary designation or if payment can be made to no beneficiary, payment shall be made to the participant's estate.
(f)
                                   
 
5. Administration.
 
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee appointed by the Corporation or any successor Corporation. The Committee shall have authority to adopt rules and regulations for carrying out the Plan and to interpret, construe and implement its
provisions. Decisions of the Committee shall be final and binding. Routine administration may be delegated by the Committee.
 
6. Miscellaneous.
 
The right of a Director or any beneficiary to his or her account under the Plan shall not be subject to assignment, alienation or pledge by the Director or beneficiary.
(a)
                                 
 
The Corporation shall not be required to reserve, or otherwise set aside, funds for the payment of its obligations under the Plan. The Corporation may establish one or more Rabbi Trusts, separately for phantom stock units and invested in common stock (as described in Section 3(d)), and for the interest rate option invested as the Corporation shall determine from time to time.
(b)
                                
 
The Director and his or her designated beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not have any property interest whatsoever in a deferred account, in any specific assets of the Corporation or in any Rabbi Trust assets. The right to receive payments under the Plan shall be a claim against the general assets of the Corporation as a general creditor.
(c)
                                 
 
All notices to the Corporation under the Plan shall be in writing and shall be given to the Secretary or to an agent or other person designated by the Secretary.
(d)
                                
 
The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding its choice of law provisions.

In addition, the Compensation Committee of the LNC Board of Directors may exercise its sole discretion to defer all or a portion of such Restricted Shares and the DER Account under the Deferred Compensation Plan if the Grantee is a Reporting Person under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Grantee's employer would be denied a tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for the value of such Restricted Shares and the DER Account.
 
8.       Grantee must remit to the Secretary of LNC an amount equal to any tax withholding required by federal, state, or local law on the value of the Restricted Shares and the DER Account at such time as they are taxable to Grantee. Grantee may elect, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, to surrender shares of LNC common stock (including the shares which are a part of this award) with a fair market value on the date of surrender that satisfies all or part of the withholding requirements.
