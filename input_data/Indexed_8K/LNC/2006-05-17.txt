Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 12, 2006, we issued $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 7% Capital Securities due May 17, 2066 (the "Capital Securities") pursuant to a Prospectus Supplement dated May 12, 2006 to the Prospectus dated March 14, 2006, filed as part of our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-132416; effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462(e) of Regulation C of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, as amended) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We sold the Capital Securities pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") among us, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement. The Capital Securities were sold to the underwriters at a price of $1,971.92 per security. The Capital Securities were issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1996, between us and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, National Association and The First National Bank of Chicago) (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 17, 2006 (the "Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture") between us and the Trustee.
From time to time, certain of the underwriters have provided, and may provide, various financial advisory or investment banking services to us and our affiliates, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of Banc of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia acted as lenders under the bridge facility used to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with the merger of Jefferson-Pilot into a wholly-owned subsidiary of LNC. In addition, affiliates of Banc of America, BNY Capital Markets, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Wachovia have acted as lenders in a $1.0 billion line capacity and affiliates of ABN AMRO, Banc of America, BNP Paribas, BNY Capital Markets, Citigroup, Comerica, Fifth Third, Greenwich Capital, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, KeyBanc, Lehman Brothers, Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, NatCity, PNC, SG Americas, Wachovia and Wells Fargo have acted as lenders in a $1.5 billion amendment to existing lines of credit. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers acted as merger and acquisition advisors to us and Morgan Stanley acted as merger and acquisition advisor to Jefferson-Pilot in our merger with Jefferson-Pilot and provided fairness opinions on that transaction. We have executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase with Goldman Sachs. In addition to certain of the underwriters participating in the recent offerings of senior notes and 6.75% capital securities, the underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of business, including acting as distributors of various life, annuity and investment products of our subsidiaries.
The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture and the Capital Securities, and is
 
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement attached as Exhibit 1.1, the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture attached as Exhibit 4.1 and the Form of Capital Securities attached as Exhibit 4.2 and each is incorporated herein by reference as though it were fully set forth herein.

(e) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
 
made when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(f) The Company will promptly from time to time arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities, and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise subject.
(g) Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Underwriters, offer, sell or contract to sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act.

(l) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing for a period of 30 days from the date hereof, the Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company or warrants to purchase or otherwise acquire debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Securities (other than (i) the Securities, (ii) commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business or (iii) securities or warrants permitted with the prior written consent of the Representatives).

,

(i) The Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits and security provided by the Indenture; and the Securities conform to the description thereof contained in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus;
(ii) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;

(iv) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(v) The statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under "Description of the Capital Securities", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
(vi) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity controlled by an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and
(vii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, and to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof, or any notice objecting to its use, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act; the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented and any further amendments thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (in each case other than the financial statements, financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief), appear on their face to be appropriate responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall also state that although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently, does not express an opinion as to, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except in connection with the rendering of the legal opinions set forth in this Section 5(d) of this Agreement), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that (i) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and the financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements
 
and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) as of its date and the Closing Date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or as amended or supplemented by any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(e) The Underwriters shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Underwriters may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(f) The Underwriters shall have received from Shearman & Sterling LLP, special tax counsel for the Company, an opinion in the form attached hereto as Annex I, dated the Closing Date, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

(h) At the time this Agreement is executed and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP, as independent accountants for the Company and for Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, shall have furnished to the Underwriters a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Underwriters), dated such date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex II.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters such further information, certificates and documents as the Underwriters may reasonably request.

6. .

7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by such Underwriter specifically for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by such Underwriter or by any of the Representatives specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so as to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), approved by the Underwriters in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the
provided
however
 
indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such
pro rata
 
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters for Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
8. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
Default by an Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and
 
the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock or any preferred stock or preferred securities shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in markets in the United States or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner contemplated.
Termination
10. . The respective agreement, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Such additional Securities shall constitute part of the same series of Securities hereunder, unless any such adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) shall cause such additional Securities to constitute, as determined pursuant to an opinion of counsel, a different class of securities than the original series of Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Floating Rate determined by the Calculation Agent, absent manifest error, will be binding and conclusive on the Company and the holders of the Capital Securities and the Trustee.
 
(e) Interest payments during the Floating Rate Period will include accrued interest from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been duly paid or provided for to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, the date of redemption or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. The amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in each quarterly Interest Payment Period. All percentages resulting from any interest rate calculation will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point.
(f) Otherwise than in connection with the maturity or early redemption of the Capital Securities or the payment in whole or in part of deferred or overdue interest on the Capital Securities, interest on the Capital Securities may be paid only on an Interest Payment Date.
(g) To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest not paid when due hereunder, including, without limitation, all Optionally Deferred Interest, will accrue and compound semi-annually (during the Fixed Rate Period) or quarterly (during the Floating Rate Period) at the applicable Coupon Rate on each Interest Payment Date until paid.

Section 3.1 Optional Redemption.
The Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem the Capital Securities for cash, in whole or in part, on or after May 17, 2016, at a cash redemption price equal to the Par Redemption Amount; provided that if the Capital Securities are not redeemed in whole, at least $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Capital Securities (excluding any Capital Securities held by the Company or any of its Affiliates) remains outstanding after giving effect to such redemption.

If the Capital Securities are to be redeemed in part pursuant to Section 3.1, the Capital Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee that the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 3.2 shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of the Capital Securities designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Capital Securities. Each such notice given to a Holder shall state: (i) the date of redemption; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) that the Capital Securities are being redeemed pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Capital Securities together with the facts permitting such redemption; (iv) if less than all outstanding Capital Securities are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Capital Securities to be redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Capital Securities are to be redeemed; and (vi) that interest on the Capital Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the date of redemption.

The redemption price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such redemption or at such earlier time as the Company determines and specifies in the notice of redemption.

Paying Agent an amount of money sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Capital Securities or any portion thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.

If any notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.2, the Capital Securities or portion of the Capital Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price. From and after such date, the Capital Securities to be redeemed shall cease to bear interest. If any Capital Securities called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, on such Capital Securities shall, until paid, bear interest from the date of redemption at the Coupon Rate. On presentation and surrender of such Capital Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price. Upon presentation of any Capital Securities redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, new Capital Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Capital Securities so presented and having the same original issue date, Maturity Date and terms.

During any Optional Deferral (an "Optional Deferral Period"), the Company may pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of any source of funds. Optionally Deferred Interest will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, on each Interest Payment Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate. If Optional Deferral has continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary (as defined in Section 6.3), then the provisions of Section 6.3 hereof will apply, and the Company must (except upon an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities) make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell certain Qualifying Securities. If such efforts are successful, the Company must
 
pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, but the Company cannot pay such Optionally Deferred Interest from sources other than the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities. Additionally, during any Optional Deferral Period, the restrictions on payment by the Company of dividends and other distributions on capital stock pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof will apply. There is no limit on the number of Optional Deferral Periods that the Company may begin.
Section 4.2 Notices of Deferral and Trigger Period.
(a) The Company shall provide a notice of any Optional Deferral no more than sixty and no fewer than fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Subject to Section 4.2(b) hereof, a notice of Optional Deferral, once given, will be irrevocable and the deferral of payments on the related Interest Payment Date will be considered an Optional Deferral, unless a Trigger Event has occurred as of the thirtieth day prior to such Interest Payment Date.
(b) By not later than the fifteenth day prior to each Interest Payment Date during a Trigger Period, the Company will give notice of the continuance of such Trigger Period to the Holders of the Capital Securities. Such notice will, depending on which condition is relied upon in determining that a Trigger Event has occurred, set forth either (x) the Covered Life Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio or (y) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount and the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount, as applicable, and the extent to which these amounts must increase in order for payments of interest from sources other than pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof to resume.
Section 4.3 Trigger Events.
(a) If and to the extent that a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, and regardless of any notice of Optional Deferral that has been previously delivered, the Company may pay interest on the Capital Securities (other than any interest that had accrued during an Optional Deferral Period prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and prior to the occurrence of a Trigger Event, which may remain unpaid or be paid out of any source of funds) only to the extent that such interest is paid in accordance with the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. Any interest that is accrued and unpaid during a period when a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing (a "Trigger Period") will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate. Non-payment of interest may not continue for more than ten consecutive years or extend beyond the Maturity Date of, or the redemption date for, the Capital Securities. If a Trigger Event occurs after commencement of an Optional Deferral, the Optional Deferral will be deemed suspended during the Trigger Period. After the Trigger Period is no longer continuing, the Optional Deferral will resume and any accrued time during the Optional Deferral Period prior to such suspension will be counted toward the five year limitation set forth in Section 4.1.
(b) In the event that a Trigger Period is no longer continuing and at the termination of the Trigger Period there is no unpaid interest from an Optional Deferral Period that had continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may pay subsequent
 
interest in cash from any source of funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, that accrued during the continuance of a Trigger Period may only be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism, except upon an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities; provided, however, that any accrued and unpaid interest will in all events be due and payable upon maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities, except for Foregone Interest (if any).
(c) During such Trigger Period, the restrictions on interest payments from sources other than the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event," such restrictions will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date and the Company's Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount has increased or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount at the end of the Benchmark Quarter for each Interest Payment Date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" and Section 4.3(a) hereof.
Section 5.1 Events of Default.
(a) Section 5.1 of the Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented with respect to the Capital Securities by deleting clauses (1) and (3) thereof and adding the following additional Events of Default:
(i) default for thirty calendar days in the payment of any interest on the Capital Securities when it becomes due and payable (whether or not such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions); however, a default under this provision will not arise if the Company has properly deferred the interest in connection with an Optional Deferral Period or when the provisions of Section 6.3 hereof apply, or the Company has not paid the interest on an Interest Payment Date that occurs during a Trigger Period.
(ii) any non-payment of interest, whether due to an Optional Deferral, during a Trigger Period or otherwise, that continues for ten consecutive years or extends beyond the Maturity Date of, or the redemption date for, the Capital Securities, without all accrued and unpaid interest (including Compounded Interest) having been paid in full.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities do not include failure to comply with or breach of the Company's other covenants set forth in Article VI hereof with respect to the Capital Securities (an "Other Covenant Default"), including the covenant to sell Qualifying Securities through the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism to meet certain interest payment obligations.
 
(c) Holders of the Capital Securities may not themselves institute a proceeding against the Company on account of an Other Covenant Default unless the Trustee fails to institute such a proceeding. However, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Capital Securities may direct the Trustee to bring such a proceeding if an Other Covenant Default continues for a period of ninety days after delivery of written notice to the Company from the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Capital Securities ("Other Covenant Default Notice"), subject to the terms hereof. Except with respect to the covenants contained in Article X of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall not be required to take any action in case of an Other Covenant Default (other than to give notice of such default to the Holders of the Capital Securities) unless so directed by the Holders. In the case of an Other Covenant Default resulting from the Company's breach of its covenants contained in Article X of the Base Indenture, such Other Covenant Default, after its continuance for ninety days after delivery of the Other Covenant Default Notice, will be treated as an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities, and the Trustee will have all of the rights, duties and obligations, and the Holders of the Capital Securities will have all of the rights, in respect of such Other Covenant Default as if such Other Covenant Default were such an Event of Default, except that there will be no right to accelerate the payment of the Capital Securities.
(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1(c) hereof, as to Other Covenant Defaults, the provisions of Section 5.7 of the Base Indenture shall apply with respect to limitations on suits, proceedings and remedies.
(e) Within ninety days after an Event of Default, the Trustee must give to the Holders of the Capital Securities notice of all uncured and unwaived defaults by the Company known to it. However, except in the case of default in payment or interest, the Trustee may withhold such notice if it determines that such withholding is in the interest of such Holders.
Article X of the Base Indenture is hereby supplemented with respect to the Capital Securities by the following additional covenants of the Company:
Section 6.1 Limitation on Payment of Current Interest when Optionally Deferred Interest is Outstanding.
The Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Capital Security during the Interest Payment Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all Optionally Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on such Capital Security. The foregoing covenant shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Holders of the Capital Securities to recover amounts in case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceeding affecting the Company and its property.
 
Section 6.2 Certain Restrictions During Optional Deferral Periods or Following a Trigger Event.
On any date on which accrued interest through the most recent Interest Payment Date has not been paid in full, whether because of an Optional Deferral, the consequences of a Trigger Event or otherwise, the Company will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to:
(a) declare or pay any dividends on, make distributions regarding, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Company, other than:
(i) purchases of the capital stock of the Company in connection with employee or agent benefit plans or the satisfaction of its obligations under any contract or security then outstanding requiring the Company to purchase capital stock or under any dividend reinvestment plan;
(ii) in connection with the reclassifications of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for or into another class or series of the Company's capital stock;
(iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock in connection with the conversion or exchange provisions of that capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged;
(iv) dividends or distributions of the Company's capital stock, or rights to acquire common stock, or repurchases or redemptions of common stock solely from the issuance or exchange of common stock;
(v) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or issuances of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or redemptions or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan; or
(vi) acquisitions of the Company's common stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses made by the Company (which acquisitions are made by the Company's in connection with the satisfaction of indemnification obligations of the sellers of such businesses);
(b) make any payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities issued by the Company that rank equally with or junior to the Capital Securities, other than any payment, repurchase or redemption in respect of debt securities that rank equally with the Capital Securities ("Parity Debt Securities") made ratably and in proportion to the respective amount of (i) accrued and unpaid amounts on such Parity Debt Securities, on the one hand, and (ii) accrued and unpaid amounts on the Capital Securities, on the other hand; and
 
(c) make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any subsidiary, if such guarantee ranks equally with or junior to the Capital Securities, other than any payment in respect of guarantees that rank equally with the Capital Securities ("Parity Guarantees") made ratably and in proportion to the respective amount of (i) accrued and unpaid amounts on such Parity Guarantees, on the one hand, and (ii) accrued and unpaid amounts on the Capital Securities, on the other hand.
Section 6.3 Obligation to Effect Certain Sales of Qualifying Securities; Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism.
(a) Commencing with the first to occur of:
(i) if any Optionally Deferred Interest is outstanding due to an Optional Deferral, the date that is five years after the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company deferred payment of interest on the Capital Securities (excluding any time an Option Deferral is suspended pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof), and for which Optionally Deferred Interest remains outstanding (the "Fifth Deferral Anniversary"), or
(ii) if a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date (regardless of whether a notice of an Optional Deferral has been delivered) (the "Trigger Determination Date"),
the Company shall make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect sales of Qualifying Securities in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay interest in full on the Capital Securities (the "Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism"), which obligation will continue until all unpaid interest has been paid in full; provided that the Company's obligation to make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell its Qualifying Securities to satisfy its obligation to pay interest is subject to Market Disruption Events, does not apply to interest that has accrued during an Optional Deferral Period prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, and does not apply if an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities has occurred and is continuing.
The net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of Qualifying Securities (i) during the 180 days prior to any Interest Payment Date on which the Company is required to use the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism and (ii) designated by the Company at or before the time of such issuance as available to pay interest on the Capital Securities will, at the time such proceeds are delivered to the Trustee to satisfy the relevant interest payment, be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligations to pay interest on the Capital Securities pursuant to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism.
As used in this Section 6.3, the term "Commercially Reasonable Efforts" means commercially reasonable efforts on the part of the Company to complete the offer and sale of shares of its Qualifying Securities to third parties that are not subsidiaries of the Company in public offerings or private placements, provided that the Company will be deemed to have made such commercially reasonable efforts during a Market Disruption Event regardless of whether the Company makes any offers or sales during such Market Disruption Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be considered to have made such Commercially Reasonable
 
Efforts to effect a sale of stock if it determines to not pursue or complete such sale solely due to pricing considerations.
(b) Following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary or the Trigger Determination Date, the Company shall apply the net proceeds received by it from sales of shares of its Qualifying Securities to the payment of interest, with net proceeds to be paid promptly after receipt until all interest amounts owing have been paid in full.
(c) In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of shares of its Qualifying Securities following such Fifth Deferral Anniversary or the Trigger Determination Date are not sufficient to satisfy the full interest amount, such net proceeds will be paid to the Holders of the Capital Securities on a pro rata basis.
(d) Any interest payment made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.3 will first be allocated to payment of the interest due on the next Interest Payment Date. Any payment of interest in excess of the amount of the interest due on that Interest Payment Date will be applied first against any then existing accrued and unpaid interest, in chronological order beginning with the earliest unpaid Interest Payment Date, and then against any accrued and unpaid Compounded Interest. If the Company has outstanding at such time any debt securities ranking with the Capital Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest on such securities and the Company at such time is required to apply such proceeds to pay deferred interest on such securities, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of such deferred interest shall be applied to the Capital Securities and such securities on a pro rata basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a partial payment will be applied (i) to Optionally Deferred Interest but only to the extent that the source of such partial payment is other than the sale of Qualifying Securities, and (ii) first to interest that is unpaid during a Trigger Period and second to Optionally Deferred Interest, to the extent that the source of such partial payment is the sale of Qualifying Securities.

Section 6.4 Payment of Expenses.
In connection with the offering, sale and issuance of the Capital Securities, the Company, in its capacity as borrower with respect to the Capital Securities, shall pay all costs and expenses relating to the offering, sale and issuance of the Capital Securities, including commissions to the underwriters payable pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and compensation of the Trustee under the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7 of the Base Indenture.
Section 6.5 Payment Upon Resignation or Removal.
Upon termination of this Third Supplemental Subordinated Indenture or the Base Indenture or the removal or resignation of the Trustee, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all amounts accrued to the date of such termination, removal or resignation.
 
Article XIII of the Base Indenture shall be superseded by this Article VII with respect to the Capital Securities.
Section 7.1 Agreement to Subordinate.
The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting any Capital Securities agrees, that, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof with respect to any series of Capital Securities, the indebtedness evidenced by the Capital Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article VII, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and that the subordination is for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness, without any act or notice of acceptance hereof or reliance hereon. The Capital Securities shall rank equal in rank and payment with the 6.75% Capital Securities due 2066 of the Company issued under the Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture.
Section 7.2 Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy.
In the event of:
(a) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding relating to the Company, its creditors or its property;
(b) any proceeding for the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings;
(c) any assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors; or
(d) any other marshalling of the assets of the Company,
all Senior Indebtedness (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the commencement of any such proceeding, assignment or marshalling of assets) shall first be paid in full before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made by the Company on account of the Capital Securities. In any such event, any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, which would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Article VII) be payable or deliverable in respect of the Capital Securities (including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) shall be paid or delivered directly to the Holders of Senior Indebtedness, or to their representatives, in accordance with the priorities then existing among such Holders until all Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full. Payments on the Capital Securities in the form of other securities of the Company or those of any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or a readjustment, the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in the subordination provisions of this Indenture with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by the
 
Capital Securities, to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness at the time outstanding and to any securities issued in respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or readjustment, shall be paid or delivered directly to the Holders of Senior Indebtedness and then, if any amounts remain, to the Holders of Capital Securities.
Section 7.3 Default on Senior Indebtedness.
If (i) the Company defaults in the payment of any principal (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or declaration or otherwise or (ii) an event of default occurs with respect to any Senior Indebtedness permitting any Holder thereof to accelerate the maturity thereof and written notice of such event of default (requesting that payments on the Capital Securities cease) is given to the Company by the Holders of Senior Indebtedness, then unless and until such default in payment or event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property or securities, by set-off or otherwise) may be made or agreed to be made on account of the Capital Securities or interest thereon or in respect of any repayment, redemption, retirement, purchase or other acquisition of the Capital Securities.
Section 7.4 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof with respect to any series of Capital Securities, if a distribution is made to the Trustee or any Holder at a time when a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or such Holder has actual knowledge that because of this Article VII such distribution should not have been made to it, the Trustee or such Holder who receives the distribution shall hold it in trust for the benefit of, and, upon written request, shall pay it over to, the Holders of Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, or their agents or representatives, for application to the payment of all principal, premium, if any, and interest then payable with respect to any Senior Indebtedness.
Section 7.5 Subrogation.
Senior Indebtedness shall not be deemed to have been paid in full unless the Holders thereof shall have received cash, securities or other property equal to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness then outstanding. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the Capital Securities are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other indebtedness as to which the right to receive payment is with the Capital Securities) to the rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Indebtedness, and such payments or distributions received by any Holder of Securities, by reason of such subrogation, of cash, securities or other property which otherwise would be paid or distributed to the Holders of Senior Indebtedness, shall, as between the Company and its creditors other than the Holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the one hand, and the Holders of Capital Securities, on the other, be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of Senior Indebtedness, and not on account of Capital Securities.

Section 7.6 Relative Rights.
This Article VII defines the relative rights of Holders and Holders of Senior Indebtedness. Unless otherwise specified in Article XI hereof or pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof with respect to any series of Capital Securities, nothing in this Indenture shall:
(a) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Capital Securities in accordance with their terms;
(b) affect the relative rights of Holders other than their rights in relation to Holders of Senior Indebtedness; or
(c) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, an Other Covenant Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of Holders and owners of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders.
If the Company fails because of this Article VII to pay principal of or interest on Capital Securities on the due date, subject to Section 5.1 hereof, the failure is still a Default and such Default if not cured for thirty calendar days shall constitute an Event of Default.
Section 7.7 Rights of the Trustee; Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
With respect to the Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article VII, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the Holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the Holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall not be liable to any Holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Capital Securities, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any Holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article VII or otherwise.
Section 7.8 Subordination May Not Be Impaired.
No present or future Holder of any Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in the right to enforce subordination of the indebtedness constituting the Securities by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company.
Section 7.9 Distribution.
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article VII, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the Holders of the Senior
 
Indebtedness and other Debt of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article VII.
Section 7.10 Authorization to Effect Subordination.
Each Holder of Capital Securities by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article VII (to the extent the same may be modified pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof with respect to any series of Capital Securities), and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Section 8.1 Notice by the Company.
Subject to Section 4.2 hereof, the Company shall give prompt written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Capital Securities pursuant to the provisions of Article VII hereof; provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Capital Securities to the Senior Indebtedness as provided in Article VII hereof. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Base Indenture and this Third Supplemental Subordinated Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Capital Securities pursuant to the provisions of the Base Indenture; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Article VIII at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Capital Securities), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date.
Section 9.1 Form of Capital Security.
The Capital Securities and the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication to be endorsed thereon are to be substantially in the following forms:

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Indiana (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to , or registered assigns, the principal sum of dollars ($) on , 2066 (the "Maturity Date"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that the Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the Maturity Date will be the next succeeding day which is a Business Day. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from May 17, 2006 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. Until May 17, 2016 or earlier redemption (the "Fixed Rate Period"), each Outstanding Capital Security will bear interest at the per annum rate of % (the "Fixed Rate") payable (subject to the interest deferral provisions of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture) semi-annually in arrears on May 17 and November 17 of each year (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on November 17, 2006, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at such interest rate, compounded semi-annually. Interest payments in respect of Interest Payment Periods during the Fixed Rate Period will include accrued interest from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been duly paid or provided for to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the date of redemption, as the
                                                                                              
                    
            
                    
            
 
case may be, provided, however, that the amount of interest payable for the last Interest Payment Period of the Fixed Rate Period shall be determined from and including the penultimate Interest Payment Date in the Fixed Rate Period to but not including May 17, 2016, regardless of whether or not May 17, 2016 is a Business Day. The amount of interest payable for any full Interest Payment Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve thirty-day months, and the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full Interest Payment Period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of thirty-day months and, for periods of less than a thirty-day month, the actual number of days elapsed per thirty-day month. From May 17, 2016 (or, if May 17, 2016 is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) up to but not including the Maturity Date or earlier redemption (the "Floating Rate Period"), the Capital Securities will bear interest at the per annum rate of 3-Month LIBOR plus a margin equal to % (the "Floating Rate"), payable quarterly on February 17, May 17, August 17 and November 17. Interest payments in respect of Interest Payment Periods during the Floating Rate Period will include accrued interest from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been duly paid or provided for to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. The amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in each quarterly Interest Payment Period. All percentages resulting from any interest rate calculation will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point. If any Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately succeeding Business Day, and if any Interest Payment Date during the Floating Rate Period is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately succeeding Business Day, except that if during the Floating Rate Period such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, then such Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Base Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered at the close of business on the day next preceding the Interest Payment Date; provided, that in the event the Capital Securities will not continue to remain in book-entry form or are not in the form of a Global Certificate, the record date for each Interest Payment Date shall be the first day of the month in which such Interest Payment Date occurs. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such record date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest after the Company has deposited with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of this series of Capital Securities not less than ten days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Capital Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest (including Compounded Interest) on this Capital Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in the United States, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register.
            
 
The indebtedness evidenced by this Capital Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Capital Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Capital Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each Holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Capital Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Capital Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
Dated: May , 2006
    
 
 
This is one of the Debentures referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Debenture is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Capital Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1996 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of , 2006 (the "Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Capital Securities, and of the terms upon which the Capital Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Capital Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $.
        
            
All terms used in this Capital Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XI of the Base Indenture, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem the Capital Securities for cash, in whole or in part, on or after May 17, 2016 at a cash redemption price equal to the Par Redemption Amount; provided that if the Capital Securities are not redeemed in whole, at least $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Capital Securities (excluding any Capital Securities held by the Company or any of its Affiliates) remains outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. Prior to May 17, 2016, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem the Capital Securities in whole but not in part, including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, at a cash redemption price of the greater of (i) the Par Redemption Amount and (ii) the Make-Whole Redemption Amount. With respect to any redemption of Capital Securities as a result of a Tax Event, the date fixed for such redemption will be within 180 days following the occurrence of such Tax Event; provided, however, that if at that time the Company is able to eliminate, within the 180-day period, the Tax Event by taking some ministerial action (such as making an election or filing a form) that has no adverse effect on the Company or the Holders of the Capital Securities, the Company will pursue such action in lieu of redemption. The Company will have no right or obligation to redeem the Capital Securities while pursuing such measure.
Any redemption will be made upon not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days notice before the date fixed for redemption to the registered Holder of the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities are to be redeemed in part, the Capital Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee that the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. Any notice mailed as provided herein shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of the Capital Securities designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Capital Securities. Each such notice given to a Holder shall state: (i) the date of redemption; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) that the Capital Securities are being redeemed pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Capital Securities together with the facts
 
permitting such redemption; (iv) if less than all outstanding Capital Securities are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular capital securities to be redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Capital Securities are to be redeemed; and (vi) that interest on the Capital Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Capital Securities are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the Holders of Capital Securities at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. The redemption price shall be paid prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such redemption or at such earlier time as the Company determines and specifies in the notice of redemption. The Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent an amount of money sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Capital Securities or any portion thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.
If any notice of redemption has been given as provided herein, the Capital Securities or portion of the Capital Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price. From and after such date, the Capital Securities to be redeemed shall cease to bear interest. If any Capital Securities called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, on such Capital Securities shall, until paid, bear interest from the date of redemption at the Coupon Rate. On presentation and surrender of such Capital Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price. Upon presentation of any Capital Securities redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, new Capital Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Capital Securities so presented and having the same original issue date, Maturity Date and terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Capital Securities will also be a new Global Security.
The Capital Securities are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default with respect to Capital Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Capital Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Capital Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all
 
Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Capital Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Capital Security and of any Capital Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Capital Security.
So long as no Event of Default or Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company may elect at any time during the term of the Capital Securities, and from time to time, to defer one or more payments of interest on such Capital Securities (an "Optional Deferral" and any such deferred interest, "Optionally Deferred Interest") for up to five years (excluding any time an Optional Deferral is suspended pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture). During any period of Optional Deferral (an "Optional Deferral Period"), the Company may pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of any source of funds. Optionally Deferred Interest will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, on each Interest Payment Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate. If Optional Deferral has continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary (as defined in Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture), then the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture will apply, and the Company must (except upon an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities) make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell certain Qualifying Securities. If such efforts are successful, the Company must pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, but the Company cannot pay such Optionally Deferred Interest from sources other than the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities. Additionally, during any Optional Deferral Period, the restrictions on payment by the Company of dividends and other distributions on capital stock pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture will apply. There is no limit on the number of Optional Deferral Periods that the Company may begin.
The Company shall provide a notice of any Optional Deferral no more than sixty and no fewer than fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Subject to Section 4.2(b) of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, a notice of Optional Deferral, once given, will be irrevocable and the deferral of payments on the related Interest Payment Date will be considered an Optional Deferral, unless a Trigger Event has occurred as of the thirtieth day prior to such Interest Payment Date.
By not later than the fifteenth day prior to each Interest Payment Date during a Trigger Period, the Company will give notice of the continuance of such Trigger Period to the Holders of the Capital Securities. Such notice will, depending on which condition is relied upon in determining that a Trigger Event has occurred, set forth either (x) the Covered Life Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio or (y) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount and the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount, as applicable, and the extent to which these amounts must increase in order for payments of interest from sources other than pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture to resume.
 
If and to the extent that a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, and regardless of any notice of Optional Deferral that has been previously delivered, the Company may pay interest on the Capital Securities (other than any interest that had accrued during an Optional Deferral Period prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and prior to the occurrence of a Trigger Event, which may remain unpaid or be paid out of any source of funds) only to the extent that such interest is paid in accordance with Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture. Any interest that is accrued and unpaid during a period when a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing (a "Trigger Period") will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate.
In the event that a Trigger Period is no longer continuing and at the termination of the Trigger Period there is no unpaid interest from an Optional Deferral Period that had continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may pay subsequent interest in cash from any source of funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, that accrued during the continuance of a Trigger Period may only be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, except upon an Event of Default; provided, however, that any accrued and unpaid interest will in all events be due and payable upon maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities, except for Foregone Interest if certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, whether voluntary or not, occur with respect to the Company prior to the maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities.
During such Trigger Period, the restrictions on interest payments from sources other than the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event," such restrictions will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date and the Company's Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount has increased or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount at the end of the Benchmark Quarter for each Interest Payment Date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" and Section 4.3(a) of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture.
The Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Capital Security during the Interest Payment Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all Optionally Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on such Capital Security. The foregoing covenant shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Holders of the Capital Securities to recover amounts in case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceeding affecting the Company and its property.
Each Holder of a Capital Security, by such Holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for, and thus no
 
right to receive, interest that is unpaid due to certain consequences of a Trigger Event (including Compounded Interest) and has not been settled through the application of the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism, to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Capital Security in respect of which such interest was deferred.
Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph and Article XI of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Capital Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Capital Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Capital Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Capital Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Base Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Capital Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Capital Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Capital Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Capital Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. This Global Security is exchangeable for Capital Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture. Capital Securities so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Base Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Capital Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Capital Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Capital Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
 
penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Company agrees and, by its acceptance of this Capital Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Capital Security agrees to treat this Capital Security as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local tax purposes.
THE INDENTURE AND THIS CAPITAL SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.
Section 10.1 Original Issue of Capital Securities.
Capital Securities in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $800,000,000, except as provided in Section 2.1(b) hereof, may, upon execution of this Third Supplemental Subordinated Indenture, be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Capital Securities to or upon the written order of the Company, signed by its Chief Executive Officer, its President, or any Vice President and its Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, without any further action by the Company.
The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of the year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
Section 11.1 Limitation on Claim for Deferred Interest Due to a Trigger Event in Bankruptcy.
Each Holder of a Capital Security, by such Holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for, and thus no right to receive, interest that is unpaid due to certain consequences of a Trigger Event (including Compounded Interest) and has not been settled through the application of the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism, to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Capital Security in respect of which such interest was deferred. Amounts to which the Holders of the Capital
 
Securities would have been entitled to receive hereunder, but for operation of this Section 11.1 are referred to as "Foregone Interest."
Section 12.1 Termination of Company's Obligations Under Certain Covenants.
Subject to Article XIII of the Base Indenture, the Company, at its option, either (a) shall be deemed to have been Discharged (as defined below) from its obligations with respect to the Capital Securities on the ninety-first day after the applicable conditions set forth below have been satisfied or (b) shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 10.4 of the Base Indenture and Article VI hereof with respect to the Capital Securities at any time after the applicable conditions set forth below have been satisfied:
(1) the Company shall have deposited or caused to be deposited irrevocably with the Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically assigned as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of the Capital Securities (A) money in an amount, or (B) Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the first day preceding such day which is not a Business Day) before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination of (A) and (B), sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent registered public accounting firm selected by the Company expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the principal of and interest, if any, on the outstanding Capital Securities on the dates such principal and interest, if any, are due;
(2) if the Capital Securities are then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option under this paragraph would not cause such Capital Securities to be delisted;
(3) no Event of Default, or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Capital Securities under Section 5.1 of the Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by Section 5.1 hereof shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and the Company shall have furnished to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to such effect; and
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee the following: (a) either (i) an Opinion of Counsel or (ii) a ruling from, or published by, the Internal Revenue Service, whichever of (i) or (ii) the Company shall determine, to the effect that Holders of the Capital Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 12.01 and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised and (b) either (i) an Opinion of Counsel or (ii) a no-action letter from, or issued by, the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever of
 
(i) or (ii) the Company shall determine, to the effect that the deposit with the Trustee of money and/or Government Securities as trust funds as provided in this Section 12.01 will not be considered an investment company required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Company shall give notice to the Holders of the Capital Securities at the time Government Obligations are deposited with the Trustee.
"Discharged" means, for purposes of this Section 12.01, that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Capital Securities and to have satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture relating to the Capital Securities (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute such instruments as may be requested by the Company acknowledging the same), except (A) the rights of Holders of Capital Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described above, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Capital Securities when such payments are due; (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 1.9, 3.5, 3.6, 4.2, 6.7, 6.10, 7.1, 10.2 and 10.3 of the Base Indenture; and (C) the rights, powers, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any Capital Securities, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Sections 1.9 and 6.7 of the Base Indenture shall survive.
Section 12.2 Application of Trust Money.
All moneys and Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 12.01 and, with respect to Government Obligations, the principal and interest in respect thereof, shall be held irrevocably in trust and applied by it to the payment in accordance with the provisions of the Capital Securities and this Indenture, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company if acting as its own Paying Agent), to the Holders of the Capital Securities for the payment or redemption of which such money has been deposited with the Trustee, of all sums due and to become due thereon for principal and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Section 12.3 Repayment to Company.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or interest on any Capital Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Capital Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.
Section 12.4 Indemnity for Government Obligations.
The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such Government Obligations.
 
Section 12.5 Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into an indenture supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for the purpose of the transfer of property pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof.
Section 13.1 Acts of Holders.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of the Capital Securities may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent or proxy duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may take any Act, such Act may be evidenced by: (a) instruments executed by Holders; (b) the record of Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of such Holders; or (c) a combination of such instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders.
Section 13.2 Proof of Ownership; Proof of Execution of Instruments by Holder.
The ownership of Registered Securities of any series shall be proved by the Securities Register for such series or by a certificate of the Securities Registrar for such series.
Subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the Base Indenture and Section 14.5 hereof, proof of the execution of a writing appointing an agent or proxy and of the execution of any instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company if made in the following manner:
The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds, that the Person executing such instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, as the case may be, or by any other Person acting in a representative capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
The record of any Holders' meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 14.6 hereof.
 
The Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section so long as the request is a reasonable one.
Section 13.3 Persons Deemed Owners.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7 of the Base Indenture) interest, if any, on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All payments made to any Holder, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon such Security.
Section 13.4 Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound.
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 13.1 hereof, of the taking of any Act by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities specified in this Indenture in connection with such Act, any Holder of a Security the number, letter or other distinguishing symbol of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such Act may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of ownership as provided in Section 13.2 hereof, revoke such Act so far as it concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid, any such Act taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.8 of the Base Indenture, upon all future Holders of such Security and of any Securities issued on transfer or in lieu thereof or in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security or such other Securities.

The Trustee for any series may at any time call a meeting of Holders of such series to take any action specified in Section 14.1 hereof, to be held at such time or times and at such place or places as the Trustee for such series shall determine. Notice of every meeting of the Holders of any series, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be given to Holders of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.6 of the Base Indenture. Such notice shall be given not less than ten days nor more than ninety days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders a Person shall be (a) a Holder of a Security of the series with respect to which such meeting is being held or (b) a Person appointed by an instrument in writing as agent or proxy by such Holder.

Section 14.5 Regulations.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee for any series may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of such series, in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate.
The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of such
 
series as provided in Section 14.3 hereof, in which case the Company or the Holders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by a majority vote of the meeting.
Subject to the provisos in the definition of "Outstanding," at any meeting each Holder of a Security of the series with respect to which such meeting is being held or proxy therefor shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount, as applicable (or such other amount as shall be specified pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Base Indenture) of Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of Outstanding Debt.
Securities of such series held by him or instruments in writing duly designating him as the Person to vote on behalf of Holders of Securities of such series. Any meeting of Holders with respect to which a meeting was duly called pursuant to the provisions of Section 14.2 or 14.3 hereof may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of such Holders present representing a majority of votes eligible to be cast at such meeting of the series with respect to which such meeting is being held and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

Exhibit 4.2
THIS DEBENTURE IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE CLEARING AGENCY OR A NOMINEE OF THE CLEARING AGENCY. THIS DEBENTURE IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR DEBENTURES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE CLEARING AGENCY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS DEBENTURE (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER OF THIS DEBENTURE AS A WHOLE BY THE CLEARING AGENCY TO A NOMINEE OF THE CLEARING AGENCY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE CLEARING AGENCY TO THE CLEARING AGENCY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE CLEARING AGENCY) MAY BE REGISTERED EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
UNLESS THIS DEBENTURE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK) TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT AND ANY DEBENTURE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Indiana (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($800,000,000) on May 17, 2066 (the "Maturity Date"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that the Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the Maturity Date will be the next succeeding day which is a Business Day. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum
from May 17, 2006 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. Until May 17, 2016 or earlier redemption (the "Fixed Rate Period"), each Outstanding Capital Security will bear interest at the per annum rate of 7% (the "Fixed Rate") payable (subject to the interest deferral provisions of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture) semi-annually in arrears on May 17 and November 17 of each year (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on November 17, 2006, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at such interest rate, compounded semi-annually. Interest payments in respect of Interest Payment Periods during the Fixed Rate Period will include accrued interest from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been duly paid or provided for to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the date of redemption, as the case may be, provided, however, that the amount of interest payable for the last Interest Payment Period of the Fixed Rate Period shall be determined from and including the penultimate Interest Payment Date in the Fixed Rate Period to but not including May 17, 2016, regardless of whether or not May 17, 2016 is a Business Day. The amount of interest payable for any full Interest Payment Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve thirty-day months, and the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full Interest Payment Period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of thirty-day months and, for periods of less than a thirty-day month, the actual number of days elapsed per thirty-day month. From May 17, 2016 (or, if May 17, 2016 is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) up to but not including the Maturity Date or earlier redemption (the "Floating Rate Period"), the Capital Securities will bear interest at the per annum rate of 3-Month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.3575% (the "Floating Rate"), payable quarterly on February 17, May 17, August 17 and November 17. Interest payments in respect of Interest Payment Periods during the Floating Rate Period will include accrued interest from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been duly paid or provided for to, but not including, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. The amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in each quarterly Interest Payment Period. All percentages resulting from any interest rate calculation will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point. If any Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately succeeding Business Day, and if any Interest Payment Date during the Floating Rate Period is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately succeeding Business Day, except that if during the Floating Rate Period such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, then such Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Base Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered at the close of business on the day next preceding the Interest Payment Date; provided, that in the event the Capital Securities will not continue to remain in book-entry form or are not in the form of a Global Certificate, the record date for each Interest
 
Payment Date shall be the first day of the month in which such Interest Payment Date occurs. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such record date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest after the Company has deposited with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of this series of Capital Securities not less than ten days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Capital Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest (including Compounded Interest) on this Capital Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in the United States, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register.
The indebtedness evidenced by this Capital Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Capital Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Capital Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each Holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Capital Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Capital Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lincoln National Corporation has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
Dated: May 17, 2006
Dated: May 17, 2006
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Debenture is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Capital Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1996 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 17, 2006 (the "Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Capital Securities, and of the terms upon which the Capital Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Capital Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $800,000,000.
All terms used in this Capital Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XI of the Base Indenture, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem the Capital Securities for cash, in whole or in part, on or after May 17, 2016 at a cash redemption price equal to the Par Redemption Amount; provided that if the Capital Securities are not redeemed in whole, at least $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Capital Securities (excluding any Capital Securities held by the Company or any of its Affiliates) remains outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. Prior to May 17, 2016, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem the Capital Securities in whole but not in part, including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, at a cash redemption price of the greater of (i) the Par Redemption Amount and (ii) the Make-Whole Redemption Amount. With respect to any redemption of Capital Securities as a result of a Tax Event, the date fixed for such redemption will be within 180 days following the occurrence of such Tax Event; provided, however, that if at that time the Company is able to eliminate, within the 180-day period, the Tax Event by taking some ministerial action (such as making an election or filing a form) that has no adverse effect on the Company or the Holders of the Capital Securities, the Company will pursue such action in lieu of redemption. The Company will have no right or obligation to redeem the Capital Securities while pursuing such measure.
Any redemption will be made upon not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days notice before the date fixed for redemption to the registered Holder of the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities are to be redeemed in part, the Capital
 
Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee that the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. Any notice mailed as provided herein shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of the Capital Securities designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Capital Securities. Each such notice given to a Holder shall state: (i) the date of redemption; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) that the Capital Securities are being redeemed pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Capital Securities together with the facts permitting such redemption; (iv) if less than all outstanding Capital Securities are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular capital securities to be redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Capital Securities are to be redeemed; and (vi) that interest on the Capital Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Capital Securities are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the Holders of Capital Securities at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. The redemption price shall be paid prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such redemption or at such earlier time as the Company determines and specifies in the notice of redemption. The Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent an amount of money sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Capital Securities or any portion thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.
If any notice of redemption has been given as provided herein, the Capital Securities or portion of the Capital Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price. From and after such date, the Capital Securities to be redeemed shall cease to bear interest. If any Capital Securities called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, on such Capital Securities shall, until paid, bear interest from the date of redemption at the Coupon Rate. On presentation and surrender of such Capital Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price. Upon presentation of any Capital Securities redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, new Capital Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Capital Securities so presented and having the same original issue date, Maturity Date and terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Capital Securities will also be a new Global Security.
The Capital Securities are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default with respect to Capital Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Capital Securities of this series may be
 
declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Capital Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Capital Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Capital Security and of any Capital Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Capital Security.
So long as no Event of Default or Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company may elect at any time during the term of the Capital Securities, and from time to time, to defer one or more payments of interest on such Capital Securities (an "Optional Deferral" and any such deferred interest, "Optionally Deferred Interest") for up to five years (excluding any time an Optional Deferral is suspended pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture). During any period of Optional Deferral (an "Optional Deferral Period"), the Company may pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of any source of funds. Optionally Deferred Interest will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, on each Interest Payment Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate. If Optional Deferral has continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary (as defined in Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture), then the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture will apply, and the Company must (except upon an Event of Default with respect to the Capital Securities) make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell certain Qualifying Securities. If such efforts are successful, the Company must pay Optionally Deferred Interest out of the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, but the Company cannot pay such Optionally Deferred Interest from sources other than the net proceeds from the sale of such Qualifying Securities. Additionally, during any Optional Deferral Period, the restrictions on payment by the Company of dividends and other distributions on capital stock pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture will
 
apply. There is no limit on the number of Optional Deferral Periods that the Company may begin.
The Company shall provide a notice of any Optional Deferral no more than sixty and no fewer than fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Subject to Section 4.2(b) of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, a notice of Optional Deferral, once given, will be irrevocable and the deferral of payments on the related Interest Payment Date will be considered an Optional Deferral, unless a Trigger Event has occurred as of the thirtieth day prior to such Interest Payment Date.
By not later than the fifteenth day prior to each Interest Payment Date during a Trigger Period, the Company will give notice of the continuance of such Trigger Period to the Holders of the Capital Securities. Such notice will, depending on which condition is relied upon in determining that a Trigger Event has occurred, set forth either (x) the Covered Life Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio or (y) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount and the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount, as applicable, and the extent to which these amounts must increase in order for payments of interest from sources other than pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture to resume.
If and to the extent that a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, and regardless of any notice of Optional Deferral that has been previously delivered, the Company may pay interest on the Capital Securities (other than any interest that had accrued during an Optional Deferral Period prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and prior to the occurrence of a Trigger Event, which may remain unpaid or be paid out of any source of funds) only to the extent that such interest is paid in accordance with Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture. Any interest that is accrued and unpaid during a period when a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing (a "Trigger Period") will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable Coupon Rate.
In the event that a Trigger Period is no longer continuing and at the termination of the Trigger Period there is no unpaid interest from an Optional Deferral Period that had continued beyond the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may pay subsequent interest in cash from any source of funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, that accrued during the continuance of a Trigger Period may only be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, except upon an Event of Default; provided, however, that any accrued and unpaid interest will in all events be due and payable upon maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities, except for Foregone Interest if certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, whether voluntary or not, occur with respect to the Company prior to the maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities.
 
During such Trigger Period, the restrictions on interest payments from sources other than the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event," such restrictions will continue until neither of the conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" exists as of the thirtieth day prior to an Interest Payment Date and the Company's Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount has increased or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount at the end of the Benchmark Quarter for each Interest Payment Date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed under clause (ii) of the definition of "Trigger Event" and Section 4.3(a) of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture.
The Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Capital Security during the Interest Payment Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all Optionally Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on such Capital Security. The foregoing covenant shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Holders of the Capital Securities to recover amounts in case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceeding affecting the Company and its property.
Each Holder of a Capital Security, by such Holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for, and thus no right to receive, interest that is unpaid due to certain consequences of a Trigger Event (including Compounded Interest) and has not been settled through the application of the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism, to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Capital Security in respect of which such interest was deferred.
Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph and Article XI of the Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture, no reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Capital Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Capital Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Capital Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Capital Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Base Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly
 
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Capital Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Capital Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Capital Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Capital Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Capital Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. This Global Security is exchangeable for Capital Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture. Capital Securities so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Base Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Capital Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Capital Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Capital Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Company agrees and, by its acceptance of this Capital Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Capital Security agrees to treat this Capital Security as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local tax purposes.
THE INDENTURE AND THIS CAPITAL SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

We have acted as special U.S. federal income tax counsel to Lincoln National Corporation, an Indiana corporation ("Lincoln"), in connection with the registration and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), by Lincoln, of the prospectus supplement dated May 12, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the public offering by Lincoln of an aggregate principal amount of $800,000,000 of 7% Capital Securities due 2066 (the "Capital Securities"). The Prospectus Supplement accompanies the prospectus included in the Registration Statement (as defined below) (the "Prospectus"). The Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus were filed with the Commission on May 15, 2006, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act. The Capital Securities are being issued pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1996 (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of May 17, 2006 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), in each case, between Lincoln and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest of Bank One Trust Company, National Association and the First National Bank of Chicago), as indenture trustee.
In furnishing this opinion letter, we have reviewed (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-132416), (the "Registration Statement") covering, among other securities, the Capital Securities, which Registration Statement became effective under the Act on March 14, 2006; (ii) the Prospectus; (iii) the Prospectus Supplement; (iv) the Indenture; (v) the Supplemental Indenture; (vi) the form of the Capital Securities contained in the Supplemental Indenture; and (vii) such other records, documents, certificates or other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below (collectively, the "Transaction Documents"). In this regard, we have assumed without independent investigation or inquiry the legal capacity of all natural persons executing the Transaction Documents, the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified copies, the authenticity of all original or certified copies, the conformity to original or certified Transaction Documents of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies and that the
Capital Securities will be in a form substantially identical to the form of the Capital Securities contained in the Supplemental Indenture. Further, we have assumed that all disclosures, representations and warranties in the Transaction Documents were true, correct and complete when made, and continue to be true correct and complete as of the date hereof, and that there has been, and will continue to be, full compliance with all agreements and covenants contained in the Transaction Documents. Additionally, we have relied as to factual matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, representations and statements of employees and representatives of Lincoln and other persons whom we have deemed appropriate, including certain statements made by representatives of Lincoln to us.
Based upon the foregoing, in reliance thereon and subject thereto, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, and based further upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations (including proposed Treasury regulations) promulgated thereunder, administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof (and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis), the statements of law and legal conclusions in the discussion under the heading "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus Supplement represent our opinion, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth therein.
No opinion is expressed as to any matter not specifically addressed above, including the tax consequences of the issuance of the Capital Securities under state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, and the reasonableness of our assumptions relied upon by us in rendering our opinion above. Moreover, this opinion is based upon current U.S. federal income tax law and administrative practice, and we do not undertake to advise you as to any changes in such law or practice unless we are specifically retained to do so. Furthermore, the conclusion set forth in this opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS or the courts, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not take contrary positions upon an examination, or that a court will agree with such conclusions if litigated.
We consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, to be filed with the Commission in connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the use of our name under the headings "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
