Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors increased the target performance share awards for four executive officers, including two executive officers named in the summary compensation table of our 2006 proxy statement, Robert W. Dineen, President, Lincoln Financial Advisors and Westley V. Thompson, President, Employer Markets. The increase relates to the 2006-2008 performance cycle, and the final number of shares to be received, if any, depends upon satisfaction of the performance targets for the cycle. The increases were made to correct an inadvertent error in the original awards resulting in a decrease in the executives total direct compensation as compared to 2005. As a result, the Committee increased Mr. Dineens and Mr. Thompsons target performance share awards by 1,548 shares and 1,511 shares, respectively. More information about the performance awards for the 2006-2008 cycle is included in our Form 8-K filed on April 18, 2006, including the Overview of the
2006 Long Term Incentives For Senior Management Committee Members filed as
Exhibit 10.1 to the Form 8-K.

To be timely, a shareholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the corporation, not less than ninety days nor more than one hundred twenty days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year; provided, however, if and only if the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty days before such anniversary date and ends thirty days after such anniversary date (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an

In no event shall the adjournment of an annual meeting or special meeting, or any announcement thereof, commence a new period for the giving of a shareholders notice as provided in this Section 11. No shareholder nomination shall be effective unless made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11.

Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
 
Section 13.
  
 
Voting Procedures on Change of Control
. In addition to any other authority granted under Indiana law for the corporation to enter into any arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of voting shares, pursuant to the authority granted in Indiana Code Section 23-1-22-4, the corporation shall have the power to enter into any arrangement, agreement or understanding of any nature whatsoever and for any duration whereby the board of directors or any group of directors of the corporation can specify or direct the voting by any other person of any shares of any class or series beneficially owned by such person, or as to which such person has the direct or indirect power to direct the voting, in connection with a change of control of the corporation. As used in this Section 13, the term control shall have the same meaning as set forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-22-4.

In the event that an arrangement, agreement or understanding is in effect, and the voting shares of the corporation are not voted in accordance with any such arrangement, agreement or understanding, neither such voting shares nor such votes shall be counted in connection with any vote of the corporations shareholders relating to any aspect of a change of control.
 
 
Section 1.
  
 
General Powers, Number, Classes and Tenure

Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, the number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment of these bylaws, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. The directors shall be divided into three classes, each class to consist, as nearly as may be, of one-third of the number of directors then constituting the whole board of directors, with one class to be elected annually by shareholders for a term of three years, to hold office until their respective successors are elected and qualified; except that
 
(1)

(2)
  
the term of office of a director who is elected by either the directors or shareholders to fill a vacancy in the board of directors shall expire at the end of the term of office of the succeeded directors class or at the end of the term of office of such other class as determined by the board of directors to be necessary or desirable in order to equalize the number of directors among the classes;
 
(3)
  
the board of directors may adopt a policy limiting the time beyond which certain directors are not to continue to serve, the effect of which may be to produce classes of unequal size or to cause certain directors either to be nominated for election for a term of less than three years or to cease to be a director before expiration of the term of the directors class.
 
  
In case of any increase in the number of directors, the additional directors shall be distributed among the several classes to make the size of the classes as equal as possible.

Section 2.
  
 
Advisory Committees
. The board of directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole board of directors, from time to time designate one or more advisory committees, a majority of whose members shall be directors. An advisory committee shall serve at the pleasure of the board of directors, keep a record of its proceedings and adopt its own rules of procedure. It shall make such reports to the board of directors of its actions as may be required by the board.
 
Section 3.
  
 
Manner of Acting
. Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of a committee established under this Article IV may be taken without a meeting, if a written consent to such action is signed by all members of the committee and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the committee. Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, any or all members of such committee may participate in a meeting of the committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other, and participation in this manner constitutes presence in person at the meeting.

Section 1.
  
 
Certificates for Shares
. Shares may, but need not be, represented by certificates. Each shareholder, upon request, shall be entitled to a certificate, signed by the president or a vice president and the secretary or any assistant secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation. If such certificate is countersigned by the written signature of a transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee, the signatures of the officers of the corporation may be facsimiles. If such certificate is countersigned by the written signature of a registrar other than the corporation or its employee, the signatures of the transfer agent and the officers of the corporation may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of its issue. Certificates representing shares of the corporation shall be in such form consistent with the laws of the State of Indiana as shall be determined by the board of directors. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer records of the corporation.
 
Section 2.
  
 
Transfer of Shares
. Transfer of shares of the corporation shall be made on the stock transfer records of the corporation by the holder of record thereof or by his legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the corporation, and, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, on surrender for cancellation of the certificates for such shares.

Section 3.
  
 
Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates
. Any person claiming a certificate of stock to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, and who requests the issuance of a new certificate before the corporation has notice that the certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall make an affidavit of that fact and shall give the corporation and its transfer agents and registrars a bond of indemnity with unlimited liability, in form and with one or more corporate sureties satisfactory to the chief executive officer or treasurer of the corporation (except that the chief executive officer or treasurer may authorize the acceptance of a bond of different amount, or a bond with personal surety thereon, or a personal agreement of indemnity), whereupon in the discretion of the chief executive officer or the treasurer and except as otherwise provided by law a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken. In lieu of a separate bond of indemnity in each case, the chief executive officer of the corporation may accept an assumption of liability under a blanket bond issued in favor of the corporation and its transfer agents and registrars by one or more corporate sureties satisfactory to him.
 
Section 4.
  
 
Transfer Agent and Registrars
. The board of directors by resolution may appoint a transfer agent or agents or a registrar or registrars of transfer, or both. All such appointments shall confer such powers, rights, duties and obligations consistent with the laws of the State of Indiana as the board of directors shall determine. The board of directors may appoint the treasurer of the corporation and one or more assistant treasurers to serve as transfer agent or agents.
 
Section 5.
  
 
Record Date
. For the purposes of determining shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall fix in advance a date as a record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than seventy days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders.
 
 
  
No person or his personal representatives shall be liable to the corporation for any loss or damage suffered by it on account of any action taken or omitted to be taken by such person in good faith as an officer or employee of the corporation, or as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, which he serves or served at the request of the corporation, if such person (a) exercised and used the same degree of care and skill as a prudent man would have exercised and used under like circumstances, charged with a like duty, or (b) took or omitted to take such action in reliance upon advice of counsel for the corporation or such enterprise or upon statements made or information furnished by persons employed or retained by the corporation or such enterprise upon which he had reasonable grounds to rely. The foregoing shall not be exclusive of other rights and defenses to which such person or his personal representatives may be entitled under law.

Section 1.
  
 
Actions by a Third Party
. The corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a defendant or respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than actions by or in the right of the corporation), and whether formal or informal, who is or was a director, officer, or employee of the corporation or who, while a director, officer, or employee of the corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against:
 
(A)
  
any reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred with respect to a proceeding, if such person is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of such proceeding, or
 
(B)
  
judgments, settlements, penalties, fines (including excise taxes assessed with respect to employee benefit plans) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred with respect to a proceeding where such person is not wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of the proceeding if:
 
(i)
  
the individuals conduct was in good faith; and
 
(ii)
  
the individual reasonably believed:
 
(C)
  
in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a director, officer or employee of the corporation, that the individuals conduct was in the corporations best interests; and
 
(D)
  
in all other cases, that the individuals conduct was at least not opposed to the corporations best interests; and
 
(i)
  
in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual either:
 
(E)
  
had reasonable cause to believe the individuals conduct was lawful; or
 
(F)
  
had no reasonable cause to believe the individuals conduct was unlawful.
 
(G)
  
The termination of a proceeding by a judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director, officer, or employee did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.
 
Section 2.
  
 
Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation
. The corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a defendant or respondent, to a proceeding, including any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, or employee of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against any reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees):
 
 
 
14
 
 
(A)
  
if such person is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of such proceeding, or
 
(B)
  
if not wholly successful:
 
(i)
  
the individuals conduct was in good faith; and
 
(ii)
  
the individual reasonably believed:
 
(C)
  
in the case of conduct in the individuals capacity as a director, officer, or employee of the corporation, that the individuals conduct was in the corporations best interests; and
 
(D)
  
in all other cases, that the individuals conduct was at least not opposed to the corporations best interests, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application, that despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.
 
Section 3.
  
 
Methods of Determining Whether Standards for Indemnification Have Been Met.
Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2. In the case of directors of the corporation such determination shall be made by any one of the following procedures:
 
(A)
  
by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
 
(B)
  
if a quorum cannot be obtained under (a), by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
 
(C)
  
by special legal counsel:
 
(i)
  
selected by the board of directors or a committee thereof in the manner prescribed in (a) or (b); or
 
 
 
15
 
 
(ii)
  
if a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under (a) and a committee cannot be designated under (b), selected by a majority vote of the full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may participate).
 
  
In the case of persons who are not directors of the corporation, such determination shall be made (a) by the chief executive officer of the corporation or (b) if the chief executive officer so directs or in his absence, in the manner such determination would be made if the person were a director of the corporation.
 
Section 4.
  
 
Advancement of Defense Expenses
. The corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, or employee who is a party to a proceeding described in Section 1 or 2 of this Article in advance of the final disposition of said proceeding if:
 
(A)
  
the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct described in Section 1 or 2; and
 
(B)
  
the director, officer, or employee furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the director, officer or employee did not meet the standard of conduct; and
 
(C)
  
a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under Section 1 or 2.
 
(D)
  
The undertaking required by this Section must be an unlimited general obligation of the director, officer, or employee but need not be secured and may be accepted by the corporation without reference to the financial ability of such person to make repayment.
 
Section 5.
  
 
Non-Exclusiveness of Indemnification
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for or authorized by this Article does not exclude any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses that a person may have under:
 
(A)
  
the corporations articles of incorporation or bylaws;
 
(B)
  
any resolution of the board of directors or the shareholders of the corporation;
 
(C)
  
any other authorization adopted by the shareholders; or
 
(D)
  
otherwise as provided by law, both as to such persons actions in his capacity as a director, officer, or employee of the corporation and as to actions in another capacity while holding such office.
 
  
Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, or employee, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of such person.
 
 
 
16
 
 
 
  
Except as set forth in Section 2 of Article II, these bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new bylaws may be made by a majority of the whole board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.
