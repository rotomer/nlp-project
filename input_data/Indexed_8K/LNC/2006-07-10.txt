Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
As a result of the consummation of our merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corporation on April 3, 2006, we have changed our reporting segments for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. The change in our reporting segments is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, and reflects the manner in which we are currently organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, we will begin reporting the new segments beginning with results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
To aid investors in their understanding of our new reporting segments prior to issuing our results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we are providing our previously issued statistical supplement for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, revised to reflect the new reporting segments in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  With the exception of a specific page dedicated to combined sales data, the revised data does not give effect to the merger with Jefferson-Pilot. A copy of the statistical supplement for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 revised for segmentation is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The following is a brief description of our new business units and their related segments:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We are also attaching as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporating herewith a copy of the slides in connection with our investor presentation to be held on July 11, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. (E.D.T), during which members of management will discuss the new reporting segment presentation and related matters, including GAAP purchase accounting.
Interested persons may listen to a webcast of the presentation and obtain a copy of the reissued statistical supplement and the slide presentation by going to our website--www.lfg.com by clicking Shareholders & Analysts and then Webcasts.

The financial datea in this document is dated May 2, 2006 and has not been updated since that date, except for the impacts of re-segmentation and certain reclassifications. LNC does not intend to update this document.

This schedule combines the previously reported data for LNC and JP and does not reflect any adjustments that may have
resulted had the merger been completed prior to the periods presented.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sales for Individual Life Insurance consist of first year commissionable premium for Universal life ("UL"), including Moneyguard, and COLI plus 5% of excess premium received, including UL internal replacements, and first year paid premiums for Whole life and Term products.
(1)
 
 Other consists of distibution arrangements with third-party intermediaries
(2)
 
 
 
 
 
(4) The net investment income and spread for the first quarter of 2006 includes 17 basis points of incremental yield from special investments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) For the annuity products spread, the yield on earning assets is calculated as net investment income on fixed product investment portfolios divided by average earning assets. The average crediting rate is calculated using interest credited on annuity products less bonus credits and excess DCA interest, divided by average fixed account values net of co-insured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified co-insurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation since assets (and therefore margin) are retained under these agreements.
 
(2) The net investment income and spread reported above includes earnings from commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums. The impact of these premiums on investment income and spread was 9 bps in the first quarter of 2006, 6 bps in the fourth quarter of 2005, 1 bp in the third quarter of 2005, 2 bps in the second quarter of 2005 and 6 bps in the first quarter of 2005.
