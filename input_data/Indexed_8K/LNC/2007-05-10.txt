The right of the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, to participate in the election of Directors pursuant to this Section shall continue in effect, in the case of all Preferred Stock entitled to receive cumulative dividends, until all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid or declared and set apart for payment on all cumulative Preferred Stock, the holders of which shall have been entitled to vote at the previous annual meeting of shareholders, or in the case of all non-cumulative Preferred Stock until non-cumulative dividends have been paid or declared and set apart for payment for four consecutive quarterly dividend periods on all non-cumulative Preferred Stock, the holders of which shall have been entitled to vote at the previous annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter the right of the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, to participate in the election of Directors pursuant to this Section shall terminate.
Upon termination of the right of the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, to participate in the election of Directors pursuant to this Section, the term of office of each Director then in office elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock shall terminate, and any vacancy so created may be filled as provided by the bylaws of the Corporation.
Any Director or Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class pursuant to this Section, may be removed, with or without cause, only by a vote of the holders of three-fourths of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock taken at a meeting as provided by Section 4 of Article III of these Articles of Incorporation.

Redemption.
4.1. At any time or from time to time after October 31, 1974, (but not before such time) and so long as any dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are not in arrears, the Corporation at the option of its Board of Directors, shall have the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, at a price equal to $80 per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends thereon accrued on a daily basis to the date of redemption.
4.2. Notice of every redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the date fixed for redemption, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the Corporation. In the case of a redemption of a part only of the Series A Preferred Stock the Corporation shall select by lot the shares so to be redeemed.
4.3. If notice or redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid, and if on or before the redemption date specified in such notice a sum equal to the redemption price of the shares so called for redemption shall have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, whether or not certificates for the shares so called for redemption shall have been surrendered for cancellation, such shares, from and after the date of redemption so designated, shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, the right to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the redemption price.
4.4. The Corporation may, however, at any time prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption but after such notice of redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid, deposit in trust, for the account of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, with a bank or trust company in good standing organized under the laws of the United States of America or of the State of New York, or of the State of Illinois, doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, city of New York, or in the City of Chicago, Illinois, having capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $5,000,000, designated in such notice of redemption, a sum equal to the redemption price of such shares so called for redemption, and thereupon, whether or not certificates for the shares so called for redemption shall have been surrendered for cancellation (if such notice shall state that holders of the shares so called for redemption may receive their redemption price at any time after such deposit), all shares with respect to which such deposit shall have been made shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, the right to receive dividends thereon for any period after the date so fixed for redemption shall cease to accrue and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith upon such deposit in trust cease and terminate except only (a) the rights of the holders thereof to receive from such bank or trust company, at any time after the time of such deposit, the redemption price of such shares to be redeemed, or (b) the right to exercise, on or before the close of business on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, the privileges of conversion. Any moneys so deposited by the Corporation which shall not be required for such redemption because of the exercise of any such right of conversion, shall be repaid to the Corporation forthwith. Any moneys so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of six years from the date fixed for such redemption shall be repaid to the Corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Directors, after which repayment the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for the payment thereof.
 
 
 
 
 
4.5. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed shall, after the Corporation takes appropriate steps required or permitted by the laws of Indiana, have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue shall not be decreased by the redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
4.6. Nothing in this Section 4 shall limit any legal right of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of the Preferred Stock at not exceeding the price at which the same may be redeemed at the option of the Corporation.
Section 5.
Conversion Rights
.
5.1. Subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 5, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of the respective holder thereof, at the office of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, and at such other place or places, if any, as the Board of Directors may determine, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock (the Common Stock) of the Corporation. In case of the redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such right of conversion shall terminate, as to the shares called for redemption, at the close of business on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, unless default shall be made in the payment of the redemption price. Upon conversion the Corporation shall make no payment or adjustment on account of unpaid dividends accrued on the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion.
5.2. The Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock shall be Common Stock as constituted at the date of this resolution, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) of Section 5.5.
5.3. Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such Series A Preferred Stock at the office of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, which certificate or certificates, if the Corporation shall so request, shall be duly endorsed to the Corporation or in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer to the Corporation or in blank, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at that office that he elects so to convert Series A Preferred Stock, and shall state in writing therein the name of or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued. Every such notice of election to convert shall constitute a contract between the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock and the Corporation, whereby the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to subscribe for the amount of Common Stock which he shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, and, in satisfaction of such subscription, to deposit the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted and to release the Corporation from all liability thereunder, and thereby the Corporation shall be deemed to agree that the surrender of the certificate or certificates for the Series A Preferred Stock and the extinguishment of liability thereon shall constitute full payment of such subscription for Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion.
5.4. As soon as practicable after such deposit of certificates for Series A Preferred Stock accompanied by the written notice and the statement above prescribed, the Corporation will issue and deliver at the office of the transfer agent to the person for whose account such Series A Preferred Stock was so surrendered, or to his nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with a cash adjustment of any fraction of a share as herein stated, if not evenly convertible. Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of such surrender of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted; and the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock on such date. The Corporation shall not be required to convert, and no surrender of Series A Preferred Stock shall be effective for that purpose, while the stock transfer books of the Corporation are closed for any purpose; but the surrender of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for conversion immediately upon the re-opening of such books, as if the conversion had been made on the date such Series A Preferred Stock was surrendered.
 
 
 
 
 
5.5. The number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
Common Stock, by reclassification or otherwise, or
the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that the holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the conversion of such share the number of shares of the Corporation which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above had such share been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. Further such adjustments shall be made whenever any of the events listed above shall occur.
(b)
  
In case of any capital reorganization or any reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation or in case of the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, or in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation of the assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, the holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share into the kind and number of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, as the case may be, by a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible; and, in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the specified adjustments) shall thereafter be applicable, as near as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.
(c)
  
In case the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than 95% of the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in Section 5.9) on the date at which a record is taken of the holders of such issuance, the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock was immediately theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of the taking of such record plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, and of which the denominator shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of the taking of such record plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such current market price per share for such date.
 
 
 
 
 
(d)
  
No adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock into which any share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 5% in the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subdivision (d) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 5.5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.
Whenever such an adjustment is to be made, the Corporation shall forthwith file with the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock, a statement signed by the President or one of the Vice Presidents of the Corporation and by its Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, stating the adjustment to be made. Such statement shall show in detail the facts requiring such adjustment. Whenever such an adjustment is to be made, the Corporation will forthwith cause a notice stating the adjustment to be mailed to the respective holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock. Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of a notice required to be mailed under the provisions of the following paragraph of this Section 5.5.
In case at any time:
(i)
  
the Corporation shall pay any dividend payable in stock upon its Common Stock or make any distribution (other than cash dividends) to the holders of its Common Stock; or
(ii)
  
the Corporation shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its Common Stock any additional shares of stock of any class or any other rights; or
(iii)
  
the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation shall be proposed by the Corporation;
then in any one or more of those cases, the Corporation shall cause at least fifteen days prior notice to be mailed to the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and to the holders of record of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock of the date on which (x) the books of the Corporation shall close, or a record be taken for such stock dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or (y) such consolidation or merger or conveyance shall take place, as the case may be. Such notice shall also specify the date as of which holders of Common Stock of record shall participate in the dividend, distribution or subscription rights or shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, as the case may be, and shall specify the proposed transactions in reasonable detail.
5.6. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue shall not be decreased by the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
5.7. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Corporation shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of Indiana increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.
 
 
 
 
 
5.8. No fractions of shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion. In the event that because of any adjustments required to be made by Section 5.5 fractions of shares of Common Stock would be required to be issued upon conversion, the Corporation will, in lieu of issuing such fractions of shares, pay to the person otherwise entitled to such fractions the cash value of such fractions based upon the current market price (as defined in Section 5.9) per share of Common Stock on the day prior to that on which shares of Series A Preferred Stock are surrendered by such person for conversion.
5.9. The current market price per share of Common Stock as to any specified day shall be deemed to be the last reported sale price of the Common Stock for such day (or, if there is no sale on such day, the last bid quotation for the Common Stock) on the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on a national securities exchange designated by the Corporation) or, if the Common Stock is not listed upon any national securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked quotations for the Common Stock for such day as furnished by the trading department of any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Corporation for the purpose and deemed by it to be reliable. If an exchange was not open, or if the Common Stock was not traded on an exchange or elsewhere, on a day as of which the current market price is to be determined, the determination of price or quotation shall be made as of the last business day before such day.
5.10. The Corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the Series A Preferred Stock so converted was registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
5.11. The Corporation covenants that if any shares of Common Stock, required to be reserved for purposes of conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock hereunder, require registration with, or approval of, any governmental authority under any federal or state law or listing on any national securities exchange, before such shares may be issued upon conversion, the Corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible take such action as may be necessary to secure such registration or approval or listing on the relevant national securities exchange, as the case may be.

________
(the Date of Grant), and Grantees acceptance of the Option in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Lincoln National Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Effective May 10, 2007 (the Plan) and this Agreement.
LNC and Grantee hereby agree as follows:
1.
 
Shares Optioned and Option Price
Grantee shall have an Option to purchase _________ shares of LNC common stock (the Shares) for $_____________ (United States dollars) for each Share, such price to equal the Fair Market Value of the Share of LNC common stock as of the Date of Grant.
2.
 
Vesting Dates
The Option for unvested Shares shall vest on the
earlier
of:
(a) the first anniversary of Grant Date, or
(b) the date on which the Grantee terminates service (resigns or retires) as a director of LNC for any reason, or
(c) the date on which there is a Change in Control of the Corporation, as that term is defined in the Lincoln National Corporation Executive Severance Benefit Plan.
3.
 
Exercise Period
Grantee (or Grantees Beneficiary (as defined in the Plan), if applicable) may exercise all or part of the Option for vested Shares on any LNC business day at LNCs executive offices until the first to occur of:
4.
 
Manner of Exercise
To exercise an Option, Grantee must, on an LNC business day, (1) deliver, mail or fax written notice of the exercise (in the form specified by LNC) to the designated LNC stock option administrator, and (2) submit full payment of the exercise price and the certification of compliance described in paragraph 5 below. Payment may be made in any combination of cash, personal check, or Shares. Such Shares must be owned for at least six months and will constitute payment to the extent of their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise (as defined in the Plan).
 
 
 
 
 
5.
 
Restrictions on Transfer of Shares Upon Exercise
As soon as practicable after the exercise date, LNC shall cause the appropriate number of Shares to be issued to Grantee. If the Shares are subject to tax withholding requirements, LNC shall not issue Shares until the required tax withholding payments are remitted to LNC by Grantee. Grantee may surrender Shares to LNC in payment of the exercise price associated with this Option. In addition, Grantee may satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with the exercise of this Option by surrendering Shares to LNC, or by the withholding of Shares by LNC.
With the exception of the withholding of Shares by LNC to pay taxes, or the surrendering of Shares to LNC to pay exercise price or taxes, as described in the preceding paragraph, Grantee may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or otherwise encumber Shares issued as the result of exercise during his or her tenure as a director of LNC. Shares may be freely sold and transferred (subject to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules) only after the director has terminated service as a director of LNC.
LNC shall not be obligated to issue Shares to Grantee if such action violates any provision of law or regulation of any governmental authority or national securities exchange. Grantee represents that Grantee is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to distribution.
6.

The rights under this Agreement may be exercised during the lifetime of Grantee only by Grantee. After Grantees death, the Option may be exercised, to the extent exercisable and for the period specified in Section 3(b), by the person or persons to whom the Option was transferred by will or the laws of descent or distribution.
