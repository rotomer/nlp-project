A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will, shall and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among others: legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, Lincolns products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital requirements related to secondary guarantees under universal life and variable annuity products such as Actuarial Guideline VACARVM, restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments, and the potential for U.S. Federal tax reform; the initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against Lincoln or its subsidiaries and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings; changes in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income, the margins of Lincolns fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand for Lincolns products; a decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of Lincolns products, a reduction of asset fees that Lincoln charges on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of Lincolns variable annuity products; Ineffectiveness of Lincolns various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of declines in and volatility of the equity markets; a deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from Lincolns assumptions used in pricing its products, in establishing related insurance reserves, and in the amortization of intangibles that may result in an increase in reserves and a decrease in net income, including as a result of investor-owned life insurance business; lowering of one or more of Lincolns debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and the adverse impact such action may have on Lincolns ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition; lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of Lincolns insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, and profitability of its insurance subsidiaries; changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that may result in unanticipated changes to Lincolns net income; significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in the portfolios of Lincolns companies requiring that Lincoln realize losses on such investments; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including Lincolns ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions; acts of terrorism, war, or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect Lincolns businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance; competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that Lincoln can charge for its products; the unknown impact on Lincolns business resulting from changes in the demographics of Lincolns client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; loss of key management and other employees; changes in general economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may be less favorable than expected and may affect foreign exchange rates, premium levels, claims experience, the level of pension benefit costs and funding, and investment results.
 
            The risks included here are not exhaustive. Lincolns annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact Lincolns business and financial performance.  Moreover, Lincoln operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on Lincolns business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this release.
