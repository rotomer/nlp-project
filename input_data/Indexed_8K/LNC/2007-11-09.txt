Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of  Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 5, 2007, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors took the following actions:
(1)           Approved changes to our executive retirement program, converting it from a mixture of defined contribution and defined benefit programs to an entirely defined contribution retirement program.  To accomplish this, the Committee approved:
The converted actuarial equivalent lump sum amounts from the ESSB and SCP will be credited to a special opening account in the DC SERP.  the named executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table of our proxy statement in connection with the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders who are currently employed by us (NEOs)
In both cases, the accrued benefits will be calculated as if the executives were to receive a distribution at age 62, reduced under the relevant age 62 early retirement reduction factors provided under each plan (as if the executive had remained employed until age 62).  Of
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on  April 4, 2007 (Proxy Statement)
, only Dennis R. Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer, participated in the ESSB; Frederick J. Crawford, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Westley V. Thompson, President, Employer Markets, participated in the SCP.  SCP opening balance accounts will vest upon the executives attainment of age 55 or older with 5 years of service.  The present value of the accumulated ESSB and SCP benefits for Messrs. Glass, Crawford and Thompson under such plans at December 31, 2006 is set forth in the Pension Benefits table on page 53 of our Proxy Statement.  The ESSB and SCP are described on pages 55-56 of our Proxy Statement.

In addition to continuing to allow officers to defer salary and bonus, the DC SERP will also act as an excess 401(k) plan accepting employee and employer contributions in excess of applicable Internal Revenue Service limits (IRS limits) or otherwise required by operation of the Lincoln National Corporation Employees Savings and Profit-Sharing Plan (renamed the Lincoln National Corporation Savings & Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2008), our tax-qualified 401(k) plan.  In connection with freezing our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans, we are amending our 401(k) plan for all employees (except those employed by Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., or Delaware)  to add a 4% core contribution and a potential transition contribution of 0.2% to 8% for certain employees and executives based on age and years of service as of December 31, 2007 (both contributions are based on annual salary and annual incentive bonus), as well as increasing the basic matching contributions from 50% of eligible deferrals (capped at 6% of eligible compensation) to 100% of eligible deferrals (capped at 6% of eligible compensation).  Accordingly, any core contributions or transition contributions that cannot be contributed to the 401(k) plan due to the operation of plan or IRS limits will be contributed to the DC SERP.  In addition, the 401(k) plans discretionary matching contribution will be eliminated effective as of January 1, 2008, except for those employed by Delaware.
For all current executive officers (except Patrick P. Coyne who is President of Lincoln National Investment Company, Inc. and Delaware), a special executive credit will be calculated as: 15% of total pay expressed as a percentage, offset by the total of: (a) the executive officers maximum basic matching contribution opportunity (6%), plus (b) core contributions (4%), plus (c) transition contribution, if any (0.2% -8%) as determined under the 401(k) Plan, each expressed as a percentage.  For Mr. Coyne, the amount of the special executive credit will be calculated as: 15% of total pay expressed in dollars, offset by the total of: (a) the amount of his maximum basic matching contribution opportunity (3% of total pay), plus (b) the amount of any discretionary matching contribution, plus (c) the employer contribution under the Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. Retirement Plan (7.5% of annual base pay and annual bonus, but with bonus amounts over $100,000 capped at 50%), each expressed in dollars.  For the purpose of determining the special executive credit, total pay is equal to annual base pay plus annual bonus.  The special executive credits for the NEOs will be Mr. Glass--0%; Mr. Crawford--5%; and Mr. Thompson1.4%.  Mr. Coynes special executive credit will vary from year to year depending on whether a discretionary matching contribution is paid to Delaware employees, but in no event, will his special executive credit exceed 5% of total pay in any year.  Effective 2018, the special executive credit will equal 5% for each executive officer, except Delaware executive officers (whose special executive credit will continue to vary), as a result of the expiration of the transition contributions.
Special executive credits will vest on the earlier of five years of receiving special executive credits under the Plan, or attainment of age 62.  However, executive officers as of January 1, 2008 will be immediately vested in their special executive credits.
For executive officers on December 31, 2007 only, any shortfall between their retirement benefits targeted as a percentage of final pay at age 62, and the sum of their (1) accrued benefits under the current defined benefit retirement program (qualified and non-qualified), (2) hypothetical maximum employer contributions (basic match and discretionary match) in both qualified and non-qualified savings plans, (3) projected core contributions, transition contributions, and any special executive credits projected to age 62 based on various assumptions (including but not limited to annual base salary increases, investment earnings, lump sum conversion interest rate, annuitization rate, and future bonus amounts), and (4) ESSB and SCP opening account balances projected to age 62 also based on various assumptions (including, but not limited to, investment earnings and lump sum conversion rates) will be converted to a present value lump sum and contributed to a special shortfall balance account in the DC SERP.  The shortfall balance accounts for the executive officers, including for the NEOs, will be calculated based upon accrued benefits at year-end. Each executives shortfall balance account, if any, will have an individualized phased vesting schedule beginning on the later of: (i) January 1, 2008 or (ii) attainment of at least age 55 and five years of service and ending on the first month after the executive reaches age 62.

The DC SERP will provide executives with benefit enhancements upon our change of control, as defined under the Lincoln National Corporation Executive Severance Benefit Plan.  Any unvested SCP opening account balances and special executive credits will immediately vest upon the change of control.  ESSB opening account balances are already 100% vested as a result of the April 3, 2006 change of control of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation.  In addition, upon a separation from service within the two-year period following a change of control, the following benefit enhancements will be provided to the executive:
(2)           Approved the 2008 annual incentive program (AIP) target and long-term incentive program (LTI) target for the 2008-2010 performance cycle as a percentage of salary.  Both programs operate under our Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Program, and amounts will be paid or vest only if the performance measures, which the Compensation Committee has not yet set, are satisfied.  Total targeted direct compensation, which comprises base salary, AIP and LTI, was increased from 2007 by less than 3.5% in the aggregate for the NEOs.   In addition, for the NEOs as a group, target LTI as a percentage of base salary did not change from 2007 and target AIP as a percentage of base salary changed by less than 3.5%.  The 2008 target AIP and LTI, respectively, each expressed as a percentage of base salary for the NEOs are as follows: Mr. Glass200%; 500%; Mr. Crawford110%; 281%; Mr. Coyne370%; 337%; and Mr. Thompson136%; 339%.  Unless and until we disclose changes to target AIP and LTI as a percentage of base salary, investors should assume that these percentages have not materially changed in future periods.
Awards, if any, will be paid out or vest after the end of the applicable performance period only upon the Compensation Committees determination that threshold performance has been achieved.  A maximum of AIP and LTI award of 200% of target will be paid or vest when performance is superior, and a minimum award of 50% of target will be paid or vest when a threshold level of performance is met.  One-half of the LTI award is expected to be paid out in stock options.
The Compensation Committee also approved changes to the base salaries for the NEOs effective January 1, 2008, which do not differ materially from what we have previously reported in our .

(3)           Approved an amendment and restatement to the Delaware Investments U.S., Inc. (DIUS) Stock Option Plan, which was renamed the DIUS Incentive Compensation Plan (the DIUS ICP).  Mr. Coyne is eligible to participate in the DIUS ICP as an employee of Delaware and holds both vested and unvested options to purchase DIUS shares.  The DIUS ICP was amended and restated as an omnibus equity compensation plan that permits the grant of equity awards other than stock options, such as: stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units.  However, because DIUS stock is not publicly traded, an independent valuation firm performs periodic valuations of DIUS to determine the fair market value (FMV) of the DIUS stock underlying all forms of equity granted pursuant to the DIUS ICP.  The valuation guidelines take a market transaction approach to valuation, considering three commonly applied benchmarks in the asset management industry: (a) assets under management, (b) price to revenues, and (c) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as well as comparable market transactions.  Prior to the amendment and restatement, valuations were performed bi-annually (June 30 and December 31), but now will be performed quarterly (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31).

The DIUS ICP also decreases the length of time that a participant who has received  shares from an award may put those shares back to DIUS following the release of valuations from 60 days to 15 days.  Because the DIUS stock is not publicly traded, its FMV can be affected positively or negatively by intercompany transactions that add or remove earnings, revenues or assets under management from DIUS without a reciprocal transaction.  To avoid an inequitable impact to DIUS stockholders and participants in the DIUS ICP due to such transactions, the DIUS ICP
As a result of several non-reciprocal intercompany transactions that occurred after the December 31, 2006 valuation of the DIUS stock, the Compensation Committee also approved a $7.57 reduction to the exercise price of all outstanding DIUS options granted prior to November 5, 2007.  As a result, the exercise price of Mr. Coynes DIUS options are:

4.         
Stock Subject to Plan.
(a)           Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8(c) hereof, the total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for delivery in connection with Awards under the Plan shall be 2,500,000; provided, however, that the total number of shares of Stock with respect to which ISOs may be granted shall not exceed 1,000,000.

Overall Number of Shares Available for Delivery.
(b)           No Award may be granted if the number of shares of Stock to be delivered in connection with such Award or, in the case of an Award measured solely by the increase in value of shares of stock settleable only in cash (such as cash-only SARs), the number of shares to which the Award relates, exceeds the number of shares of Stock remaining available under the Plan minus the number of shares of Stock issuable in settlement of or relating to then-outstanding Awards.

Application of Limitation to Grants of Awards.
(c)           Shares of Stock subject to an Award under the Plan (i) which Award is canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without a delivery of shares to the Participant, including the number of shares surrendered in payment of any taxes relating to any Award, or (ii) which shares are repurchased by the Corporation pursuant to Section 4(d), 4(e) or 7(b) hereof will again be available for Awards under the Plan, except that if any such shares could not again be available for Awards to a particular Participant under any applicable law or regulation, such shares shall be available exclusively for Awards to Participants who are not subject to such limitation.
Availability of Shares Not Delivered under Awards.
(d)         .  Upon or after a Participants (or Stock holders) termination of employment with the Corporation and all its affiliates, the Corporation or DIUS may call all shares of Stock held by the Participant (or Stock holder).  In addition, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, require the Corporation or DIUS to call shares of Stock.  Subject to the following sentence, called shares of Stock will be reacquired by the Corporation or DIUS as soon as practicable after the call for an amount per share equal to (1) the Fair Market Value of a share as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of the call if the call occurs before the expiration of the period after the Valuation Date during which the shares may be put to the Corporation or DIUS (in accordance with Section 4(e) below), or (2) the Fair Market Value of a share as of the Valuation Date following the date of the call if the call occurs after the expiration of the period after the preceding Valuation Date during which the shares may be put to the Corporation or DIUS (in accordance with Section 4(e) below).  However, in the case of an outstanding share acquired as the result of the exercise of an Option occurring prior to November 8, 2006, the Corporation or DIUS will pay to such Stock holder the Fair Market Value of such share determined as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, less $11.31.  In the case of an outstanding share acquired as the result of the exercise of an Option occurring after November 8, 2006 but prior to November 5, 2007, the Corporation or DIUS will pay to such Stock holder the Fair Market Value of such share determined as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus $7.57.
Call Feature
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) shares that have been held for six months or less as of the date of a call will not be called as of that date, but will be called on the date as of which the Stock holder has held the shares for six months and one day for an amount equal to the amount determined in accordance with the preceding paragraph, and (2) the Corporation or DIUS may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, delay calling shares held by a Stock holder for less than one year until the day after the first anniversary of the date on which the Stock holder acquired such shares, in which case the shares will be reacquired by the Corporation or DIUS for an amount determined in accordance with the preceding paragraph.  Shares called other than in connection with termination of employment will be called from each holder of Stock in proportion to the holders total Stock holdings.
(e)         .  An individual who has acquired shares upon the exercise of an Option or otherwise pursuant to the grant or settlement of an Award and has held those shares for more than six months may put the shares back to the Corporation (or, if directed by the Corporation, to DIUS), Shares may be put to the Corporation (or, if directed by the Corporation, to DIUS) only during the 15-day period beginning on the date on which valuation results are communicated to Stock holders, and the Corporation (or, if directed by the Corporation, DIUS) will pay to the Stock holder the Fair Market Value determined as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the length of the put period beginning on the date on which valuation results are communicated to Stock holders may be modified by the Committee or the Corporation provided that the change in put period does not represent a material and adverse change affecting the Stock holders.  Further, the President of the Corporation may, in his or her complete discretion, announce additional terms and conditions (including, but not limited to Stock ownership requirements, which additional terms and conditions may be outside of a Participants original Award documentation) that must be met before a Participant can exercise the put option.  In addition, in the case of an outstanding share acquired as the result of the exercise of an Option occurring prior to November 8, 2006, the Corporation or DIUS will pay to such Stock holder the Fair Market Value of such share determined as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, less $11.31.  In the case of an outstanding share acquired as the result of the exercise of an Option occurring after November 8, 2006 and prior to November 5, 2007, the Corporation or DIUS will pay to such Stock holder the Fair Market Value of such share determined as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus $7.57.
Put Option
At the Corporations sole discretion, the amount the Corporation is required to pay pursuant to the preceding sentence may be paid in (i) cash, (ii) a promissory note (in substantially the form of the note attached hereto as Appendix B) that requires payment over a period not to exceed five years with interest each year at a rate equal to the rate paid on Treasury notes of similar term and similar subordination plus the increment over that rate paid on borrowings of similar term and similar subordination by Lincoln with such note to be guaranteed by Lincoln (with a guaranty in substantially the form of the agreement attached hereto as Appendix C), (iii) freely tradable shares of common stock of Lincoln having a market value on the date of transfer to the employee equal to the amount payable to the employee, or (iv) any combination of (i) and (ii) or (i) and (iii).

The Committee shall (subject to Section 8(e) and the provisos therein) retain full power and discretion to accelerate, waive or modify, at any time, any term or condition of an Award that is not mandatory under the Plan.  Except in cases in which the Committee is authorized to require other forms of consideration under the Plan, or to the extent other forms of consideration must be paid to satisfy the requirements of Delaware law, no consideration other than services may be required for the grant (but not the exercise) of any Award.
General.
(b)           The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Participants on the following terms and conditions:
Options.
(i)           The exercise price per share of Stock purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the Committee, provided that such exercise price shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of such Option.
Exercise Price.
(ii)           The Committee shall determine, at the date of grant or thereafter, the time or times at which or the circumstances under which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on completion of future service requirements), the methods by which such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such payment, including, without limitation, cash, Stock (including Stock acquired in connection with the exercise of an Option) or through a cashless exercise procedure, and the methods by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants.
Time and Method of Exercise.
(iii)                   The terms of any ISO granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Code Section 422.  Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of the Plan relating to ISOs shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify either the Plan or any ISO under Code Section 422, unless the Participant has first requested the change that will result in such disqualification.
ISOs.

(iv)                   The term of each Option shall be for such period as may be determined by the Committee; provided that in no event shall the term of any Option exceed a period of ten years (or such shorter term as may be required in respect of an ISO under Code Section 422).
Term of Options.
(c)         Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Participants on the following terms and conditions:
(i)           A SAR shall confer on the Participant to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of exercise over (B) the grant price of the SAR as determined by the Committee.  The grant price of a SAR shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of such SAR.
Right to Payment.
(ii)           The Committee shall determine, at the date of grant or thereafter, the time or times at which and the circumstances under which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including, without limitation, based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, method by or forms in which any Stock payable will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants, whether or not a SAR shall be in tandem or in combination with any other Award, and any other terms and conditions of any SAR.  Limited SARs that may only be exercised in connection with a Change of Control or other events as specified by the Committee may be granted on such terms, not inconsistent with this Section 6(c), as the Committee may determine.

Except to the extent restricted under any Award agreement relating to the Restricted Stock, a Participant granted Restricted Stock shall have the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends thereon (subject to any mandatory reinvestment or other requirement imposed by the Committee or President as provided herein).

Certificates for Stock.
(iv)                   As a condition to the grant of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee may require that any cash dividends paid on a share of Restricted Stock be automatically reinvested in additional shares of Restricted Stock or applied to the purchase of additional Awards under the Plan.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Stock distributed in connection with a Stock split or Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Stock or other property has been distributed.

(f)         .  Unless the Award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel any outstanding Award at any time, and the Corporation shall have the additional rights set forth in Section 6(f)(iv) below, if the Participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award agreement and the Plan including the following conditions:
Cancellation and Rescission of Awards
(i)  A Participant shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the judgment of the President of the Corporation or other senior officer designated by the Committee, is or becomes competitive with the Corporation.  For Participants whose employment has terminated, the judgment of the President or other senior officer designated by the Committee shall be based on the Participants position and responsibilities while employed by the Corporation, the Participants post-employment responsibilities and position with the other organization or business, the extent of past, current and potential competition or conflict between the Corporation and the other organization or business, the effect on the Corporations shareholders, customers, suppliers and competitors of the Participant assuming the post-employment position and such other considerations as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and circumstances.  A Participant shall be free, however, to purchase as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities of such organization or business so long as they are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter, and such investment does not represent a greater than five percent equity interest in the organization or business.
(ii)  A Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from the Corporation, disclose to anyone outside the Corporation, or use in other than the Corporations business, any confidential information or material relating to the business of the Corporation that is acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the Corporation.
(iii)  A Participant shall disclose promptly and assign to the Corporation all right, title, and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the Participant during employment by the Corporation, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of the Corporation and shall do anything reasonably necessary to enable the Corporation to secure a patent where appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries.
(iv)  Upon exercise, settlement, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award, the Participant shall certify on a form acceptable to the Committee that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 6(f) prior to, or during the six months after, any exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award shall cause such exercise, payment or delivery to be rescinded. The Corporation shall notify the Participant in writing of any such rescission within two years after such exercise, payment or delivery; provided, however, that the Corporation may, in its discretion, in any individual case provide for waiver in whole or in part of compliance with the provisions of this Section 6(f).  Within ten days after receiving such a notice from the Corporation, the Participant shall pay to the Corporation the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award.  Such payment shall be made either in cash or by returning to the Corporation the number of shares of Stock that the Participant received in connection with the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery.  In the case of any Participant whose employment is terminated by the Corporation and its subsidiaries without cause (as defined in the Award agreement), however, a failure of the Participant to comply with the provisions of Section 6(f)(i) after such termination of employment shall not in itself cause rescission or require repayment with respect to any Award exercised, paid or delivered before such termination.

7.          Unless otherwise provided in the Award agreement:
Change of Control.
(a)  In the event of a Change of Control of Lincoln, (i) any Award of an Option or SAR carrying a right to exercise that was not previously exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested as of the time of the Change of Control of Lincoln and shall remain exercisable and vested for the balance of the stated term of such Award without regard to any termination of employment by the Participant, subject only to applicable restrictions set forth in Section 8(a)hereof and (ii) any restrictions and forfeiture conditions applicable to any RSU or Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall lapse and such Award shall be deemed fully vested as of the time of the Change in Control, except to the extent of any waiver by the Participant and subject to applicable restrictions set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, provided that a Change of Control shall not accelerate payment of any such fully vested Award that is subject to Code Section 409A unless such Change of Control also qualifies as a "change in control event" as described under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v).
 
(b)  In the event of a Change of Control of the Corporation or DIUS that occurs within one year after shares are called in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d) from an individual other than an individual from whom the shares are called as a result of the individuals termination of employment, the individual will receive a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the Change of Control Price over the amount paid for a share of Stock pursuant to the call, multiplied by the number of shares called from the individual. In the event that a Change of Control of DIUS occurs in connection with a Change of Control of the Corporation in which the Change of Control Price is set in a manner that does not indicate a specific Change of Control Price for DIUS, such an individual will receive a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Stock as determined on the most recent Valuation Date on or before the Change in Control of DIUS over the amount paid for a share of stock pursuant to the call, multiplied by the number of shares called from the individual.  Any such payment under this Section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Change of Control, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Change of Control.
8.         
General Provisions.
(a)           The Corporation may, to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee, postpone the issuance or delivery of Stock or payment of other benefits under any Award until completion of such registration or qualification of such Stock or other required action under any federal or state law, rule or regulation, listing or other required action with respect to any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Stock or other securities of the Corporation may in the future be listed or quoted, or compliance with any other obligation of the Corporation, as the Committee may consider appropriate, and may require any Participant to make such representations, furnish such information and comply with or be subject to such other conditions as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Stock or payment of other benefits in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, listing requirements, or other obligations.  The foregoing notwithstanding, in connection with a Change of Control, the Corporation shall take or cause to be taken no action, and shall undertake or permit to arise no legal or contractual obligation, that results or would result in any postponement of the issuance or delivery of Stock or payment of benefits under any Award or the imposition of any other conditions on such issuance, delivery or payment, to the extent that such postponement or other condition would represent a greater burden on a Participant than existed on the 90th day preceding the Change of Control.
Compliance with Legal and Other Requirements.

(b)           No Award or other right or interest of a Participant under the Plan shall be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability of such Participant to any party (other than the Corporation or a subsidiary), or assigned or transferred by such Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon the death of a Participant, and such Awards or rights that may be exercisable shall be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative, except that Awards and other rights (other than ISOs and SARs in tandem therewith) may be transferred to one or more Beneficiaries or other transferees during the lifetime of the Participant, and may be exercised by such transferees in accordance with the terms of such Option, but only if and to the extent such transfers are permitted by the Committee pursuant to the express terms of an Award agreement (subject to any terms and conditions which the Committee may impose thereon).  A Beneficiary, transferee, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award agreement applicable to such Participant, except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
(c)           In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Stock, or other property), recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, acquisition, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, non-reciprocal inter-company transaction, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction or event (including a material change in intercompany pricing methodologies) affects the Stock such that an adjustment to outstanding Awards or the number of shares of Stock held by a Participant or Stock holder is required to preserve (or prevent enlargement of) the benefits or potential benefits intended at the time of grant, then in such manner as the Committee deems equitable, an appropriate adjustment must be made to any or all of (i) the number and kind of shares of Stock (or other securities substituted for Stock as the Committee determines) held by a Participant or Stock holder, (ii) the number and kind of shares of Stock (or other securities substituted for Stock as the Committee determines) which may be delivered in connection with Awards granted thereafter, (iii) the number and kind of shares of Stock (or other securities substituted for Stock as the Committee determines) subject to or deliverable in respect of outstanding Awards and (iv) the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any Award and/or the Committee shall make provision for payment of cash or other property in respect of any outstanding Award.  In determining the appropriate adjustment to be made, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (x) the restrictions of applicable law, (y) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (z) the possibility that some Participants might receive an adjustment or a distribution of some other benefit that is unintended, and in light of certain factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery shares of Stock or make other equitable adjustments.  Any such adjustments shall also apply to Stock held by a Participant or Stock holder that was acquired pursuant to the exercise, payment, settlement or vesting of an Award.  Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards or the number of shares of Stock held by a Participant or Stock holder will be effected in a manner that precludes enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards and will be made in a manner that will not be treated under Code Section 409A as the grant of a new Option or SAR.  Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding.  In addition, the Committee is authorized (subject to Section 8(e) and the provisos therein) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets) affecting the Corporation, any subsidiary or any business unit, or the financial statements of the Corporation or any subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations or business conditions or in view of the Committees assessment of the business strategy of the Corporation, any subsidiary or business unit thereof, performance of comparable organizations, economic and business conditions, personal performance of a Participant, and any other circumstances deemed relevant.
Adjustments.

(d)           The Corporation and any affiliate is authorized to withhold from any payment to a Participant amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Corporation and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award.  This authority shall include authority to withhold or receive Stock held more or less than six months, or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participants tax obligations (not to exceed the minimum statutorily required tax withholding), either on a mandatory or elective basis in the discretion of the Committee.
Taxes.
(e)           The Board, or the Committee acting pursuant to such authority as may be delegated to it by the Board, may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or the Committees authority to grant Awards under the Plan, provided that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Board action may materially and adversely affect the rights of a Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award.  Any adjustment pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall not be treated as materially and adversely affecting the rights of a Participant or a Stock holder.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award agreement relating thereto, except as otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under such Award. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if any right under this Plan would cause a transaction to be ineligible for pooling of interest accounting that would, but for the right hereunder, be eligible for such accounting treatment, the Committee may modify or adjust the right so that pooling of interest accounting shall be available, including the substitution of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the cash otherwise payable hereunder for the right which caused the transaction to be ineligible for pooling of interest accounting.
Changes to the Plan and Awards.

(f)           Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant the right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in the employ or service of the Corporation or a subsidiary, (ii) interfering in any way with the right of the Corporation or a subsidiary to terminate any Eligible Persons or Participants employment or service at any time, (iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan or to be treated uniformly with other Participants and employees, or (iv) conferring on a Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Corporation (including the right to vote shares of Stock or receive dividends) unless and until the Participant is duly issued or transferred shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of an Award.
Limitation on Rights Conferred under Plan.
(g)           The adoption of the Plan by the Board shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or a committee thereof to adopt such other compensation and incentive arrangements for employees, agents and brokers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries as it may deem desirable.
Nonexclusivity of the Plan.
(h)           Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of a forfeiture of an Award with respect to which a Participant paid cash or other consideration, the Participant shall be repaid the amount of such cash or other consideration.
Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional Shares.
(i)           The validity, construction and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan, and any Award agreement shall be determined in accordance with Delaware law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.

General
 
The Market Transaction Approach is a top down approach to business valuation which involves valuing a company based on the market valuation of entire companies that have been sold or the prices at which significant interests in companies have been transacted.  Although each business entity may be regarded as a unique income producing enterprise, the fair market values of DIUS can be estimated by computing the multiples of various performance measures using actual transaction prices paid for similar investment management companies.
 
Application
 
To estimate the respective fair market values of DIUS, an independent valuation firm will consider three commonly applied valuation benchmarks in the asset management industry: price to assets under management (AUM); price to revenues; and, price to earnings before taxes, amortization and depreciation (EBITDA).  The sub-advised assets will be valued separately from the advised assets, and the independent valuation firm may, in its judgment, apply different median multiples to the sub-advised assets than used for the advised assets.  In addition, the independent valuation firm may, in its judgment, apply certain non-operating assets and liabilities to adjust the valuation.
 
For the purposes of the Plan, the independent valuation firm will consistently apply the following weightings to median multiples to arrive at estimates of fair market value for DIUS:

Committee/Appraiser Coordination
 
In the event of any corporate transaction or any other event which the appraiser reasonably believes should, in order to provide consistency and fairness, result in an adjustment to the Fair Market Value or in an adjustment to the exercise price, grant price, number of options or shares or other feature of the plan, the appraiser shall consult with and coordinate with the Committee (see Section 8(c) of the Plan) to determine what adjustments are appropriate and that those adjustments are correctly and consistently applied.  Changes to the valuation methodology shall be approved by the Committee.
