Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 13, 2007, we posted slides to be used in connection with our 2007 Conference for Investors and Bankers, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in the slides along with our reasons for using them are set forth below.  Reconciliations are at the end of the slides.
Definition of Income (Loss) from Operations and ROE
Income (loss) from operations and ROE, as used in the slides and presentation, are non-GAAP financial measures and are not substitutes for net income (loss) and ROE, calculated using GAAP measures. Income (loss) from operations represents after tax results excluding, as applicable, realized gains or losses on investments and derivatives, cumulative effect of accounting changes, reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance, gain on sale of subsidiaries and book of business and loss on early retirement of debt. The earnings used to calculate ROE, as used in the earnings release, are income (loss) from operations. Income (loss) from operations is an internal measure used by the company in the management of its operations. Management believes that this performance measure explains the results of the company's ongoing operations in a manner that allows  for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's current business because the excluded items are either unpredictable and/or not related to decisions regarding the underlying businesses.
Definition of Book Value per share excluding AOCI
Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. We believe book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
