Exhibit 10.1

LNC and Grantee agree as follows:
________________
             
1.             Grantee is awarded Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) subject to the terms and restrictions as set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement.  In the event an adjustment pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Plan is required, the number of RSUs awarded under this Agreement and/or the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to RSUs granted under this Agreement shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Plan.  All RSUs after such adjustment (and/or shares of LNC common stock issuable pursuant to an RSU granted under this Agreement) shall be subject to the same restrictions applicable to such RSUs (and/or shares of LNC common stock issuable pursuant to an RSU granted under this Agreement) before the adjustment.

2.              Neither the RSUs granted under this Agreement, nor any interest or right therein or part thereof, shall be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, margined or otherwise encumbered by the Grantee.  The RSUs shall be subject to the restrictions in this Paragraph 2 until such time as shares are distributed in settlement of the RSUs, as described in Paragraph 7 below.

3.           .  Grantee shall have no voting rights with respect to RSUs.
Voting Rights
 
4.             Any RSUs may be cancelled by action of the Committee or its delegate if Grantee is terminated for Cause (as defined below), or fails to comply with the non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and/or non-disclosure provisions described below in subparagraphs 4(a) through 4(d) below before shares are distributed in settlement of the RSUs, as described in Paragraph 7.  Failure to comply with the provisions in 4(a) through 4(d) during the six month period after shares are distributed in settlement of the RSUs, or termination for Cause at any time after distribution, will result in the rescission of the award.  LNC must notify Grantee in writing of any such rescission.  LNC, in its discretion, may waive compliance with this provision in whole or part in any individual case.  Within ten days of receiving a rescission notice from LNC, Grantee must repay the award to LNC.  Such payment by Grantee must be made either in cash or by returning the shares Grantee received in connection with the rescinded award.  If Grantees employment is terminated by LNC and its subsidiaries other than for fraud or fidelity crimes, a failure of Grantee to comply with the non-competition provisions after such termination shall not in itself cause rescission of the award, if the distribution of shares occurred prior to termination.  At the time shares are to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement, Grantee shall certify on a form acceptable to the Committee that Grantee is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, and with the provisions in subparagraphs 4(a) through 4(d) below.
