Commission pursuant to Rule 424, (ii) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(ii) As soon as practicable but in any event not later than eighteen months after the deemed effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), the Company will make generally available to its securityholders and to the Representatives a consolidated earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including at the option of the Company Rule 158 under the Act).
(iii) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Representatives, without charge, a signed copy of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference) and will deliver to the Representatives during the period mentioned in Section 4(a)(v) or 4(a)(vii) below, as many copies of the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any documents incorporated therein by reference therein and any supplements and amendments thereto or to the Registration Statement as you may reasonably request.
(iv) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Representatives, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Representatives and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the
 
Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(v) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Representatives the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Representatives, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(vi) The Company shall cause the Securities to be listed on the Exchange not later than the Closing Date.
(vii) The Company will promptly from time to time arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities, and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise subject.
 
(viii) The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, any Blue Sky Survey, any Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all fees and expenses in connection with the listing of the Securities on the Exchange and any other stock exchanges; (iv) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities and Blue Sky laws as provided in Section 4(a)(vii) hereof, including any reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Representatives in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee, Paying Agent, or Transfer Agent and counsel for any such Trustee, Paying Agent or Transfer Agent in connection with the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 6 and Section 7 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of its own costs and expenses, including the fees of its counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by it, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers it may make.
(ix) The Company will prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and will file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, if applicable, such other time as may be required by Rule 424(b) and file promptly and simultaneously provide the Representatives with a copy of all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities. The Company will prepare a final
 
term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, in a form approved by the Representatives and file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule, and will file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act.
(x) During a period of five years from the date of the Basic Prospectus and, provided the following are not available on the Commission's EDGAR database, to furnish to the Representatives copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders, and deliver to the Representatives (i) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with any national securities exchange on which the Securities or any class of securities of the Company is listed or, if requested by the Representatives, the Commission; and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request (provided such financial statements and reports are otherwise furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission).
(xi) The Company has given the Representatives notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations thereunder within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to make any such filing from the time of each sale of the Securities to the Closing Date or to the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, and will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Representatives or counsel for the Representatives shall reasonably object.
(xii) For a period of 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, the Company will not (i) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, file a registration statement in order to offer and sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, without the prior written consent of each of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, other than (A) the Securities to be sold hereunder, (B) the grant of options, units and rights

(b) Each Underwriter and the Company agree as follows: The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of each of the Underwriters, and each Underwriter agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433 (an "") or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the information contained in any final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(a)(i) hereto; that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the free writing prospectuses, if any, included in Schedule II hereto.

(ii) (A) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), and at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) under the Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Act, the Company was a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act; and (B) at the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Securities, the Company was not an "ineligible issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;

(v) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, such Securities will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; the issuance of such Securities will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights; and the Securities conform to the description thereof contained in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus;
(vi) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;
(vii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities and this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument to which, to the knowledge of such counsel, the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of (i) the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or (ii) any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, any subsidiary or any of its respective properties, except, in the case of (ii) above, for such violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect;

required or any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described and filed as required; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus;
(ix) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(x) Except as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending, nor to the best of such counsel's knowledge, is there any action, suit or proceeding threatened, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement; and

To such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of, any Bank Regulatory Authority which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies or its management, nor have any of them been advised by any Bank Regulatory Authority that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter or similar submission, or any such board resolutions other than where the substance of such communications, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall also state that although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently, does not express an opinion as to, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy,
 
completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus and has made no independent check or verification thereof (except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (viii) of this Section 5(b)), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that (i) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and the financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) as of its date and the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented or as amended or supplemented by any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, of Blank Rome LLP, counsel for the Company, to the effect that:
(i) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;
(ii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities and this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any Material Agreement
 
(as defined below), except for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in a violation of any of the provisions of the Act or the Exchange Act, except that such counsel expresses no opinion as to compliance with the disclosure or antifraud provisions of such federal securities laws. The term "Material Agreement" means each document filed as an Item 10 exhibit to (or incorporated as an Item 10 exhibit in) the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 or the Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. No opinion is given as to whether the Material Agreements are the only agreements material to the Company;
(iii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(iv) The statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under "Description of Securities" and "Description of Securities We May Sell  Common Stock and Preferred Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
(v) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity controlled by an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and
(vi) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, and to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof, or any notice objecting to its use, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act; the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented and any further amendments thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, (in each case other than the financial statements, financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief), appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall also state that although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently, does not express an opinion as to, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration
 
Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus and has made no independent check or verification thereof (except in connection with the rendering of the legal opinions set forth in this Section 5(c) of this Agreement), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that (i) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and the financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) as of its date and the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or as amended or supplemented by any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Solely for purposes of rendering the opinions referred to in (iii) above, Blank Rome LLP may rely, as to matters of Indiana law, on the opinion of Dennis L. Schoff, General Counsel of the Company referred to above.
(d) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Representatives, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as it requests for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon such matters.
(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or a Executive Vice President and the principal financial or
 
accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, and this Agreement and that to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation:
(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be;
(ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) Since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries has sustained any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, and there has been no material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(f) At the time this Agreement is executed and at the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, Ernst & Young LLP, as independent accountants for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated such date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex I.
(g) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, there shall not have occurred (i) any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its
 
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus or (ii) any material change or decrease in those items specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 5 the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.

(k) On or after the Applicable Time and subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's senior debt securities or the financial strength rating of any of the Company's insurance subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications or outlook, its rating of any of the Company's senior debt securities or its financial strength rating of any of the Company's insurance subsidiaries; provided, however, that in the event Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") affirms a previous announcement that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications or outlook, its rating of the Company's senior debt securities and that, in such announcement, Moody's does not downgrade its ratings of the Company's senior debt securities, such announcement shall not be considered an announcement for purposes of subsection (ii) that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications or outlook, its rating of the Company's senior debt securities.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement
 
shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, by the Underwriters. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
6. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by it in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, any other free writing prospectus (including, without limitation, any electronic road show) or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to any Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to any Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so as to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), approved by the Underwriters in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to

such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The indemnifying party shall have the right to, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party so long as such settlement (i) is limited to the payment of monetary damages only, (ii) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such proceeding and (iii) does not (x) include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party or (y) otherwise give rise to additional liabilities on the part of the indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
 
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), each Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which each Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters for Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.

Default by an Underwriter
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the non-defaulting Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the non-defaulting Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or Additional Closing Date, as applicable, for such Securities for a period of not more than five days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the counsel for the Underwriters may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 6 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Securities on the Closing Date or the Option Securities on the Additional Closing Date, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock or any preferred stock or preferred securities shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the Exchange or trading in securities generally on the Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in markets in the United States or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Firm Securities on the Closing Date or the Option Securities on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PHILADELPHIA, June 15, 2009  Lincoln Financial Group (NYSE:LNC) today announced a registered public underwritten offering of $600 million of its common shares. The underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15 percent of the offered amount of common shares from the company. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. will serve as Global Coordinators and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will serve as joint book-running managers for the offering.
The common stock offering is a part of Lincoln's broader capital plan that also includes raising up to $500 million in senior debt and targeting approximately $950 million in preferred stock. Any preferred stock would be issued pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program (CPP).
Lincoln currently intends to contribute approximately $1 billion of the proceeds to its principal insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, with the remaining $1 billion held at the holding company for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term debt and investment in the company's core businesses.
These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company's capital and liquidity, and solidify the company's capital positions at both the subsidiary and holding company levels.
Lincoln believes that participation in the CPP provides additional capital flexibility. The company expects to repay this financing as soon as practicable, taking into consideration appropriate balance sheet strength and capital markets conditions. The final level of
Lincoln's participation is expected to be announced by the end of June; in May, the company received preliminary approval for up to $2.5 billion under the program. Any participation in the CPP would be subject to final approval and finalization of terms and conditions.
The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may obtain these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at .

A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our business, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Lincoln claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Lincoln's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could impact Lincoln's business and financial performance. Moreover, Lincoln operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.

therefrom, or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) as of its date and the Closing Date, the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented or as amended or supplemented by any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Solely for purposes of rendering the opinion referred to in (iii) above, Dennis L. Schoff, General Counsel of the Company may rely, as to matters of New York law, on the opinion of Blank Rome LLP referred to below.
(c) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Blank Rome LLP, counsel for the Company, to the effect that:
(i) The Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits and security provided by the Indenture; and the Securities conform to the description thereof contained in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus;
(ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Company enforceable in accordance with its terms;
(iii) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities laws;
(iv) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any Material Agreement (as defined below), except for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result
 
in a violation of any of the provisions of the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, except that such counsel expresses no opinion as to compliance with the disclosure or antifraud provisions of such federal securities laws. The term "Material Agreement" means each document filed as an Item 10 exhibit to (or incorporated as an Item 10 exhibit in) the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 or the Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. No opinion is given as to whether the Material Agreements are the only agreements material to the Company;
(v) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(vi) The statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under "Description of Senior Notes" and "Description of Securities We May SellSenior and Subordinated Debt Securities", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
(vii) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity controlled by an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and
(viii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, and to such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof, or any notice objecting to its use, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act; the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented and any further amendments thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date, (in each case other than the financial statements, financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief), appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall also state that although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently, does not express an opinion as to, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus and has made no independent check or verification thereof (except in connection with the rendering
 
of the legal opinions set forth in this Section 5(c) of this Agreement), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have caused such counsel to believe that (i) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and the financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Time of Sale Prospectus (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) as of its date and the Closing Date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or as amended or supplemented by any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and financial data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, and the exhibits to the Registration Statement including the Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion or belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Solely for purposes of rendering the opinions referred to in (ii) and (v) above, Blank Rome LLP may rely, as to matters of Indiana law, on the opinion of Dennis L. SchoffGeneral Counsel of the Company referred to above.
,
(d) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Representatives, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as it requests for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon such matters.
(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, an Executive Vice President or a Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, and this Agreement and that to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation:
(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) Since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries has sustained any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, and there has been no material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(f) At the time this Agreement is executed and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP, as independent accountants for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated such date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex I.
(g) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, there shall not have occurred (i) any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus or (ii) any material change or decrease in those items specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (g) of this Section 5 the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
 
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.

("Moody's") affirms a previous announcement that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications or outlook, its rating of the Company's senior debt securities and that, in such announcement, Moody's does not downgrade its ratings of the Company's senior debt securities, such announcement shall not be considered an announcement for purposes of subsection (ii) that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications or outlook, its rating of the Company's senior debt securities.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date, by the Underwriters.

6. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by it in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, any other free writing prospectus (including, without limitation, any electronic road show) or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to any Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to any Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified
 
party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so as to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), approved by the Underwriters in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The indemnifying party shall have the right to, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party so long as such settlement (i) is limited to the payment of monetary damages only, (ii) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such proceeding and (iii) does not (x) include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party or (y) otherwise give rise to additional liabilities on the part of the indemnified party.
provided
however
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
 
thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), each Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which each Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters for Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.

Default by an Underwriter
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the non-defaulting Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the non-defaulting Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than five days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the counsel for the Underwriters may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b)
 
above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 6 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities on the Closing Date, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock or any preferred stock or preferred securities shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the Exchange or trading in securities generally on the Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in markets in the United States or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities on the Closing Date, as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. . The respective agreement, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Filed pursuant to Rule 433
Registration number 333-157822
June 15, 2009
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PHILADELPHIA, June 15, 2009  Lincoln Financial Group (NYSE:LNC) today announced a registered public underwritten offering of $600 million of its common shares. The underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15 percent of the offered amount of common shares from the company. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. will serve as Global Coordinators and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will serve as joint book-running managers for the offering.
The common stock offering is a part of Lincoln's broader capital plan that also includes raising up to $500 million in senior debt and targeting approximately $950 million in preferred stock. Any preferred stock would be issued pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program (CPP).
Lincoln currently intends to contribute approximately $1 billion of the proceeds to its principal insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, with the remaining $1 billion held at the holding company for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term debt and investment in the company's core businesses.

Lincoln National Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Indiana (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to                                         , or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                          ($            ) on July 1, 2019 and to pay interest thereon from June 22, 2009 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided

Payment of the principal of, and interest on, this Note will be made at the designated office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in The City of New York, New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debt or, at the option of the Company, interest so payable may be paid by check to the order of said Holder mailed to his address appearing on the Security Register.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lincoln National Corporation has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
Dated: June 22, 2009
Dated: June 22, 2009
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company of a series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of March 10, 2009 (hereinafter the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (hereinafter the "Trustee", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holder of the Securities and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which different series may vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Securities of the Company designated as its 8.75% Senior Note due 2019 (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to $            , except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Notes of this series are issuable in registered form only in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
All terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time, upon mailed notice to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. The redemption price will be the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the make-whole amount, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. "Make-whole amount" means the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Notes, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points.
"Comparable treasury issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by a reference treasury dealer as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes called for redemption, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities with a term comparable to such period.
"Comparable treasury price" means, with respect to a redemption date, (1) the average of five reference treasury dealer quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest reference treasury dealer quotations, or (2) if the quotation agent obtains fewer than five such reference treasury dealer quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Quotation agent" means the entity appointed by the Company, which in any case shall not be the Trustee, to determine the make-whole amount.
"Reference treasury dealer" means (1) Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and (2) any additional primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "primary treasury dealer") selected by the Company and their successors, provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a primary treasury dealer the Company will substitute another primary treasury dealer.
"Reference treasury dealer quotations" means, with respect to each reference treasury dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the quotation agent, of the bid and ask prices for the comparable treasury issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the quotation agent at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Remaining scheduled payments" means the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes called for redemption that would be due after the related redemption date but for that redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to the Notes called for redemption, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on such Notes will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such redemption date.
"Treasury rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the comparable treasury issue, assuming a price for the comparable treasury issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the comparable treasury price for that redemption date.
The Company will prepare and mail a notice of redemption to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. On and after a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before a redemption date, the Company will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro rata or by lot or by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund. If an Event of Default shall occur with respect to the Notes, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the Notes, upon which the Company, at its option, shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes or shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected by such amendment or supplement voting as one class. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency. Subject to certain exceptions, any past default or Event of Default may be waived by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series affected on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of that series or the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Outstanding Securities voting as one class. After the amendment or supplement is effective, any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange hereunder or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or upon any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for transfer at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York, New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for the
 
purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, this Note or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in any manner in respect hereof, or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or, except as provided in the Indenture, successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitutional provision or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or in any other manner, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
