Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives (the "Representatives") for the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase an additional 6,000,000 shares of our Common Stock (the "Option Securities"). On June 22, 2009, the Representatives exercised in full their option to purchase the Option Securities. We completed the issuance and sale of the Option Securities on June 25, 2009 at the same per share price to the public ($15.00) and the same per share price to the Underwriters ($14.34) as the Firm Securities.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
