Item 7.01.                      Regulation FD Disclosure
We will participate in the J.P. Morgan Insurance Conference on Monday, March 22, 2010, at approximately 1:00 p.m. (EDT).   Frederick J. Crawford, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will discuss our businesses, results of operations and capital position.  A copy of Mr. Crawfords slides to be used in connection with his presentation at the Conference are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.   Mr. Crawfords slides are also available on our website at www.lincolnfinancial.com/investor.
Interested persons are invited to listen to Mr. Crawfords presentation at the J.P. Morgan Insurance Conference.  You can access the Conference live by calling 800-857-2850 (toll free)

Certain statements made by Mr. Crawford during the presentation may be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA").  A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.  In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results, and the outcome of contingencies , such as legal proceedings.  We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among others:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this Form 8-K.
