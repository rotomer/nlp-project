Item 2.04.  Triggering Events that Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
On November 15, 2010, Lincoln National Corporation (the Company) called for redemption on December 15, 2010 of all of its outstanding 6.75% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, Series F due 2052 (the Junior Subordinated Debentures), which are held by Lincoln National Capital VI.  As a result, all of the outstanding 6.75% Trust Preferred Securities, Series F and 6.75% Common Securities of Lincoln National Capital VI will be redeemed on December 15, 2010.  The redemption price for the Trust Preferred Securities, Series F will be $25.00 per security, for a total principal amount of $150,000,000, plus any accrued distributions up to the redemption date.
The aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to be redeemed is $154,640,000, plus accrued interest thereon up to the redemption date.  The Junior Subordinated Debentures were originally issued on September 11, 2003, and in accordance with their terms, are subject to optional redemption by the Company on or after September 11, 2008.  Pursuant to the terms of its Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, Lincoln National Capital VI is required to use the proceeds it receives from the redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debentures to redeem its Trust Preferred Securities, Series F and 6.75% Common Securities on the same day.
As a result of these transactions, the Company will incur a non-cash charge of approximately $3.1 million, net of taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The non-cash charge reflects the acceleration of the unamortized issuance costs.
For additional information, see the press release announcing the redemption attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto.
Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
The response to Item 2.02 is hereby incorporated by reference in answer to this Item 7.01.
Certain statements made in this report, and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA).  A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like:  believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will, shall and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.  In particular, these include statements r elating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.

Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance.

Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.
