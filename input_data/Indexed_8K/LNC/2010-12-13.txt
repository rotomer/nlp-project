On December 3, 2010, David A. Stonecipher, a member of our Board, adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 (the "December Trading Plan") of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The December Trading Plan provides for the sale of common stock of the Company, at prices ranging from $33 to $36 per share, beginning on March 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2011, unless the plan is terminated prior to that date. The number of shares that may be sold under the December Trading Plan is limited to the number of shares that have not been sold at the expiration of Mr. Stonecipher's existing and previously disclosed Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Both trading plans provide for the shares to be sold on the same terms and conditions.
