                         NEWS RELEASE
 
Philadelphia, PA, November 2, 2011
 Lincoln Financial Group (NYSE:LNC) today reported net income for the third quarter of 2011 of $143 million, or $0.44 per diluted share available to common stockholders, compared to net income in the third quarter of 2010 of $246 million, or $0.75 per diluted share available to common stockholders.
 
Third quarter income from operations was $317 million, or $1.00 per diluted share available to common stockholders, compared to $206 million, or $0.63 per diluted share available to common stockholders in the third quarter of 2010. 
The quarter included a variety of notable items that largely offset each other.
 
Our operating results were very strong while volatile markets negatively impacted net income, said President & CEO Dennis R. Glass. Investments in our Group Protection and Defined Contribution businesses supported higher sales, improving loss ratios and positive net flows. We focused on driving top line growth, taking pricing actions to increase returns, enhancing risk management and returning capital to shareholders.

Third Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
Third Quarter 2011  Segment Results
Retirement Solutions
Individual Annuities
The Individual Annuities segment reported income from operations of $162 million in the third quarter of 2011, versus income from operations of $126 million in the year-ago period.
Total annuity deposits of $2.7 billion were down 9% from the prior year quarter due to a drop in fixed annuity deposits, while variable annuity deposits of $2.2 billion were up 7%.  Total net flows in the current quarter were $0.7 billion. Lincolns stable results reflect a consistent market presence and comprehensive risk management.
The quarter included $30 million of net positive items attributable primarily to favorable tax true-up and net positive DAC adjustments.
Defined Contribution
Defined Contribution reported income from operations of $41 million, versus income from operations of $50 million for the same period a year ago, which included an $11 million benefit associated with DAC unlocking and adjustments resulting from model reviews.
Gross deposits of $1.5 billion were up 15% versus the prior-year quarter driven by first-year sales in the mid-to-large case market. Total net flows in the current quarter were $329 million as compared to $(278) million in the 2010 quarter. Investments in distribution and a new administrative platform are driving improved results.

The current quarter included a net positive of $3 million primarily attributable to positive DAC adjustments.
Insurance Solutions
Life Insurance
Life Insurance income from operations was $132 million compared to $60 million in the third quarter of 2010, which included net negative items of $92 million mainly associated with the annual review of assumptions and models underlying life insurance-related assets and liabilities.
Life insurance sales of $155 million increased 4% over the prior-year quarter. Life insurance in force of $574 billion grew 3% and account values of $34 billion increased 5% over the prior-year quarter. The company continued to take product pricing actions in the quarter in response to lower interest rates.
The quarter included $19 million of net negative items attributable primarily to unfavorable mortality and negative unlocking adjustments.
Group Protection
Group Protections income from operations was $28 million, compared to $9.5 million in the prior-year period. The non-medical loss ratio of 72% in the current quarter declined from 79% in the third quarter of 2010.
Group Protection sales of $75 million for the quarter increased 9% from the same period last year. Non-medical net earned premiums were $410 million in the third quarter, up 7% over the year-ago period. Price increases and the addition of resources to claims management over the past several quarters contributed to Group Protections strong performance in the period.
Other Operations
The operating loss in Other Operations was $44 million in the quarter versus a loss of $40 million in the prior-year quarter. The quarters results included $12 million of net negative items primarily attributable to guaranty association assessments related to the insolvency of Executive Life of New York.

Realized Gains and Losses
Realized gains/losses (after-tax) in the quarter included:
Unrealized Gains and Losses
The company reported a net unrealized gain of approximately $6.2 billion, pre-tax, on its available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2011.  This compares to a net unrealized gain of approximately $5.0 billion at September 30, 2010.
Annual Review of Assumptions
The companys annual comprehensive review of actuarial assumptions resulted in a charge of $79 million, or $0.25 per share to net income, of which a charge of $27 million, or $0.09 per share is included in income from operations.
Implementation of New Accounting Guidance
The company will adopt ASU No. 2010-26, Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts, effective January 1, 2012. We estimate that retrospective adoption will result in a cumulative effect adjustment to equity of approximately $950 million to $1.15 billion.  Income from operations would have declined by approximately 5% to 7% for the first nine months of 2011 had we applied the guidance during 2011.
Stock Repurchase
During the quarter the company repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock at a cost of $150 million.
Book Value
As of September 30, 2011, book value per share of common stock, including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), increased 16% to $49.43 from a year ago. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $41.27 up 10% from $37.54 a year ago.

Definition of Income (Loss) from Operations and Return on Equity
Income (loss) from operations and return on equity, as used in the earnings release, are non-GAAP financial measures and are not substitutes for net income (loss) and ROE, calculated using GAAP measures.  We exclude the after-tax effects of the following items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at income (loss) from operations: realized gains and losses associated with the following ("excluded realized gain (loss)"): sale or disposal of securities; impairments of securities; change in the fair value of derivative investments; embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of our trading securities; change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit ("GDB") riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as "GDB derivatives results"; change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (embedded derivative reserves), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as GLB net derivative results; and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (indexed annuity forward-starting option); change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders ("benefit ratio unlocking"); income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards; income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance; gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt; losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and income (loss) from discontinued operations.
TM
Return on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets.  Return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) by average equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI").  Management evaluates return on equity by both including and excluding average goodwill within average equity.
The earnings used to calculate ROE, as used in the earnings release, are net income (loss) and income (loss) from operations.  Income (loss) from operations is an internal measure used by the company in the management of its operations.  Management believes that this performance measure explains the results of the company's ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's current business because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in most instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.
The company uses its prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in its financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Definition of Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI
Book value per share excluding AOCI is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding, assuming conversion of Series A preferred shares. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations.  Management believes book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per share to book value per share excluding AOCI as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below.

Forward Looking Statements  Cautionary Language
 
 
Certain statements made in this press release and in other written or oral statements made by Lincoln or on Lincoln's behalf are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in Lincoln's businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Lincoln claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.
 
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among others:
 
 
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
 
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this release.
