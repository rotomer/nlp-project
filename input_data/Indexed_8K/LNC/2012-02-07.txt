                         NEWS RELEASE
 
 Lincoln Financial Group (NYSE:LNC) today reported a fourth quarter net loss of $514 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to net income of $196 million, or $0.60 per diluted share available to common stockholders, in 2010. The company also reported fourth quarter 2011 income from operations of $303 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $266 million, or $0.82 per diluted share available to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2010. The primary difference between net income and income from operations resulted from a $747 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the life insurance and media businesses.
Philadelphia, PA, February 7, 2012
Net income for the full year of 2011 was $290 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $812 million, or $2.54 per diluted share available to common stockholders, in 2010. For the full year 2011, income from operations was $1.3 billion, or $4.17 per diluted share, compared to $1.0 billion, or $3.13 per diluted share available to common stockholders, for the full year of 2010.
 Lincolns 2011 operating results reflect continued strength in flows and deposits across our businesses, ongoing product repricing to achieve targeted returns, and significant capital management activities, said President & CEO Dennis R. Glass.  We continue to give priority to relative returns in our capital allocation and business decisions, balancing reinvestment in our core businesses with the opportunity to create value through increased share repurchases.

Fourth Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
:
Full Year 2011 Operating Highlights
 
The quarter included several notable items that in the aggregate offset each other.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011  Segment Results
Individual Annuities
The Individual Annuities segment reported income from operations of $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $123 million in the year-ago period.
Sales and flows for the year and quarter continued to reflect the companys consistent market presence through a multi-channel, multi-product strategy and a focus on disciplined product design.
Gross annuity deposits in the fourth quarter of $2.4 billion were down 8% from the prior-year quarter with low interest rates reducing demand for fixed annuities.  Net annuity flows of $345 million were down 37% on lower deposits.
For the full year, gross annuity deposits of $10.7 billion included $8.7 billion of variable annuity deposits that were up 6% over the prior-year. Annuity net flows were $2.2 billion, almost entirely attributable to variable annuities.

Retirement Plan Services (Formerly Defined Contribution)
Retirement Plan Services reported income from operations of $35 million compared to $33 million in the year-ago period.
Gross deposits of $1.6 billion were up 16% versus the prior-year quarter driven by strong first-year and renewal deposits in the mid-to-large case market as investments in technology and distribution gained traction. Total net flows in the current quarter were $219 million as compared to $(304) million in the 2010 quarter. For the full year, gross deposits were $5.6 billion up 5% driving net flows of $504 million.
Life Insurance
Life Insurance income from operations was $154 million compared to $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to lower than expected net investment income related to alternative investment and prepayment income.
Life insurance sales of $229 million increased 11% over the prior-year quarter and sales for the full year of $700 million increased 10% compared to 2010.  Both periods results reflect a decline in secondary guarantee universal life sales as we adjusted pricing to deemphasize single premium policies and shifted our focus to other products.
Life insurance in force of $580 billion grew 3% and account values of $35 billion increased 5% over the prior-year quarter.
The quarter included net positive items of $4 million primarily attributable to favorable DAC adjustments. The prior-year quarter included net positive items of approximately $10 million, after tax.
 
Group Protection
Group Protections income from operations was $22 million, compared to $18 million in the prior-year period. The non-medical loss ratio of 72.2% in the current quarter declined from 75.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Improvements to claims management processes and disciplined pricing actions have contributed to the favorable reduction in the non-medical loss ratio.
Group Protection sales of $207 million for the quarter increased 33% from the same period last year. Non-medical net earned premiums were $412 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% over the year-ago period. For the full year, non-medical net earned premiums were $1.6 billion versus $1.5 billion in 2010, and annualized sales of $395 million increased 12% from $353 million.

Other Operations
The operating loss in Other Operations was $42 million in the quarter versus a loss of $74 million in the prior-year quarter. The quarters results included net negative items of $7 million primarily attributable to the true-up of guaranty association assessments related to the insolvency of Executive Life of New York. The 2010 quarter included net negative items of approximately $41 million, after tax, primarily related to legal expenses.
Realized Gains and Losses
Realized gains/losses (after-tax) in the quarter included:
Unrealized Gains and Losses
The company reported a net unrealized gain of approximately $6.5 billion, pre-tax, on its available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2011.  This compares to a net unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010.
Annual Review of Goodwill
The companys annual review of each businesss goodwill asset resulted in a non-cash, after-tax charge of $747 million, or $2.51 per share, to net income.
 
Based on life insurance market dynamics and lower expected sales associated with product pricing changes, we recorded a $650 million impairment of life insurance goodwill.  A $97 million impairment of the remaining Media goodwill asset reflects the challenging operating environment and outlook for the business, which drove the reduction in the valuation of the media properties.

Capital
During the quarter, the company completed a series of capital-related transactions:
 
Book Value
As of December 31, 2011, book value per share of common stock, including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), increased 20% to $48.59 from a year ago. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $40.19 up 5% from $38.17 a year ago.
This press release may contain statements that are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially, especially given the current economic and capital markets conditions. Please see the Forward Looking Statements  Cautionary Language that follow for additional factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
The tables attached to this release define and reconcile income from operations, return on equity (ROE), and book value per share excluding AOCI, non-GAAP measures, to net income, ROE, and book value per share including AOCI calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Definition of Income (Loss) from Operations, Operating Revenues and Return on Equity
Income (loss) from operations, operating revenues and return on equity (ROE), as used in the earnings release, are non-GAAP financial measures and do not replace GAAP revenues,  net income (loss) and ROE.  We exclude the after-tax effects of the following items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at income (loss) from operations: realized gains and losses associated with the following ("excluded realized gain (loss)"): sale or disposal of securities; impairments of securities; change in the fair value of derivative investments; embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities; change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit ("GDB") riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as "GDB derivatives results"; change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (embedded derivative reserves), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as GLB net derivative results; and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (indexed annuity forward-starting option); change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders ("benefit ratio unlocking"); income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards; income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance; gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt; losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and income (loss) from discontinued operations.
TM
Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable: excluded realized gain (loss); amortization of deferred front-end loads (DFEL) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking; amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.
Return on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets.  Return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) by average equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI").  Management evaluates return on equity by both including and excluding average goodwill within average equity.
The earnings used to calculate ROE, as used in the earnings release, are net income (loss) and income (loss) from operations.  Income (loss) from operations is an internal measure used by the company in the management of its operations.  Management believes that this performance measure explains the results of the company's ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's current business because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in most instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.
The company uses its prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in its financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Definition of Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI
Book value per share excluding AOCI is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding, assuming conversion of Series A preferred shares. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations.  Management believes book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per share to book value per share excluding AOCI as of December 30, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below.

Forward Looking Statements  Cautionary Language
 
Certain statements made in this press release and in other written or oral statements made by Lincoln or on Lincoln's behalf are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in Lincoln's businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Lincoln claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.
 
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among others:
 
 
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
 
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this press release.
