First quarter income from operations was $296 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $322 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011.
Our strong first quarter operating results continue to reflect the actions we have taken to grow our top line and protect margins across our businesses. said Dennis R.

Sales increases in Retirement Plan Services and Group Protection are the direct result of strategic investments we have made in these areas, while strong capital generation drove higher share repurchases.

First Quarter 2012 Highlights
The current quarter included no items of note while the prior year quarter included $34 million (as adjusted for ASU 2010-26) of net positive notable items.
First Quarter 2012  Segment Results
Annuities
The Annuities segment reported income from operations of $137 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $144 million in the year-ago period which included $18 million of net positive notable items.
Variable annuity deposits of $2.2 billion were flat with the prior year quarter and up 8% from the fourth quarter driven by strong equity market performance and consistent with industry growth.  Variable annuity net flows of $0.5 billion were in line with the prior year quarter.
Fixed annuity deposits of $295 million were down 35% from the first quarter of last year as low interest rates continued to dampen demand.  Fixed annuity net outflows were $170 million compared to net inflows of $31 million in the prior year quarter.
Account values ended the quarter at a record $92 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter and up 7% from the fourth quarter.
Retirement Plan Services
Retirement Plan Services reported income from operations of $35 million compared to $48 million in the year-ago period, which included $9 million of net positive notable items.

Our investments in technology and distribution continue to advance business results. Gross deposits of $1.5 billion were up 13% versus the prior-year quarter and benefitted from a 74% increase in small case sales.  These strong deposits, along with improved retention and market growth, drove quarter end account balances to a record high $42 billion.  Total net flows in the current quarter were $212 million, up 58% as compared to the 2011 quarter.
Life Insurance
Life Insurance income from operations was $142 million compared to $142 million in the first quarter of 2011 which included $2 million of net positive notable items.
Life insurance sales of $122 million decreased 24% over the prior-year quarter reflecting a decline in secondary guarantee universal life sales in response to pricing actions.  The companys strategy to direct sales to higher return products, including indexed universal life, variable universal life and term insurance, was successful as the aggregate sales of these products increased 11% over the prior year quarter.
Life insurance in force of $580 billion grew 2% and account values of $36 billion increased 5% over the prior-year quarter.
Group Protection
For the first quarter, Group Protection income from operations was $16 million, compared to $24 million in the prior-year period, which included $5 million of notable items.  The non-medical loss ratio of 75% in the current quarter increased from 74% in the first quarter of 2011 due to a fluctuation in mortality, which led to higher than expected claims.
Group Protection sales of $67 million for the quarter increased 47% from lower than expected sales in the prior year quarter.  Non-medical net earned premiums were $431 million in the first quarter, up 7% over the year-ago period on strong sales.
Other Operations
The operating loss in Other Operations was $34 million in the quarter versus a loss of $37 million in the prior-year quarter.

Definition of Income (Loss) from Operations, Operating Revenues and Return on Equity
Income (loss) from operations, operating revenues and return on equity (ROE), as used in the earnings release, are non-GAAP financial measures and do not replace GAAP revenues,  net income (loss) and ROE.  We exclude the after-tax effects of the following items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at income (loss) from operations: realized gains and losses associated with the following (excluded realized gain (loss)): sale or disposal of securities; impairments of securities; change in the fair value of derivative investments, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities; change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (GDB) riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as "GDB derivatives results"; change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (embedded derivative reserves), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as GLB net derivative results; and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (indexed annuity forward-starting option); change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (benefit ratio unlocking); income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards; income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance; gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt; losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and income (loss) from discontinued operations.
 
Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable: excluded realized gain (loss); amortization of deferred front-end loads (DFEL) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking; amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.
 
Return on equity measures how efficiently we generate profits from the resources provided by our net assets.  Return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) by average equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).  Management evaluates return on equity by both including and excluding average goodwill within average equity.
 
Income (loss) from operations, operating revenues, return on equity (including and excluding average goodwill within average equity), excluding AOCI, using annualized income (loss) from operations and return on capital are financial measures we use to evaluate and assess our results.  Management believes that these performance measures explain the results of the company's ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's current business because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in most instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.
 
The company uses its prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in its financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Definition of Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI
Book value per share excluding AOCI is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by (b) common shares outstanding, assuming conversion of Series A preferred shares. We provide book value per share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations.  Management believes book value per share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per share to book value per share excluding AOCI as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 is set forth below.

Forward Looking Statements  Cautionary Language
 
 
Certain statements made in this press release and in other written or oral statements made by Lincoln or on Lincoln's behalf are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in Lincoln's businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Lincoln claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.
 
 
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements include, among others:
 
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors which could impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this press release.
