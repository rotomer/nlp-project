2. Entry into Change in Control Severance Agreements
The Company entered into Severance Agreements (the "Severance Agreements") effective as of July 9, 2008 with each of Martin L. Orlowsky, Randy B. Spell, Charles E. Hennighausen, Ronald S. Milstein, Thomas R. Staab and David H. Taylor, each of whom is named executive officer of the Company. A copy of the form of Severance Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The initial term of the Severance Agreements expires on December 31, 2010, but is automatically renewed for successive calendar years commencing on January 1, 2010 unless notice of nonrenewal has been provided by either party to the Severance Agreement. The Severance Agreements are automatically extended for twenty-four months following a Change in Control.
A Change in Control is deemed to occur if: (i) any person becomes the owner of 30% or more of the Company's voting securities; (ii) the majority of the membership of the Board changes without approval of two-thirds of the directors who either were directors on the date of the related Severance Agreement, or whose election was previously so approved; (iii) there is a merger or consolidation with another company following which the members of the Board
do not constitute a majority of the members of the board of the surviving entity; or (iv) there is a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation.
Benefits are payable under the Severance Agreements only upon termination of the executive's employment by the Company other than for cause or by the executive for Good Reason within two years following (or in connection with) a Change in Control. "Good Reason" includes the assignment of duties inconsistent with the executive's status or a substantial adverse alteration in the nature or status of the executive's responsibilities, relocation of the principal place of employment to a location that increases the one-way commute by more than 25 miles, reduction in base salary or failure to continue comparable compensation and benefit plans.
The Severance Agreements provide for the following benefits upon termination of the executive's employment in a manner entitling the Executive to benefits:
 
The Company also entered into substantially similar severance agreements with 35 additional key employees except that these agreements (i) provide cash benefits at different multiples of total compensation, (ii) provide continuing benefits over a shorter period of time and (iii) in most cases, do not provide for a gross-up payment for excess parachute payments.
 
On July 9, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to $400 million of its outstanding common stock. A copy of the press release, dated July 9, 2008, is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

Severance Payments
6.1 Subject to Section 6.2 hereof, if the Executive's employment is terminated following a Change in Control and during the Term, other than (A) by the Company for Cause, (B) by reason of death or Disability, or (C) by the Executive without Good Reason, then the Company shall pay the Executive the amounts, and
 
provide the Executive the benefits, described in this Section 6.1 ("Severance Payments") and Section 6.2, in addition to any payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled under Section 5 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the Executive with Good Reason, if (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs) and such termination was at the request or direction of a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control, (ii) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason prior to a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs) and the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason occurs at the request or direction of such Person, or (iii) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason and such termination or the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason is otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control (whether or not a Change in Control ever occurs).
(A) In lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to the Executive, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum severance payment, in cash, equal to three (3) times the sum of (i) the Executive's base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (ii) the Executive's target annual bonus under any annual bonus or incentive plan maintained by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which occurs the Date of Termination or, if higher, the fiscal year in which occurs the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason.
(B) For the thirty-six (36) month period immediately following the Date of Termination, the Company shall arrange to provide the
 
Executive and his dependents life, accident and health insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided to the Executive and his dependents immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, at no greater after-tax cost to the Executive than the after-tax cost to the Executive immediately prior to such date or occurrence; , , that, unless the Executive consents to a different method, such health insurance benefits shall be provided through a third-party insurer. Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6.1(B) shall be reduced to the extent benefits of the same type are received by or made available to the Executive during the thirty-six (36) month period following the Executive's termination of employment (and any such benefits received by or made available to the Executive shall be reported to the Company by the Executive); , , that the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the excess, if any, of the after-tax cost of such benefits to the Executive over such cost immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. If the Severance Payments shall be decreased pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, and the Section 6.1(B) benefits which remain payable after the application of Section 6.2 hereof are thereafter reduced pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall, no later than five (5) business days following such reduction, pay to the Executive the least of (a) the amount of the decrease made in the Severance Payments pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, (b) the amount of the subsequent reduction in these Section 6.1(B) benefits, or (c) the maximum amount which can be paid to the Executive without being, or causing any other payment to be, nondeductible by reason of section 280G of the Code.

(C) Notwithstanding any provision of any annual incentive plan to the contrary, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) any unpaid incentive compensation which has been
 
allocated or awarded to the Executive for a completed fiscal year preceding the Date of Termination under any such plan and which, as of the Date of Termination, is contingent only upon the continued employment of the Executive to a subsequent date, and (ii) a pro rata portion to the Date of Termination of the annual incentive bonus the Executive would have received for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, calculated by multiplying the award that the Executive would have earned on the last day of such year, assuming achievement at the target level of the individual and corporate performance goals established with respect to such award, by the fraction obtained by dividing the number of full months and any fractional portion of a month during such year through the Date of Termination by twelve (12).
(D) In addition to the retirement benefits to which the Executive is entitled under each DB Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the excess of (i) the actuarial equivalent of the aggregate retirement pension (taking into account any early retirement subsidies associated therewith and determined as a straight life annuity commencing at the date (but in no event earlier than the third anniversary of the Date of Termination) as of which the actuarial equivalent of such annuity is greatest) which the Executive would have accrued under the terms of all DB Pension Plans (without regard to any amendment to any DB Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the computation of retirement benefits thereunder), determined as if the Executive were fully vested thereunder and had accumulated (after the Date of Termination) thirty-six (36) additional months of service credit thereunder and had been credited under each DB Pension Plan during such period with compensation equal to the Executive's compensation (as defined in such DB Pension Plan) during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding Date of Termination or, if higher, during the twelve months immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, over (ii) the actuarial equivalent of the aggregate
 
retirement pension (taking into account any early retirement subsidies associated therewith and determined as a straight life annuity commencing at the date (but in no event earlier than the Date of Termination) as of which the actuarial equivalent of such annuity is greatest) which the Executive had accrued pursuant to the provisions of the DB Pension Plans as of the Date of Termination. For purposes of this Section 6.1(D), "actuarial equivalent" shall be determined using the same assumptions utilized under the Retirement Plan for Employees of Lorillard Tobacco Company immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. In addition to the benefits to which the Executive is entitled under each DC Pension Plan, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) the amount that would have been contributed thereto by the Company on the Executive's behalf during the three years immediately following the Date of Termination, determined (x) as if the Executive made the maximum permissible contributions thereto during such period, (y) as if the Executive earned compensation during such period at a rate equal to the Executive's compensation (as defined in the DC Pension Plan) during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Date of Termination or, if higher, during the twelve months immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting Good Reason, and (z) without regard to any amendment to the DC Pension Plan made subsequent to a Change in Control, which amendment adversely affects in any manner the computation of benefits thereunder, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Executive's account balance under the DC Pension Plan as of the Date of Termination over (y) the portion of such account balance that is nonforfeitable under the terms of the DC Pension Plan.
(E) If the Executive would have become entitled to benefits under the Company's post-retirement health care or life insurance plans, as in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or
 
circumstance constituting Good Reason, had the Executive's employment terminated at any time during the period of thirty-six (36) months after the Date of Termination, the Company shall provide such post-retirement health care or life insurance benefits to the Executive and the Executive's dependents commencing on the later of (i) the date on which such coverage would have first become available and (ii) the date on which benefits described in subsection (B) of this Section 6.1 terminate.
(F) The Company shall provide the Executive with $25,000 of outplacement services suitable to the Executive's position for a period of one year immediately following the Date of Termination or, if earlier, until the first acceptance by the Executive of an offer of employment.
6.2 (A) Whether or not the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments, if any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive's employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) (all such payments and benefits, including the Severance Payments, being hereinafter called "Total Payments") will be subject (in whole or part) to the Excise Tax, then, subject to the provisions of subsection (B) of this Section 6.2, the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any federal, state and local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the Total Payments.
(B) In the event that the amount of the Total Payments does not exceed 110% of the largest amount that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the "Safe Harbor"), then subsection (A) of this Section 6.2 shall not apply and the cash Severance Payments shall first be reduced, if necessary, to zero (with amounts not subject to Section 409A of the Code
 
being reduced prior to amounts that are subject to Section 409A of the Code), and all other Severance Payments shall thereafter be reduced, if necessary, to zero (with amounts not subject to Section 409A of the Code being reduced prior to amounts that are subject to Section 409A of the Code), so that the amount of the Total Payments is equal to the Safe Harbor; , , that, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Executive may elect to have the non-cash Severance Payments reduced (or eliminated) prior to any reduction of the cash Severance Payments. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent the Executive is terminated (i) following a Change in Control but prior to a change in ownership or control of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or (ii) prior to a Change in Control in a manner described in Section 6.1, to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts payable to the Executive hereunder, to the extent not in excess of the amount that the Executive would have received under any other pre-Change in Control severance plan or arrangement with the Company had such plan or arrangement been applicable, shall be paid at the time and in the manner provided by such plan or arrangement and the remainder shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3.

(C) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, unless in the opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company's independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(l) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or
 
in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. Prior to the payment date set forth in Section 6.3 hereof, the Company shall provide the Executive with its calculation of the amounts referred to in this Section 6.2(C) and such supporting materials as are reasonably necessary for the Executive to evaluate the Company's calculations. If the Executive disputes the Company's calculations (in whole or in part), the reasonable opinion of Tax Counsel with respect to the matter in dispute shall prevail.
(I) In the event that (1) amounts are paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 6.2(A), (2) there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax is less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, and (3) after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments are to be reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B), the Executive shall repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the Gross-Up Payment, the amount of the reduction in the Severance Payments, plus interest on the amount of such repayments at 120% of the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
(II) In the event that (1) amounts are paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 6.2(A), (2) there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax is less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Gross-Up Payment, and (3) after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments are not to be reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B), the Executive shall repay to the Company, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the
 
Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income and employment taxes imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive), to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for purposes of federal, state and local income and employment taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
(III) Except as otherwise provided in clause (IV) below, in the event there is a Final Determination that the Excise Tax exceeds the amount taken into account hereunder in determining the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall pay to the Executive, within five (5) business days following the date of the Final Determination, the sum of (1) a Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess and in respect of any portion of the Excise Tax with respect to which the Company had not previously made a Gross-Up Payment, including a Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Excise Tax attributable to amounts payable under clauses (2) and (3) of this paragraph (III) (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess and such portion), (2) if Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) but after giving effect to such Final Determination, the Severance Payments should not have been reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B), the amount by which the Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B), and (3) interest on such amounts at 120% of the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
(IV) In the event that (1) Severance Payments were reduced pursuant to Section 6.2(B) and (2) the aggregate value of Total Payments which are considered "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code is subsequently redetermined in a Final
 
Determination, but such redetermined value still does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor, then, within five (5) business days following such Final Determination, (x) the Company shall pay to the Executive the amount (if any) by which the reduced Severance Payments (after taking the Final Determination into account) exceeds the amount of the reduced Severance Payments actually paid to the Executive, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code, or (y) the Executive shall pay to the Company the amount (if any) by which the reduced Severance Payments actually paid to the Executive exceeds the amount of the reduced Severance Payments (after taking the Final Determination into account), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 120% of the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
6.3 The payments provided in subsections (A), (C) and (D) of Section 6.1 hereof and in Section 6.2 hereof, shall be made not later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination; , , that if the amounts of such payments, and the limitation on such payments set forth in Section 6.2 hereof, cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Executive, or, in the case of payments under Section 6.2 hereof, in accordance with Section 6.2 hereof, of the minimum amount of such payments to which the Executive is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest on the unpaid remainder (or on all such payments to the extent the Company fails to make such payments when due) at 120% of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined but in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the Date of Termination; and , , that the payment provided in Section 6.2 hereof shall be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related excise tax is paid.

At the time that payments are made under this Agreement, the Company shall provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).

No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of any lack of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement supersedes any other agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof which have been made by either party, including but not limited to the Lorillard Tobacco Company Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan"); , , that this Agreement shall supersede any agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the Executive's employment with the Company, and the Executive Severance Plan, in each case only in the event that the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated on, following, or in connection with a Change in Control, by the Company other than for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina.

11.2 . The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A") and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of this Agreement and no payments shall be due to Executive under this Agreement providing for payment of amounts on termination of employment unless Executive would be considered to have incurred a "separation from service" from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A and any payments described in this Agreement that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. All reimbursements shall be paid within five (5) business days after delivery of Executive's written request for payment accompanied by evidence of the fees and expenses incurred, as the Company may reasonably require, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses are incurred. To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following Executive's termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following Executive's termination of employment (or upon Executive's death, if earlier), together with interest calculated from the fifth (5
Section 409A
th
) day following termination of employment until the date of payment, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from time to time, compounded annually.
