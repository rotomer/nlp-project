Second Quarter 2008 Results
Net sales were $1.070 billion in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $1.056 billion in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume after adjusting for the impact of additional units shipped in 2007 as part of a free product promotion, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. Gross profit was essentially unchanged as the increase in net sales was offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the second quarter of 2008 of 9.667 billion units was down 0.2 of a percent compared with the second quarter of 2007. Domestic wholesale shipments were down 0.1 of a percent for the same period. Total industry shipments are estimated to be down 3.2% for the second quarter of 2008 compared with the second quarter of 2007. See attached table for details of Lorillard brand wholesale shipments.
Newport's domestic wholesale shipments declined 1.5% in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, largely as the result of a substantial quantity of promotional units shipped in the second quarter of 2007 with no corresponding activity in the second quarter of 2008.
According to Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment database, Newport continued to increase its retail market share during the second quarter of 2008 by .43 share points over the second quarter of 2007. See attached table for selected retail share data.
 
 
Administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2008 include $5 million of costs (for which there was no tax benefit), or $0.03 per share, related to the separation of Lorillard from Loews. In addition, legal expenses were $4 million higher ($2 million after tax), or $0.01 per share, in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases.
Other income declined $17 million ($10 million after tax), or $0.06 per share, due to lower yields on investments and a lower average invested asset balance. Income from limited partnerships, which is included in investment income, amounted to $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $8 million ($5 million after tax), or $0.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2007. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 39.2% in the second quarter of 2008 compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of 2007, which increased income taxes by $7 million or $0.04 per share, primarily due to the impact of separation on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses.
The company reported net income of $217 million, compared to $239 million in the second quarter of 2007. These results, as compared to the second quarter of 2007 reflect higher sales of $14 million, offset by higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements, expenses related to the separation from Loews, lower investment income and a higher effective tax rate. Net income per share for the second quarter of 2008 was $1.25, compared to $1.37 in the second quarter of 2007.
First Half 2008 Results
Net sales were $1.991 billion in the first half of 2008, compared to $1.969 billion in the first half of 2007. The increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume after adjusting for the impact of additional units shipped in 2007 as part of a free product promotion. During the first half of 2008, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by 0.1% versus an industry decline of 3.3%. Gross profit was essentially unchanged as the increase in net sales was offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements. See attached tables for wholesale shipment and selected retail share data comparing first six months of 2008 and 2007.
Administrative expenses in the first half of 2008 include $18 million of costs ($15 million after tax) related to the separation of Lorillard from Loews. In addition, there were $10 million ($6 million after tax) in higher legal expenses as compared to the first half of 2007.
Other income declined $40 million ($25 million after tax) due to lower yields and a lower average invested asset balance. Income from limited partnerships, which is included in investment income, amounted to $0.8 million in the first half of 2008 compared to $19 million ($12 million after tax) in the first half of 2007. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 38.2% in the first half of 2008 compared to 37.0% in the first half of 2007, which increased income taxes by $7 million, primarily due to the impact of separation on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses.
Net income for the first half of 2008 was $391 million, compared to $441 million in the first half of 2007. These results, as compared to 2007, reflect higher sales offset by higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements, increased selling, general and administrative expenses, costs related to the separation from Loews and lower investment income. Net income per share for the first half of 2008 was $2.25, compared to $2.53 for the first half of 2007.
