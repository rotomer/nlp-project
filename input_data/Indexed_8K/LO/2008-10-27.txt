Highlights
     
Third Quarter 2008 Results
     Net sales were $1.125 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $1.044 billion in the third quarter of 2007. The 7.8% increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. Gross profit was $472 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $430 million in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements.
     Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the third quarter of 2008 of 10.093 billion units was up 4.5 percent compared with the third quarter of 2007. Domestic wholesale shipments were up 4.5 percent for the same period. Total industry shipments are estimated to be down 3.4% for the third quarter of 2008 compared with the third quarter of 2007. See attached table for details of Lorillard brand wholesale shipments.
     Newport's domestic wholesale shipments increased 2.5% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007.
     According to Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment database, Newport continued to increase its retail market share during the third quarter of 2008 by .43 share points over the third quarter of 2007. See attached table for selected retail share data.
     Selling, general and administrative costs rose as a result of an increase in legal expenses of $9 million in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2007 due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases and other matters. Operating income was $382 million, or 34.0% of sales, compared to $348 million, or 33.3% of sales, in the same period a year ago.
 
     Other income declined $29 million ($0.10 per share after tax) during the third quarter of 2008, due to lower yields on investments and a lower average invested asset balance. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008. Investments in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2008 include $1.186 billion in repurchase agreements with financial institutions, which agreements are collateralized by treasury securities on deposit with the Company equal to 102% of the principal investment, $19 million in treasury money market funds and $2 million in other money market funds with various financial institutions.
     Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 38.5% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 36.0% in the third quarter of 2007, which increased income taxes by $10 million, primarily due to the impact of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the third quarter of 2007.
     The company reported net income of $237 million, compared to $244 million in the third quarter of 2007. These results, as compared to the third quarter of 2007 reflect higher net sales of $81 million, offset by higher expenses related to higher manufacturing costs, the State Settlement Agreements, higher legal expenses, lower investment income and a higher effective tax rate. Net income per share for the third quarter of 2008 was $1.38, compared to $1.40 in the third quarter of 2007.
     
First Nine Months 2008 Results
     Net sales were $3.116 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to $3.012 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The 3.5% increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. During the first nine months of 2008, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by 1.6% versus an industry decline of 3.3%. Gross profit was $1.282 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to $1.240 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements. See attached tables for wholesale shipment and selected retail share data comparing first nine months of 2008 and 2007.
     Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2008 include $18 million of costs related to the separation of Lorillard from Loews. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses rose as a result of an increase in legal expenses of $19 million as compared to the first nine months of 2007. Operating income was $1.001 billion, or 32.1% of sales, compared to $994 million, or 33.0% of sales, in the same period a year ago.
     Other income declined $68 million ($0.24 per share after tax) due to lower yields and a lower average invested asset balance. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships, which generated $31 million in investment income in the first nine months of 2007, were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008.
     Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 38.3% in the first nine months of 2008 compared to 36.7% in the first nine months of 2007, which increased income taxes by $17 million, primarily due to the impact of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses.
     Net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $629 million, compared to $684 million in the first nine months of 2007. These results, as compared to 2007, reflect higher sales offset by higher expenses related to higher manufacturing costs, the State Settlement Agreements, increased selling, general and administrative expenses, costs related to the separation from Loews and lower investment income. Net income per share for the first nine months of 2008 was $3.63, compared to $3.93 for the first nine months of 2007.
