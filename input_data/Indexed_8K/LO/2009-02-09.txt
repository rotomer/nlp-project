Highlights
Fourth Quarter 2008 Results
Net sales were $1.088 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $957 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 13.7% increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices, higher net unit sales volume and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. Gross profit was $494 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $422 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the fourth quarter of 2008 of 9.428 billion units increased 8.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments increased 8.3% for the same period. Total industry shipments decreased an estimated 3.3% for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. See attached table for details of Lorillard wholesale shipments.
Newport's domestic wholesale shipments increased 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its retail market share during the fourth quarter of 2008 by 0.32 share points from 9.54% in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 9.86% in the fourth quarter of 2008. See attached table for selected retail share data.
 
Selling, general and administrative costs decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to a $66 million litigation charge in the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease in costs was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases. Operating income was $414 million, or 38.1% of sales, compared to $280 million, or 29.3% of sales, in the same year ago period.
Other income declined $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, due to lower yields on investments and a lower average invested asset balance. Other income in the fourth quarter of 2008 includes losses from limited partnership investments totaling $0.5 million compared to income of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008. Investments in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008 include $953 million in treasury money market funds and $236 million in repurchase agreements with various financial institutions.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 29.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which increased income tax expense by $34 million. This was primarily due to the impact of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net income was $258 million, or $1.54 per share (basic) and $1.53 (diluted), compared to $213 million, or $1.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2008 than in the fourth quarter of 2007 resulting from the share repurchase program completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.05.
"We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008, which can be attributed to our strong operating performance and strides made growing our market share," stated Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lorillard. "Despite the obvious difficulties in the macroeconomic environment, Lorillard continues to reap the benefits of our core strategies and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to manage through an uncertain environment going forward."
2008 Results
Net sales were $4.204 billion in 2008, compared to $3.969 billion in 2007. The 5.9% increase in net sales reflects higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume and was partially offset by higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. During 2008, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by 3.2% versus an estimated industry decline of 3.3%. Gross profit was $1.776 billion in 2008, compared to $1.662 billion in 2007. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements. See attached tables for wholesale shipment and selected retail share data comparing 2008 and 2007.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a $66 million litigation charge in 2007, partially offset by an increase in legal expenses of $25 million in 2008 and $18 million of costs related to the separation of Lorillard from Loews.
Other income declined $90 million due to lower yields and a lower average invested asset balance. Other income in 2008 includes losses from limited partnership investments totaling $0.6 million. Lorillard's investments in limited partnerships, which generated $34 million in investment income in 2007, were substantially reduced during the first quarter of 2008.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 38.2% in 2008 compared to 35.1% in 2007, which increased income tax expense by $44 million, primarily due to the impact of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period, the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2007.
 
Net income for 2008 was $887 million, or $5.15 per share, compared to $898 million, or $5.16 per share in 2007. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in 2008 than in 2007 resulting from the share repurchase program completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.05.
