Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, NC, April 27, 2009Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE:LO) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Highlights
"We are pleased with our results for the quarter despite the extraordinary inventory adjustments that occurred related to the Federal Excise Tax increase and the impact of the current macroeconomic pressures," said Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and CEO of Lorillard, Inc. "We remain focused on our core strategy of balancing profitability with Newport share growth, which has allowed us to maintain our leading position in the menthol category."
First Quarter 2009 Results
Net sales were $917 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $921 million in the first quarter of 2008. The 0.4% decrease in net sales reflects lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales, partially offset by higher average unit prices. Gross profit was $385 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $366 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects lower manufacturing costs and lower costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, partially offset by a decrease in net sales.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the first quarter of 2009 of 7.909 billion units decreased 7.6% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 8.2% for the same period. Total industry shipments decreased an estimated 10.4% for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. Newport's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 10.6% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008.
Wholesale shipment volume in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same quarter of 2008 for Lorillard and for the total industry was negatively impacted by tax-driven trade purchasing patterns in anticipation of the $0.62 increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack on April 1, 2009. This legislation included provisions that imposed this increase in excise taxes on inventory held as of March 31, 2009 (a "floor tax"). As a result, many wholesalers and retailers depleted their inventory levels as of that date to minimize any such floor taxes owed based on inventory. Additionally, the first quarter of 2009 contained one less shipping day than the first quarter of 2008. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
 
On March 6, 2009, Lorillard increased its wholesale selling prices by $0.71 per pack to cover the increase in the federal excise tax and other costs.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its retail market share during the first quarter of 2009 by 0.2 share points from 9.9% in the first quarter of 2008 to 10.1% in the first quarter of 2009. See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2009 to $91 million compared to the first quarter 2008, which included a $13 million charge related to the separation from Loews. First quarter 2009 results included a $5 million decrease in marketing costs and a $9 million increase in legal expenses due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases. Operating income in the first quarter of 2009 was $294 million, or 32.1% of sales, compared to $266 million, or 28.9% of sales, in the same year ago period.
Other income declined $8 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008, due to lower yields on investments. Investments in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2009 include $1.327 billion in government money market funds and $155 million in repurchase agreements with various financial institutions.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.7% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 36.8% in the first quarter of 2008, which increased income tax expense by $3 million primarily due to an increase in state tax rates in 2009.
Net income in the first quarter of 2009 was $184 million, or $1.09 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $174 million, or $1.00 per share in the first quarter of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2009 than in the first quarter of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase program completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.04.
Additional News
On February 18, 2009, Lorillard announced a quarterly dividend on its common stock, in the amount of $0.92, payable March 12, 2009 to shareholders of record March 2, 2009.
