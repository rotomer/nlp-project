Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, N.C., May 21, 2009  Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE: LO) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock. Purchases by the Company under this program may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by the Company's management. The purchases will be funded from existing cash balances.
This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. The timing, frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Company's business, current stock price, market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and has no set expiration date.
The new share repurchase program follows on the prior authorization by the Board on July 9, 2008 to repurchase in the aggregate up to $400 million of its outstanding common stock, which was completed on October 10, 2008.
In addition, the Board of Directors has also authorized management to proceed with its previously announced intent to enhance its capital structure through a debt financing in order to reduce the Company's cost of capital and improve shareholder returns. Proceeds of any such financing may be used to fund additional stock repurchases, acquisitions, dividends or for other general corporate purposes. The timing, structure and amount of such indebtedness will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the credit and interest rate environment and other considerations. We presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding such a transaction, and there can be no assurance that Lorillard will be able to obtain debt financing at the anticipated levels or on attractive terms.
