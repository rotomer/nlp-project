          (m) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.

          (b) Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company and the Guarantor may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the

provided
however
          (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , , that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company and the Guarantor under Section 7(a) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company and the Guarantor in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company and the Guarantor have failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company and the Guarantor. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (A) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
provided
however
 
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 7(c) above).
          (e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 7, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
          8. .
Substitution of Underwriters
          (a) If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 7 of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 8.
          (b) If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representative may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order that the Company may effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of the Representative, may thereby be made necessary.
          (c) Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.
          9. .
Termination
          (a) Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any of the events described in Sections 6(l) and 6(m) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (iii) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(f) and 7 hereof.
          (b) Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 11 of this Agreement in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, will be immediately confirmed in writing.

Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee and in such manner as shall be specified in such Security.

The terms of such Securities, as set forth above, may be determined by the Company from time to time if so provided in or established pursuant to the authority granted in a Board Resolution. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time, and unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened for issuance of additional Securities of such series.
          SECTION 302 Denominations and Currencies.
     Unless otherwise provided with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 301, any Securities of a series shall be issuable only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 or the equivalent
 
amount thereof as determined by the Company in the case of Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit.
          SECTION 303 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, or one or more of its Presidents or Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
     Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, executed by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and such Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If all the Securities of any one series are not to be issued at one time and if a Board Resolution relating to such Securities shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities, including, without limitation, procedures with respect to interest rate, Stated Maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue.
     Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution otherwise required pursuant to Section 201 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such document is delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein manually executed by the Trustee for such Security or on its behalf pursuant to Section 614, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301 for a Global Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation.
     In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such Trustee, or any successor Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
          SECTION 304 Temporary Securities and Exchange of Securities.
     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any particular series, the Company may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner specified in Section 303, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any denomination, with like terms and conditions as the definitive Securities of like series in lieu of which they are issued in registered form and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such
 
Securities. Any such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
     Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged only in accordance with the provisions thereof), if temporary Securities of any particular series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of such definitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series, at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any particular series, the Company shall execute and (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first definitive Security of such series) the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions. Until exchanged as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and with like terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     Any temporary Global Security and any permanent Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to a Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301.
          SECTION 305 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee for the Securities of each series a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee for the Securities of each series is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities of such series as herein provided.
     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any particular series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for the Securities of each series shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions.
     At the option of the Holder, Securities of any particular series may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 304, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     If at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series in registered form notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 303, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities for such series. If (i) a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee for Securities of such series in registered form a Company Order stating that the Securities of such series shall be exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default under Section 501 hereof has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of such series, the Company's election pursuant
 
to Section 301 shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities for such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities in registered form, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series of like tenor and terms and in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
     Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Securities issued in definitive form in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Security to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such series duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1104 and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption as a whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
     Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 305, the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities if, as a result of the exchange, the Company would suffer adverse consequences under any United States law or regulation.
 
          SECTION 306 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     If (i) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee for such Security or the Company and the Company receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) there is delivered to the Company and such Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or such Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a "protected purchaser" (as defined in Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code), the Company shall execute and upon its request such Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for such mutilated Security, a new Security of the same series and in a like principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and such Trustee and any agent of either of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including all fees and expenses of the Trustee for such Security) connected therewith.
     Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for any mutilated Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
          SECTION 307 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, if so provided in such Security, be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment.
     Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed or delivered to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer or other electronic means to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located inside the United States.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series, whether having identical or different terms and provisions, having the same Interest Payment Dates will, at the option of the Company, be entitled to receive interest payments, other than at Maturity, by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee for the Securities of such series at least 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Any wire instructions received by the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall remain in effect until revoked by the Holder.
     Unless otherwise provided or contemplated by Section 301, every permanent Global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to each of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable with respect to that portion of such permanent Global Security held for its account by the
 
Depositary. Each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will in such circumstances credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
     Any interest on any Security of any particular series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee for the Securities of such series in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of that series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with such Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to such Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon such Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by such Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. Such Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of that series at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities of any particular series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice is given by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of the proposed manner of payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by such Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
          SECTION 308 Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee for such Security and any agent of the Company or such Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, such Trustee or any agent of the Company or such Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
 
          SECTION 309 Cancellation.
     All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund payment, shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee for such Securities, be delivered to such Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it in its customary manner. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for Securities of a series for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by such Trustee in its customary manner. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, in the case of a series, all the Securities of which are not to be originally issued at one time, a Security of such series shall not be deemed to have been Outstanding at any time hereunder if and to the extent that, subsequent to the authentication and delivery thereof, such Security is delivered to the Trustee for such Security for cancellation by the Company or any agent thereof upon the failure of the original purchaser thereof to make payment therefor against delivery thereof, and any Security so delivered to such Trustee shall be promptly canceled by it in its customary manner. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities held by the Trustee for such Securities shall be disposed of by such Trustee in accordance with its standard procedures and, upon the Company's written request, a certificate of disposition evidencing such disposition of Securities shall be provided to the Company by such Trustee.
          SECTION 310 Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any particular series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
          SECTION 311 Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
     Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the following provisions shall apply:
     (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Security of such series will be made in the currency or currency unit in which such Security is payable.
     (b) With respect to any Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit and payable in Dollars, the amount of Dollars so payable will be determined by the Currency Determination Agent based on the indicative quotation in The City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date that yields the largest number of Dollars on conversion of Foreign Currency or currency units. Such selection shall be made from among the quotations appearing on the bank composite or multi-contributor pages of the Reuters Monitor Foreign Exchange Service or, if not available, the Telerate Monitor Foreign Exchange Service, for three (or two if three are not available) major banks in The City of New York. The first three (or two) such banks selected by the Currency Determination Agent which are offering quotes on the Reuters Foreign Exchange Service, as the case may be, shall be used. If such quotations are unavailable from either such foreign exchange service, such selection shall be made from the quotations received by the Currency Determination Agent from no more than three nor less than two recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be the Currency Determination Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Foreign Currency or currency unit payable on such payment date in respect of all Securities denominated in such Foreign Currency or currency unit and for which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If fewer than two such bid quotations are available at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date, such payment will be based on the Market Exchange Rate as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date. If the Market Exchange Rate for such date is not then available, payments shall be made in the Foreign Currency or currency unit.
 
     (c) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency or currency unit in which Securities of any series are payable, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of that series occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency or currency unit was used, the Company may make such payment in Dollars. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent for the Securities of such series to the Holders of such Securities with respect to such payment date shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate, or as otherwise established pursuant to Section 301 with respect to such Notes. Any payment in respect of such Security made under such circumstances in Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default hereunder.
     (d) For purposes of this Indenture the following term shall have the following meaning:
     A "" shall mean any currency which is a component currency of any currency unit.
Component Currency
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 311, the following shall apply: (i) if the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of that currency as a component shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion, (ii) if two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of those currencies as components shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such a single currency, (iii) if any Component Currency is divided into two or more currencies, the amount of that original Component Currency as a component shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies having an aggregate value on the date of division equal to the amount of the former Component Currency immediately before such division and (iv) in the event of an official redenomination of any currency (including, without limitation, a currency unit), the obligations of the Company to make payments in or with reference to such currency on the Securities of any series shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to be obligations to make payments in or with reference to that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such currency immediately before such redenomination.
     (f) All determinations referred to in this Section 311 made by the Currency Determination Agent shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Holders of the applicable Securities. The Currency Determination Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of any such decision or determination. The Currency Determination Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Trustee of any such decision or determination. The Currency Determination Agent shall have no liability for any determinations referred to in this Section 311 made by it in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence.
     (g) The Trustee for the Securities of a particular series shall be fully justified and protected in conclusively relying and acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Currency Determination Agent with respect to any of the matters addressed in or contemplated by this Section 311 and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
          SECTION 312 Appointment and Resignation of Currency Determination Agent.
          (a) If and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company shall maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, a Currency Determination Agent. The Company shall cause the Currency Determination Agent to make the necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in the manner specified pursuant to Section 301 for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of exchange and for the purpose of converting the issued currency or currency unit into the applicable payment currency or currency unit for the payment of principal, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 311.
 
          (b) No resignation of the Currency Determination Agent and no appointment of a successor Currency Determination Agent pursuant to this Section shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Currency Determination Agent as evidenced by a written instrument delivered to the Company and the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities accepting such appointment executed by the successor Currency Determination Agent.
          (c) If the Currency Determination Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Currency Determination Agent for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Currency Determination Agent or Currency Determination Agents with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Currency Determination Agent may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall only be one Currency Determination Agent with respect to the Securities of any particular series).
          SECTION 313 CUSIP and ISIN Numbers.
     The Company in issuing any series of the Securities may use "CUSIP" and "ISIN" numbers, in each case if then generally in use, and thereafter with respect to such series, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may use such numbers in any notice of redemption or exchange with respect to such series, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities of that series or as contained in any notice of a redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities of that series, and any such redemption or exchange shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
provided
          SECTION 401 Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
     The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to the Securities of any series, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a particular series of Securities, elect to have either Section 402 or 403 be applied to all of the Outstanding Securities of that series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Four.
          SECTION 402 Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 402, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities of the particular series on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the obligations relating to the Outstanding Securities of that series and the Securities of that series shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 406, Section 408 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 402, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on written demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities of the particular series to receive payments in respect of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities when such payments are due or on the Redemption Date solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture; (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities concerning issuing temporary Securities of that series, or, where relevant, registration of such Securities, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of that series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for Security payments held in trust; (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee for the Securities of that series, and the Company's obligations in connection therewith; and (d) this Article Four and the obligations set forth in Section 406 hereof.
 
     Subject to compliance with this Article Four, the Company may exercise its option under Section 402 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 403 with respect to the Securities of a particular series.
          SECTION 403 Covenant Defeasance.
     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 403, the Company shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 704, 801, 1007 and 1008 hereof with respect to the Outstanding Securities of the particular series on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Securities of that series shall thereafter be deemed not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of that series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or Event of Default under subsection 501(3) but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be unaffected thereby.
          SECTION 404 Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.

     (e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound; and

          SECTION 502 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     If an Event of Default with respect to any particular series of Securities occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5)), then and in every such case either the Trustee for the Securities of such series or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the entire principal amount (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to such Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration of acceleration such principal or such lesser amount, as the case may be, together with accrued interest and all other amounts owing hereunder, shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.
     If any Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount (or, if the Securities of any series then outstanding are (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) and accrued interest on all Securities of each series then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders of each series of Securities to receive additional interest on the Securities of that particular series equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Securities of such series. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the Securities of that particular series. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Securities from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of this paragraph will not affect the rights of Holders in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
     In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 120 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must notify all Holders of each series of Securities, the Trustee for the Securities of such series and the Paying Agent for the Securities of such series of such election by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as provided below on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. Upon the Company's failure to deliver such Officers' Certificate or pay the additional interest specified in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
     If the Company elects to pay additional interest, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to that effect stating that (i) the amount of such additional interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such additional interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no additional interest is payable. If the Company has paid additional interest directly to the Persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.
 
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee for the Securities of any series as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and such Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (1) the Company has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)):
     (A) all overdue interest, if any, on all Securities of that series;
     (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon from the date such principal became due at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities), to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable;
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities); and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by such Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607;
     and
     (2) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          SECTION 503 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if:
     (1) default is made in the payment of any interest upon any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days; or
     (2) default is made in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on any Security of any series at its Maturity;
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee for the Securities of such series, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, with interest upon the overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by such Securities (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities); and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee (including the compensation and reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel) and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607.
 
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, such Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company, the Guarantor (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, the Guarantor (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any particular series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
          SECTION 504 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company, the Guarantor (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or the property of the Company, the Guarantor (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee for the Securities of such series irrespective of whether the principal (or, if the Securities of such series are (i) OID Securities or (ii) Indexed Securities, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such Securities pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 502) on any Security of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company or the Guarantor (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) for the payment of overdue principal or interest shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of such series are (i) OID Securities or (ii) Indexed Securities, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such Securities pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 502), premium, if any, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of such series and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of such Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee (including the compensation and reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel) and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of the Securities of such series allowed in such judicial proceeding;
     (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and
     (iii) unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of the Securities of such series in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities to make such payments to such Trustee, and in the event that such Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities, to pay to such Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee (including the compensation and reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), and any other amounts due such Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee for the Securities of any series to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of such series, the Guarantees (in the case of Guaranteed Securities) or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee for the Securities of any series to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding, except as aforesaid, for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions.
 
          SECTION 505 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities of any series may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee for the Securities of any series without the possession of any of the Securities of such series or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by such Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
          SECTION 506 Application of Money Collected.
     Any money collected by the Trustee for the Securities of any series pursuant to this Article with respect to the Securities of such series shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by such Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities of such series, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     FIRST: to the payment of all amounts due such Trustee under Section 607;
     SECOND: to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series for principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, respectively; and
     THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
          SECTION 507 Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of any Security of any particular series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
     (1) an Event of Default with respect to that series shall have occurred and be continuing and such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of such default and the continuance thereof;
     (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee for the Securities of such series to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
     (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
     (4) such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Securities of that series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of that series, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority or preference over any
 
other of such Holders of Securities of that series or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Securities of that series (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).
          SECTION 508 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium, if any, and Interest, if any.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
          SECTION 509 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee for the Securities of any series or any Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, such Trustee and the Holders of Securities shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Trustee and such Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
          SECTION 510 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee for the Securities of any series or to the Holders of Securities is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
          SECTION 511 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee for the Securities of any series or of any Holder of any Security of such series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to such Trustee for the Securities of any series or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
          SECTION 512 Control by Holders.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee for the Securities of such series with respect to the Securities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee with respect to such Securities, provided that:
     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability; and
     (2) such Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
          SECTION 513 Waiver of Past Defaults.
     The Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series waive any past default hereunder with respect to that series and its consequences, except:
     (1) a default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of that series; or
     (2) a default with respect to a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of that series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          SECTION 514 Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for the Securities of any series for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee for the Securities of any series, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security for the enforcement of the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of such series on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
          SECTION 515 Judgment Currency.
     If, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Security, it shall become necessary to convert any amount in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security into any other currency or currency unit, then such conversion shall be made by the Currency Determination Agent at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of entry of the judgment (the "Judgment Date"). If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date (the "Substitute Date") other than the Judgment Date and there shall occur a change between the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Substitute Date, the Company agrees to pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount in such other currency or currency unit which, when converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date, is the amount due hereunder or under such Security. Any amount due from the Company under this Section 515 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or in respect of any Security. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date than the amount of currency or currency unit stated to be due hereunder or under such Security so that in any event the Company's obligations hereunder or under such Security will be effectively maintained as obligations in such currency or currency unit, and the Company shall be entitled to withhold (or be reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion on the Substitute Date over the amount due and payable on the Judgment Date.
 
          SECTION 601 Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
          (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series for which the Trustee is serving as such,
          (1) such Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against such Trustee; and
          (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, such Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to such Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to such Trustee, such Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
          (b) In case an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
          (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee for Securities of any series from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
          (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
          (2) such Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
          (3) such Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series, determined as provided in Section 512, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon such Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series; and
          (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee for any series of Securities to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
          (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee for any series of Securities shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
 
          SECTION 602 Notice of Defaults.
     Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to Securities of any particular series, the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall give to Holders of Securities of that series, in the manner set forth in Section 106, notice of such default known to such Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; , , that, except in the case of a default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of that series, or in the deposit of any sinking fund payment with respect to Securities of that series, such Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of such Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of that series; and , , that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(3) with respect to Securities of that series no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of that series.

     (3) to indemnify such Trustee and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, in any of its capacities hereunder and with respect to any particular series, in Dollars for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on income of the Trustee) incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, a Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Company is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Trustee may have separate counsel in defending any such claim and the Company shall pay the fees and reasonable expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
     As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section the Trustee for any series of Securities shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by such Trustee as such.
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or (5), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.
     The Company's obligations under this Section 607 and any lien arising hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the discharge of the Company's obligations pursuant to Article Four of this Indenture and/or the termination of this Indenture. The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of Section 313(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent applicable.
          SECTION 608 Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
     The Trustee for the Securities shall be subject to the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act during the period of time required thereby. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. In determining whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest as defined in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the Securities of any series, there shall be excluded Securities of any particular series of Securities other than that series.
          SECTION 609 Corporate Trustee Required; Different Trustees for Different Series; Eligibility.
     There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be
     (i) a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and subject to supervision or examination by federal or State authority, or
 
     (ii) a corporation or other Person organized and doing business under the laws of a foreign government that is permitted to act as Trustee pursuant to a rule, regulation, or other order of the Commission, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and subject to supervision or examination by authority of such foreign government or a political subdivision thereof substantially equivalent to supervision or examination applicable to United States institutional trustees,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. Neither the Company nor any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under the common control with the Company shall serve as Trustee for the Securities. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereunder specified in this Article. This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of Sections 310(a)(1), (2) and (5) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Trustee is subject to Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.
     A different Trustee may be appointed by the Company for each series of Securities prior to the issuance of such Securities. If the initial Trustee for any series of Securities is to be other than The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Company and such Trustee shall, prior to the issuance of such Securities, execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto, which shall provide for the appointment of such Trustee as Trustee for the Securities of such series and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. No Trustee hereunder shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any other Trustee hereunder.
          SECTION 610 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
          (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee for the Securities of any series and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
          (b) The Trustee for the Securities of any series may resign at any time, with 60 days' prior written notice, with respect to the Securities of such series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee for the Securities of such series within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
          (c) The Trustee for the Securities of any series may be removed at any time, with 60 days' prior written notice, with respect to the Securities of such series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to such Trustee and to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee for the Securities of such series within 60 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
          (d) If at any time:
     (1) the Trustee for the Securities of any series shall fail to comply with Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act pursuant to Section 608 hereof after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, or
 
     (2) such Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
     (3) such Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of such Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove such Trustee or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of such Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          (e) If the Trustee for the Securities of any series shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for the Securities of any series for any cause, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within 180 days after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee for the Securities of such series and supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee for the Securities of such series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and shall have accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, and if such Trustee is still incapable of acting, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
          (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
          SECTION 611 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
          (a) Every such successor Trustee appointed hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
          (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same
 
trust and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges hereunder, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
          (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
          (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee for the Securities of any series shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
          SECTION 612 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
     Any corporation into which the Trustee for the Securities of any series may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of such Trustee, shall be the successor of such Trustee hereunder, such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee or Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
provided
          SECTION 613 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
     If and when the Trustee shall be or shall become a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured, of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Debt Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated.
          SECTION 614 Authenticating Agents.
     From time to time the Trustee for the Securities of any series may, subject to its sole discretion, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with respect to the Securities of such series, which may include the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, with power to act on the Trustee's behalf and subject to its discretion in the authentication and delivery of Securities of such series in connection with transfers and exchanges under Sections 304, 305 and 1107 as fully to all intents and purposes as though such Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections of this Indenture to authenticate and deliver Securities of such series. For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Securities of such series by an Authenticating Agent for such Securities pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of such Securities "by the Trustee" for the Securities of such series. Any such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually pursuant to law or the requirements of such supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
     Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or the Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.
     Any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company in the manner set forth in Section 105. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible under this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Company agrees to pay to any Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable compensation for its services.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series of Securities is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certification of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
     "This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
     With respect to each particular series of Securities, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee for the Securities of such series,
     (a) semiannually, not more than 15 days after each Regular Record Date relating to that series (or, if there is no Regular Record Date relating to that series, on June 30 and December 31), a list, in such form as such Trustee may reasonably require, containing all the information in the possession or control of the Company or any of its Paying Agents other than such Trustee as to the names and addresses of the Holders of that series as of such dates,
 
     (b) on semi-annual dates on each year to be determined pursuant to Section 301 if the Securities of such series do not bear interest, a list of similar form and content, and
     (c) at such other times as such Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished,
excluding from any such list names and addresses received by such Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar for the Securities of such series, if so acting.

          (a) The Trustee for each series of Securities shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders of the Securities of such series contained in the most recent lists furnished to such Trustee as provided in Section 701 and the names and addresses of Holders of the Securities of such series received by such Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar for such series, if so acting. The Trustee for each series of Securities may destroy any list relating to such series of Securities furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list relating to such series so furnished.
          (b) If three or more Holders of Securities of any particular series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee for the Securities of any such series, and furnish to such Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security of that series for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Securities of that series with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities of that series and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then such Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either
     (i) afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), or
     (ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Securities of that series whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
     If any such Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to that information, such Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder of Securities of that series whose name and address appear in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to such Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, such Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of such Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Securities of that series or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, such Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise such Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
          (c) Every Holder of Securities of each series, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee for the Securities of such series that neither the Company nor such Trustee, nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names
 
and addresses of the Holders of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section 702(b).
          SECTION 703 Reports by Trustee.
          (a) Within 60 days after May 15 of each year, the Trustee for the Securities of each series shall mail to each Holder of the Securities of such series entitled to receive reports pursuant to Section 704(3), a brief report dated as of such date that complies with Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Trustee for the Securities of each series shall also comply with Sections 313(b), 313(c) and 313(d) of the Trust Indenture Act.
          (b) At the time that the Trustee for the Securities of each series mails such a report to the Holders of Securities of such series, each such Trustee shall file a copy of that report with the Commission and with each stock exchange on which the Securities of that series are listed.

          SECTION 704 Reports by Company and Guarantor.
     The Guarantor will:
     (1) file with the Trustee for the Securities of such series, within 30 days after the Guarantor is required (taking into account any extension of due dates due to compliance with Rule 12b-25 or comparable provision under the Exchange Act) to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Guarantor may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
          SECTION 801 Company and Guarantor May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms.

     It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
 
          SECTION 903 Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
     In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee for any series of Securities shall receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee for the Securities of such series and the Board of Directors, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and such Securities may be authenticated and delivered by such Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
          SECTION 1001 Payment of Principal, Premium, if any, and Interest, if any.
     The Company agrees, for the benefit of each particular series of Securities, that it will duly and punctually pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)) principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on that series of Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series and this Indenture.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of each series so affected of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such office or agency.
provided, however

          SECTION 1003 Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any particular series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of principal of, and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)) sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee for the Securities of such series of its action or failure so to act.
     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any particular series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any such Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent for the Securities of such series a sum (in the currency or currency unit described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee for the Securities of such series) the Company will promptly notify such Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any particular series of Securities other than the Trustee for the Securities of such series to execute and deliver to such Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with such Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
     (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as Paying Agent and hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
     (2) give such Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on Securities of that series; and
     (3) at any time during the continuation of any such default, upon the written request of such Trustee, forthwith pay to such Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee for the Securities of any series all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by such Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon
 
such payment by any Paying Agent to such Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
          SECTION 1004 Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

          (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will sell or transfer a Principal Facility now owned or hereafter acquired with the intention of taking back a lease of such property, except a lease for a temporary period of less than 3 years, including renewals, with the intent that the use by the Company or a Subsidiary will be discontinued on or before the expiration of such period (any transaction subject to the provisions of this Section 1008 being herein referred to as a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless the Company shall apply an amount equal to the value of the property so leased to the retirement (other than any mandatory retirement), within 180 days of the effective date of any such arrangement, of non-subordinated indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company which had a stated maturity of more than one year from the date of its creation.
          (b) The Company or a Subsidiary may enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction which would otherwise be prohibited by Subsection (a) of this Section 1008, provided that the value thereof plus the aggregate indebtedness permitted to be secured under the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 1007 does not at the time exceed a percentage of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets specified for such series of Securities in accordance with Section 301.

provided
however
 
     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof and premium, if any, thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Security (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Security's Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities).
          SECTION 1107 Securities Redeemed in Part.

     Redemption of Securities through operation of a sinking fund as permitted or required by any form of Security issued pursuant to this Indenture shall be made in accordance with such form of Security and this Article; , , that if any provision of any such form of Security shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of Security shall govern.
provided
however
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any particular series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any particular series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any particular series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any particular series as provided for by the terms of Securities of that series.
          SECTION 1202 Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments With Securities.
     The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption), and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; , , that such Securities have not been previously so credited.

Such Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
          SECTION 1301 Guarantee.
     Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of this Article Thirteen shall be applicable only to, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Securities of any series designated pursuant to Section 301 as entitled to the benefits of the Guarantee of the Guarantor. If specified pursuant to Section 301, the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities of that series is to be guaranteed ("Guarantee") by the Guarantor, the Guarantor shall execute and deliver a guarantee agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Guarantee Agreement"), the terms and conditions of which are incorporated in this Article Thirteen by reference and made a part hereof.
     An Event of Default under the Securities of that series shall constitute an event of default under this Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement, and shall entitle the Holders of such Securities or the Trustee (acting at the written direction of the Holders) to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantor under this Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company under the Indenture.
     The Guarantee shall be a guarantee of payment and not of collection.
     The Guarantor hereby agrees to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all costs and expenses (including the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel) incurred by the Trustee under this Indenture or by any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 1301.
          SECTION 1302 Execution and Delivery of Indenture and Guarantee Agreement.
     To further evidence the Guarantee set forth in Section 1301, the Guarantor hereby agrees that a Guarantee Agreement shall be executed by either manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized officer of the Guarantor.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, LORILLARD TOBACCO COMPANY has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated:
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $ (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, among the Company, Lorillard, Inc., as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as ___% Notes due (the "Notes").
                    
                    
     [The Notes have the benefit of the unconditional guarantee by the Guarantor to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes, according to the terms of and as more fully described in the Indenture and the related Guarantee Agreement executed by the Guarantor on the date hereof.]
     [The Notes are subject to redemption as a whole or in part at any time on or after , at the option of the Company, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice given as provided in the Indenture, at the redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
                    
     In the event of the redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes in the amount of the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.]
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the Notes due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
     Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation to provide certain reports and information as set forth in Section 704 of the Indenture will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders to receive additional interest on the Notes equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Notes. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the Notes. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in the paragraph above. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in paragraph above.
 
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company [and the Guarantor] with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series of Securities then Outstanding affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at any other office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof or the equivalent amount thereof in the case of Notes denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Company, the Trustee for the Notes and any agent of the Company or such Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, such Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.

If an Event of Default with respect to any particular series of Securities occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5)), then and in every such case either the Trustee for the Securities of such series or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the entire principal amount (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to such Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration of acceleration such principal or such lesser amount, as the case may be, together with accrued interest and all other amounts owing hereunder, shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.
If any Event of Default specified in Section 501(4), 501(5), 501(7) or 501(8) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount (or, if the Securities of any series then outstanding are (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) and accrued interest on all Securities of each series then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders of each series of Securities to receive additional interest on the Securities of that particular series equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Securities of such series. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the Securities of that particular series. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Securities from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of this paragraph will not affect the rights of Holders in the
 
event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 120 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must notify all Holders of each series of Securities, the Trustee for the Securities of such series and the Paying Agent for the Securities of such series of such election by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as provided below on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. Upon the Company's failure to deliver such Officers' Certificate or pay the additional interest specified in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
If the Company elects to pay additional interest, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to that effect stating that (i) the amount of such additional interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such additional interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no additional interest is payable. If the Company has paid additional interest directly to the Persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee for the Securities of any series as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and such Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)):
     (A) all overdue interest, if any, on all Securities of that series;
     (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon from the date such principal became due
 
at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities), to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable;
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities); and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by such Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607;
and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(b) The Company and/or any Subsidiary may create, assume or incur, or suffer to be created, assumed or incurred, liens which would otherwise be prohibited by Subsection (a) of this Section 1007, provided that the indebtedness secured thereby, plus the aggregate value of the Sale and Leaseback Transactions permitted by the provisions of Subsection (b) of Section 1008, does not at the time exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
(b) The Company or a Subsidiary may enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction which would otherwise be prohibited by Subsection (a) of this Section 1008, that the value thereof plus the aggregate indebtedness permitted to be secured under the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 1007 does not at the time exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

Section 1010
Interest Rate Adjustment
(a) The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, in the manner described in this Section 1010.
(b) If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase such that it shall equal the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
(c) If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase such that it shall equal the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
(d) If at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the
 
interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, and S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date. In addition, the interest rates on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described in subsections (b) and (c) above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the Notes become rated A3 and A- (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency).
(e) Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on their Issue Date or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date.
(f) No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Notes. If at any time fewer than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes for a reason beyond the Company's control, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the tables in subsections (b) and (c) above (1) such Substitute Rating Agency shall be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (2) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt shall be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table in subsection (b) or (c) above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (3) the interest rate on the Notes shall increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table in subsection (b) or
 
(c)above (taking into account the provisions of clause (2) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the Rating Agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table in subsection (b) or (c) above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes for reasons within the Company's control, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes on their Issue Date.
(g) Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof) changes its rating of the Notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency shall control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the Notes described above relating to such rating agency's action.
(h) Promptly after any change in the interest rate payable on the Notes as provided in this Section 1010, the Company shall provide the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the interest rate payable on the Notes has changed in accordance with this provision and setting forth the amount of the related increase or decrease and the new interest rate payable on the Notes and setting forth the effective date of any change in the interest rate payable on the Notes and shall provide notice of the same to Holders. The Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the ratings of the Notes to determine whether there has been any increase or decrease in such rating or for calculating the new interest rate payable on the Notes in the event of any increase or decrease in the ratings of the Notes.
(i) If the interest rate payable on the Notes is increased as described above, the term "interest," as used with respect to the Notes, shall be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.

Section 1011
Repurchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event
(a) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each Holder of Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $1,000) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") of payment in cash
 
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment").
(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
(c) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
(i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased.
(d) The Paying Agent shall promptly remit to each Holder of properly tendered Notes the Change of Control Payment for the Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; that each new Note shall be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $1,000.
provided
(e) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set for an offer made by the Company, and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a
 
default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
(f) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 14e-1 thereunder and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 1011, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 1011 by virtue of any such conflict.

Section 5.
provided
      All covenants and agreements in this First Supplemental Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

     This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
          This Note is one of a series of the Senior Notes designated therein as 8.125% Notes due June 23, 2019 (the "Notes").This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $750,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Notes issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, by and among the Company, Lorillard, Inc., as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Notes and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Notes and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. Each holder of a Note, by acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by the terms of this Note and the within referenced Indenture.
Guarantee
          The Notes have the benefit of the unconditional guarantee by the Guarantor to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes, according to the terms of and as more fully described in the Indenture and the related Guarantee Agreement executed by the Guarantor on the date hereof.
Defeasance
          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Notes of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
Events of Default
          If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the Notes due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture.

such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders to receive additional interest on the Notes equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Notes. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the Notes. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in the paragraph above. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in paragraph above.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
Payment
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.

     In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have examined originals, photocopies or conformed copies of certain records of the Issuer and the Guarantor, certain agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Issuer and the Guarantor and certain other documents. In such examinations, we have assumed the
 
genuineness of all signatures on original documents and the conformity to the originals of all copies submitted to us as conformed or photocopied.
     Based on the foregoing, we advise you that in our opinion:
     1. The Notes have been duly issued and delivered and, assuming the due execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee and the due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee, are valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
     2. The Guarantee has been duly issued and delivered and, assuming the due execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee and the due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee, is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
     We are members of the bar of the State of New York, and in rendering this opinion we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Form 8-K filed by the Issuer and the Guarantor in connection with the issuance of the Notes. Such consent does not constitute a consent under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, and by giving such consent we have not certified any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement and do not otherwise admit that we are within the categories of persons whose consent is required under said Section 7 or under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
