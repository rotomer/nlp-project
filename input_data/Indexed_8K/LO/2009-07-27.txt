Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, NC, July 27, 2009Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE:LO) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Highlights
"We are pleased to report strong second quarter results despite the impact of the increase of the federal excise tax on April 1, 2009 and the overall economic environment. These results clearly reflect the continuing success of our strategy of balancing profitability and nurturing Newport's market share. Our second quarter volumes were, to a degree, positively impacted by the adjustments in our wholesale customers' inventory levels following the federal excise tax increase. We remain cautious about unit volumes going forward, however, in anticipation of continuing increases in state excise taxes and the longer term effects of the higher federal excise tax," stated Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We have taken steps to enhance our capital structure through a debt financing and two share repurchase programs, one of which is announced today. These steps will allow us to reduce the Company's cost of capital and improve shareholder returns."
Second Quarter 2009 Results
Net sales were $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $1.070 billion in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of $449 million. $304 million of that increase was the result of the April 1, 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in the second quarter of 2009 increased $147 million, or 16.6% from the second quarter of 2008 as the result of higher average unit prices and higher net unit sales volume, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. Gross profit was $554 million in the second quarter of 2009, or 53.6% of net sales excluding excise taxes compared to $443 million, or 50.0% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the second quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs due to higher unit sales volume, higher federal excise taxes and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the second quarter of 2009 of 9.871 billion units increased 2.1% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Total industry wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 4.1% for the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments increased 2.1% for the same period. This increase in domestic wholesale shipments in
 
the second quarter of 2009 reflects the impact of wholesalers and retailers partially restoring their inventory levels after depleting them in the first quarter of 2009 to minimize floor taxes on inventory held at the time of the April 1, 2009 increase in federal excise taxes. Newport's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 1.2%, while Maverick's domestic wholesale shipments increased 67.6% in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the second quarter of 2009 by .44 share points from 9.94% in the second quarter of 2008 to 10.38% in the second quarter of 2009. See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million, or 7.7% in the second quarter of 2009 to $98 million compared to the second quarter 2008, which included a $5 million charge related to the separation from Loews. The increase in the second quarter of 2009 is primarily due to a $3 million increase in pension costs and a $3 million increase in legal expenses due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases.
Investment income decreased $5 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments. Investments in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2009 were in government money market funds.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.1% in the second quarter of 2009 compared to 39.2% in the second quarter of 2008, which decreased income tax expense by $9 million. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the impact of, in 2008, the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates.
Net income in the second quarter of 2009 was $286 million, or $1.71 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $217 million, or $1.25 per share in the second quarter of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2009 than in the second quarter of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008 and May 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.06.
See following table for additional information regarding the impact of excise taxes on reported results:
 
First Half 2009 Results
Net sales were $2.436 billion in the first half of 2009, compared to $1.991 billion in the first half of 2008, an increase of $445 million. $304 million of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2009 increased $157 million, or 9.6% from the first half of 2008 as the result of higher average unit prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. During the first half of 2009, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments decreased by 2.8% versus an estimated industry decline of 7.1%. Gross profit was $940 million, or 52.2% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2009, compared to $810 million, or 49.3% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher federal excise taxes and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements. See attached tables for wholesale and selected retail share data comparing first six months of 2009 and 2008.
Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $2 million, or 1.0% in the first half of 2009 to $189 million compared to the first half 2008, which included an $18 million charge related to the separation from Loews. First half 2009 results included a $5 million increase in pension costs and a $12 million increase in legal expenses due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases.
Investment income decreased $14 million in the first half of 2009, compared to the first half of 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.4% in the first half of 2009 compared to 38.2% in the first half of 2008, which decreased income tax expense by $6 million. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the impact of, in 2008, the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates.
Net income in the first half of 2009 was $470 million, or $2.80 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $391 million, or $2.25 per share in the first half of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first half of 2009 than in the first half of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008 and May 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.10.
