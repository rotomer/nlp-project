Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, NC, October 26, 2009Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE:LO) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Highlights
"Lorillard's overall performance during the third quarter of 2009 was positive in terms of its domestic wholesale shipments out-performing the industry compared to the third quarter of 2008. Additionally, Newport's domestic retail market share continued to grow despite a challenging marketplace," noted Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain committed to Lorillard's core business strategy of balancing profitability with Newport's market share position and continue to return cash to shareholders, via the recent increase in our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program."
Orlowsky added, "Both our financial and marketplace results were relatively strong recognizing difficult comparative factors affecting the third quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter of 2008. These factors included a reduction in wholesale inventory levels during the third quarter of 2009, greater levels of Newport promotional product in the market in the third quarter of 2008 and the general on-going effects of the federal excise tax increase that occurred as of April 1, 2009. We have managed to improve earnings and margins in the face of these marketplace pressures and the approximately $0.05 per share impact on EPS in 2009 of incremental pension costs and effects of LIFO on our inventory valuation."
Third Quarter 2009 Results
Net sales were $1.419 billion in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $1.125 billion in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $294 million. $291 million of that increase was the result of the April 1, 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in the third quarter of 2009 increased $17 million, or 1.8% from the third quarter of 2008 as the result of higher average prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales. Gross profit was $488 million in the third quarter of 2009, or 51.2% of net sales excluding excise taxes compared to $470 million, or 50.2% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales, the absence of free product promotions and lower costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
 
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the third quarter of 2009 of 9.458 billion units decreased 6.3% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Total domestic industry wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 12.6% for the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 6.1% for the same period. This decrease in domestic wholesale shipments in the third quarter of 2009 reflects the impact of the $0.62 increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack on April 1, 2009. Newport's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 9.8%, while Maverick's domestic wholesale shipments increased 51.9% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the third quarter of 2009 by .28 share points to 10.29% in the third quarter of 2009 from 10.01% in the third quarter of 2008. See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $8 million, or 9.1% in the third quarter of 2009 to $96 million compared to the third quarter 2008. The increase in the third quarter of 2009 is primarily due to a $4 million increase in pension costs and a $5 million increase in legal expenses due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in marketing costs.
Investment income decreased $4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008 as a result of lower interest rates on investments. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2009 were held primarily in money market funds.
Interest expense increased $14 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008 and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009. In September 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify its exposure to interest rate risk, the effect of which results in changing the effective interest rate on the Senior Notes from a fixed rate to a variable rate.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.7% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 38.5% in the third quarter of 2008, which decreased income tax expense by $3 million. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period.
Net income in the third quarter of 2009 was $235 million, or $1.44 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $237 million, or $1.38 per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2009 than in the third quarter of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008, May 2009 and July 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.07.
See following table for additional information regarding the impact of excise taxes on reported results:
 
First Nine Months 2009 Results
Net sales were $3.855 billion in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $3.116 billion in the first nine months of 2008, an increase of $739 million. $595 million of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2009 increased $174 million, or 6.7% from the first nine months of 2008 as a result of higher average unit prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. During the first nine months of 2009, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments decreased by 4.0% versus an estimated industry decline of 8.9%. Gross profit was $1.425 billion, or 51.7% of sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $1.277 billion, or 49.5% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, lower costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the absence of free product promotions, partially offset by higher federal excise taxes and higher manufacturing costs.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $6 million, or 2.2% in the first nine months of 2009 to $282 million compared to the first nine months of 2008, which included an $18 million charge related to the separation from Loews. The first nine months of 2009 results included a $10 million increase in pension costs and a $17 million increase in legal expenses due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in marketing costs.
Investment income decreased $16 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the first nine months of 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments.
Interest expense increased $16 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the first nine months of 2008 and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.5% in the first nine months of 2009 compared to 38.3% in the first nine months of 2008, which decreased income tax expense by $9 million. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates.
Net income in the first nine months of 2009 was $706 million, or $4.24 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $629 million, or $3.63 per share (basic) and $3.62 per share (diluted) in the first nine months of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first nine months of 2009 than in the first nine months of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008, May 2009 and July 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.17.
