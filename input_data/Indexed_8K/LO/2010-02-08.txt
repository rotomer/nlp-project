Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, NC, February 8, 2010Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE:LO) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
Highlights
"Given the challenges presented by an unprecedented increase in the federal excise taxes on cigarettes in April 2009, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results were consistent with our long-standing strategic objective of balancing profitability and the improvement of the Newport brand's market share performance," stated Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "For 2009, our operating income increased by 8.9% over 2008 and Newport's 2009 domestic retail share reached 10.28%, as measured by the Company's proprietary retail database, up 0.36 points versus 2008. Lorillard again outperformed the domestic tobacco industry as Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments declined 3.9% in 2009 compared to 2008 versus an industry decrease of 8.6%."
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Results
Net sales were $1.378 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $1.088 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $290 million. $270 million of that increase was the result of the April 1, 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $20 million, or 2.2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of higher average prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales. Gross profit was $481 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, or 51.6% of net sales excluding excise taxes compared to $493 million, or 54.1% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in gross profit reflects higher manufacturing costs, higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, higher pension expense and the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees partially offset by higher net sales.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the fourth quarter of 2009 of 9.047 billion units decreased 4.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Total domestic industry wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 7.4% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 3.6% for the same period. This decrease in domestic wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflects the impact on demand of the $0.62 increase in the federal excise taxes on cigarettes from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack on April 1, 2009. Newport's domestic wholesale shipments decreased 6.5%, while Maverick's domestic wholesale shipments increased 39.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the fourth quarter of 2009 by 0.46 share points to 10.32% from 9.86% in the fourth quarter of 2008. See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $4 million, or 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $83 million compared to the fourth quarter 2008. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 is primarily due to a $2 million increase in pension costs and a $1 million increase in legal expenses due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases.
Interest expense increased $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $242 million, or $1.52 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $258 million, or $1.54 and $1.53 per share (basic and diluted respectively) in the fourth quarter of 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2009 than in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008, May 2009 and July 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.09.
 
See following table for additional information regarding the impact of excise taxes on reported results:
2009 Results
Net sales were $5.233 billion in 2009, compared to $4.204 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.029 billion. $835 million of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes. Net sales excluding excise taxes in 2009 increased $194 million, or 5.6% from 2008 as a result of higher average unit prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales. During 2009, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments decreased by 3.9% versus an estimated industry decline of 8.6%. Gross profit was $1.906 billion, or 51.7% of sales excluding excise taxes in 2009, compared to $1.770 billion, or 50.7% of net sales excluding excise taxes in 2008. The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales and the absence of free product promotions in 2009, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, higher federal excise taxes, higher manufacturing costs and higher pension costs.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $10 million, or 2.8% in 2009 to $365 million compared to 2008, which included an $18 million charge related to the separation from Loews. 2009 results included a $8 million increase in pension costs and a $18 million increase in legal expenses due primarily to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in marketing costs.
Investment income decreased $15 million in 2009, compared to 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments.
Interest expense increased $26 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 37.6% in 2009 compared to 38.2% in 2008, which decreased income tax expense by $9 million. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the separation from Loews on the availability of the manufacturer's deduction for the pre-separation period and the non-deductibility of certain separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates.
Net income in 2009 was $948 million, or $5.76 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $887 million, or $5.15 per share (basic and diluted) in 2008. These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in 2009 than in 2008 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in August 2008, May 2009 and July 2009. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.25.
