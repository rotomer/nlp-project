"We are delighted to report a solid first quarter in which revenue, excluding excise tax, increased by 20%, operating income increased by 30%, and Lorillards market share grew, stated Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  We have achieved these results despite challenging market conditions, which is testament to our strong brands and continual focus on optimizing profitability and execution.  However, we would caution that, because of the significant disruptions our industry sustained last year combined with the effects of increases this year in wholesale inventories at certain of our customers, making comparisons to 2009 on a quarterly basis, particularly the first and second quarters, may lead to inappropriate conclusions and expectations about unit volume trends.  Longer term trends will be better judged by comparing the first half of 2010 to the first half of 2009. We are encouraged that the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong, but we would not expect the same sequential improvement over last year in our second fiscal quarter.  We continue to remain focused on our long term strategic objective of balancing Newports market share performance and profitability and creating shareholder value.

First Quarter 2010 Results
Net sales were $1.360 billion in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $917 million in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of $443 million.  $287 million of that increase was the result of the April 1, 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes.  Net sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter of 2010 increased $156 million, or 20.3% from the first quarter of 2009 as the result of higher average prices, higher net unit sales volume and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales.  Gross profit was $478 million in the first quarter of 2010, or 51.8% of net sales excluding excise taxes compared to $383 million, or 49.9% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first quarter of 2009.  The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the first quarter of 2010 of 8.863 billion units increased 12.1% compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Total domestic industry wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 2.4% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments increased 12.7% for the same period.  This increase in domestic wholesale shipments in the first quarter of 2010 reflects the unusually low unit volume in 2009 resulting from tax-driven trade purchasing patterns in anticipation of the increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes on April 1, 2009.  In addition to this effect, increases in wholesale inventory levels during the first quarter of 2010 contributed to this increase in unit volume as compared to last year.  Newports domestic wholesale shipments increased 9.8%, while Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 48.7% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillards proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the first quarter of 2010 by 0.75 share points to 10.90% from 10.15% in the first quarter of 2009.  See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million, or 7.9% in the first quarter of 2010 to $96 million compared to the first quarter of 2009. The increase in the first quarter of 2010 is primarily due to a $5 million increase in compensation expenses, a $1 million increase in health care costs and a $1 million increase in legal expenses due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle progeny cases.
Interest expense increased $10 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009 and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 37.8% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 37.7% in the first quarter of 2009.   The increase is primarily due to the $2 million impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted during the first quarter of 2010, partially offset by a statutory increase in the manufacturers deduction.
Net income in the first quarter of 2010 was $232 million, or $1.50 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $184 million, or $1.09 per share (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2009.  These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2010 than in the first quarter of 2009 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in May 2009, July 2009 and February 2010.  The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.12.
