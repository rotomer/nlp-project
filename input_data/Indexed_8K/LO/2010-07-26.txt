GREENSBORO, NC, July 26, 2010Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE:LO) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 
Highlights
 
Because of the unusual wholesale shipment patterns in 2009 which distort quarter over quarter comparisons in the first two quarters of 2010, it may be useful for investors to also compare the first six months of 2010 with the same period in 2009 in order to give appropriate context to the 2010 second quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We are extremely pleased with our performance for the second quarter of this year when considering the unique circumstances that affected the industry during the second quarter of last year, stated Martin Orlowsky, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  On a relative basis, Lorillard outperformed the industry in each of the first two quarters of this year and achieved record retail market shares for the total brand portfolio and specifically, Newport.  Newport increased its penetration of the total domestic market as well as the menthol category.  While there continue to be pressures exerted on the industry as a consequence of state excise tax increases, continued smoking restrictions, and the nature of the economy, we will continue to apply the same disciplined strategies to operating and improving our business as we have in the past, and remain focused on our long term strategic objectives.
Second Quarter 2010 Results
Net sales were $1.520 billion in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $1.519 billion in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of $1 million.  Net sales excluding excise taxes in the second quarter of 2010 increased $5 million, or 0.5% from the second quarter of 2009 as the result of higher average prices, partially offset by lower net unit sales volume and higher sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales.  Gross profit was $542 million in the second quarter of 2010, or 52.2% of net sales excluding excise taxes compared to $552 million, or 53.4% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the second quarter of 2009.  The decrease in gross profit reflects the higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees.

Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the second quarter of 2010 of 9.785 billion units decreased 0.9% compared to the second quarter of 2009.  Total domestic industry wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 7.1% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments decreased 0.6% for the same period.  The decrease in Industry and Lorillard volumes in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2009 was in part the result of high volumes of wholesale inventory replenishment in the second quarter of 2009 due to lower wholesale inventories immediately prior to the federal excise tax increase on April 1, 2009.  Newports domestic wholesale shipments decreased 3.4%, while Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 26.5% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillards proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the second quarter of 2010 by 0.5 share points to 10.9% from 10.4% in the second quarter of 2009.  See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs were $97 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $96 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Interest expense increased $26 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009 and reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 37.1% in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009. 
Net income in the second quarter of 2010 was $263 million, or $1.73 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $286 million, or $1.71 per share (basic and diluted) in the second quarter of 2009.  These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2010 than in the second quarter of 2009 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in May 2009, July 2009 and February 2010.  The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.16.
See following table for additional information regarding the impact of excise taxes on reported results:

First Half 2010 Results
Net sales were $2.879 billion in the first half of 2010, compared to $2.436 billion in the first half of 2009, an increase of $443 million.  $287 million of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes.  Net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2010 increased $159 million, or 8.8% from the first half of 2009 as the result of higher average unit prices, higher net unit sales volume and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales.   During the first half of 2010, Lorillards domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by 5.3% versus an estimated industry decline of 4.9%.  Gross profit was $1.019 billion, or 52.0% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2010, compared to $937 million, or 52.0% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first half of 2009.  The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher federal excise taxes and higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees.  See attached tables for wholesale and selected retail share data comparing first six months of 2010 and 2009.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $6 million, or 3.2% in the first half of 2010 to $192 million compared to the first half of 2009.  The increase in the first half of 2010 is primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses.
Interest expense increased $35 million in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009 and reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 37.4% in the first half of 2010 and 2009.
Net income in the first half of 2010 was $495 million, or $3.23 per share basic and $3.22 per share diluted, compared to $470 million, or $2.80 per share (basic and diluted) in the first half of 2009.  These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first half of 2010 than in the first half of 2009 resulting from the share repurchase programs authorized in May 2009, July 2009 and February 2010.  The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.28.
