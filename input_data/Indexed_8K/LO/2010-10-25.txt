GREENSBORO, NC, October 25, 2010  Lorillard, Inc.  (NYSE:LO) announced today that 2010 third quarter net earnings rose 16.6% percent to $274 million and diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $1.81.  This compared to $235 million or $1.44 per diluted share reported for the third quarter of 2009.  Net sales increased $148 million, or 10.4%, to a record level of $1.567 billion for the third quarter of 2010, compared to $1.419 billion for the third quarter of 2009.
Third quarter operating income increased $73 million, or 18.6%, from the same quarter of 2009 also to a record level of $465 million.  These improved results were driven by a 5.8% increase in total unit volume and higher average net selling prices.
The 26% increase in earnings per diluted share for the third quarter includes the benefit of the Companys share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.14, or 9.7 percentage points, to the increase in earnings per share.
Additional highlights include:
We are delighted to report an outstanding third quarter of 2010 as Lorillard and its flagship brand, Newport, continue to outperform the industry.  Our total portfolio of brands has once again posted record retail market share numbers for the quarter, stated Murray S. Kessler, the new President and Chief Executive Officer of Lorillard.  I had always admired Lorillard as an outsider and, as a result, had high expectations walking in the door.  Those expectations have been significantly exceeded as I have gotten to know the business and the talented people that work at the Company.  Its a tribute to my predecessor, Marty Orlowsky.  He has much to be proud of.

Results
Net sales increased $591 m
illion to $4.446 billion in the first nine months of 2010, compared to $3.855 billion in the first nine months of 2009, an increase of 15.3%.  
About half
,
o
r
 
$287 million
,
of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes o
n cigarettes.  Net sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2010 increased $279 million, or 10.1% from the first nine months of 2009 as the result of higher average unit prices, higher net unit sales volume and lower sales promotion costs
a
ccounted for as a reduction in net sales.

During the first nine months of 2010, Lorillard
s domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by
5.5
% versus an estimated industry decline
 
of
3.5
%.  Gross profit was $1.585 billion, or 52.3% of net
sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2010, compared to $1.425 billion, or 51.7% of net sales excluding excise taxes in the first nine months of 2009.  
Excise taxes
have
been excluded f
rom
the
nine
months comparison due to the
April 1, 2
009
increase in the federal excise tax.  
The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Adm
inistration
user
fees.  See attached tables for wholesale and selected retail share data comparing first nine months of 2010 and 2009.

% in the
first nine months
 
of 2010
to
$
293

n
compared to
the

as a result of higher legal and administrative costs incurred in the current year.

Net income in the first nine months of 2010 was $770 million, or $5.04 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $706 million, or $4.24 per share (basic and diluted) in the first nine months of 2009.  These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in the first nine months of 2010 than in the first nine months of 2009 resulting from share repurchase programs. The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.42.
