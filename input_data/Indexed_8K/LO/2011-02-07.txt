Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lorillard continued to fire on all cylinders during the fourth quarter leading to record annual results in net sales, net earnings, earnings per share and retail market share. said Murray S. Kessler, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Based on our current strategic review process, which is well under way, I remain confident in the Companys future and its ability to deliver a double digit shareholder return over the long-term.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
Net sales increased $108 million to $1.486 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $1.378 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 7.8%.  The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume, higher average prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction of sales.  Gross profit was $538 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, or 36.2% of net sales, compared to $481 million, or 34.9% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the fourth quarter of 2010 of 9.456 billion units increased 4.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  Total industry domestic wholesale shipments (which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions) decreased an estimated 4.7% for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments increased 4.6% for the same period.  Newports domestic wholesale shipments increased 2.2%, while Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 25.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.  The Company launched Newport Non-Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010, which significantly contributed to the increase in Newport domestic wholesale shipments during the quarter, slightly offset by the effect of trade inventory fluctuations as compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.
Based on Lorillards proprietary retail shipment data, Newport continued to increase its domestic retail market share during the fourth quarter of 2010 by 0.8 share points to 11.2%, an all-time high, from 10.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Newport Non-Menthol accounted for 0.5 share points of this increase.  See attached table for selected retail share data.
 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $22 million to $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily as a result of higher legal and compensation costs.

Interest expense increased $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 36.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 37.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $259 million, or $1.74 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $242 million, or $1.52 per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The 14.5% increase in earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter includes the benefit of the Companys share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.11, or 7.2 percentage points, to the increase in earnings per share.
Lorillards reported results are impacted by excise taxes which are included in the Companys cost of sales.  The following table provides additional information regarding the impact of excise taxes on reported results:
2010 Results
Net sales increased $699 million to a record $5.932 billion in 2010, compared to $5.233 billion in 2009, an increase of 13.4%.  $287 million of that increase was the result of the April 2009 increase in federal excise taxes on cigarettes.  Net sales excluding excise taxes in 2010 increased $367 million, or 10.0%, from 2009 as the result of higher net unit sales volume, higher average unit prices and lower sales promotion costs accounted for as a reduction in net sales.
Gross profit was $2.123 billion, or 52.4% of net sales excluding excise taxes in 2010, compared to $1.906 billion, or 51.7% of net sales excluding excise taxes in 2009.  Excise taxes have been excluded from this annual comparison due to the April 1, 2009 increase in the federal excise tax.  The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.  See attached tables for wholesale and selected retail share data comparing 2010 and 2009.
During 2010, Lorillard's domestic wholesale unit shipments increased by 5.3% versus an estimated industry decline of 3.8%. Newport's domestic wholesale shipments increased 2.5%, while Maverick's domestic wholesale shipments increased 31.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.

Selling, general and administrative costs increased $33 million, or 9.0%, in 2010 to $398 million compared to 2009 as a result of higher legal and compensation costs incurred in the current year.
Interest expense increased $67 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 37.1 % in 2010 compared to 37.6% in 2009.
Net income in 2010 was $1.029 billion, or $6.78 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $948 million, or $5.76 per share (basic and diluted) in 2009.  These results reflect the impact of the aforementioned factors and the effect on earnings per share of a lower average number of shares outstanding in 2010 than in 2009 resulting from share repurchase programs.  The impact of the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding increased earnings per share by $0.53 compared to 2009.
