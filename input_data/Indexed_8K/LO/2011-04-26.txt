Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
In the first quarter, Lorillard once again delivered industry leading financial results on virtually every measure that matters, said Murray S. Kessler, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Its a testament to our flagship Newport brand which continues to organically grow volume and market share, despite challenging external conditions.
First Quarter 2011 Results
Net sales increased $175 million to $1.535 billion in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $1.360 billion in the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 12.9%.  The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume and higher average prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs primarily driven by the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol.  Gross profit was $543 million in the first quarter of 2011, or 35.4% of net sales, compared to $478 million, or 35.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2010.  The increase in gross profit reflects an increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the first quarter of 2011, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 9.5% compared to the first quarter of 2010 to 9.708 billion units.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments, which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 9.4% for the same period.  Domestic wholesale shipments for Newport, the Companys flagship brand, increased 8.0%, while domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick, the Companys leading discount brand, increased 22.7% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010.  Newport Non-Menthol, the first significant line extension for Newport in the last decade, was successfully launched in the fourth quarter of 2010 and significantly contributed to the increase in Newport domestic wholesale shipments during the first quarter.  Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 3.4% for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010.  The first quarter of 2011 included one additional shipping day versus a year ago.  Adjusting for the additional day and modest changes in wholesale inventory patterns, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased an estimated 8.3% for the first quarter of 2011.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.

Based on Lorillards proprietary retail shipment data, Lorillards domestic retail market share made strong gains in the first quarter of 2011, increasing 1.5 percentage points to a market share of 14.1%.  Newports domestic retail market share reached 12.0% during the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 1.1 share points compared to the first quarter of 2010.  Newport Non-Menthols market share was .7 share points, significantly contributing to Newports overall share increase for the quarter.  See attached table for selected retail share data.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $26 million to $122 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation.  In addition, selling, general and administrative costs include higher administrative costs incurred in support of the Companys position and industry reports to the FDA regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes and advertising costs related to the support of Newport Non-Menthol.
Interest expense increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to additional interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 37.1% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 37.8% in the first quarter of 2010.  The decrease is primarily due to an unfavorable adjustment in the first quarter of 2010 from the impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010.
Net income in the first quarter of 2011 was $248 million, or $1.71 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $232 million, or $1.50 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2010.  The 14% increase in earnings per diluted share for the first quarter includes the benefit of the Companys share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.11, or 7.3 percentage points, to the increase in earnings per share.
Additional News
On February 17, 2011, Lorillard, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend on its common stock to $1.30 per share.  The dividend was payable on March 11, 2011 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2011.
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of $289 million under the $1 billion repurchase program announced on August 20, 2010. As of March 31, 2011, the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the program was $335 million.
In April 2011, the Company paid $1.003 billion under the State Settlement Agreements, primarily based on 2010 volume.  Included in this amount was $107 million deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by the Company and the other Original Participating Manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of market share to non-participating manufacturers.
