Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lorillard delivered strong second quarter results, despite the difficult macro-economic conditions. These results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength of our brands and our organization, said Murray S. Kessler, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  We are particularly pleased with the impact of our new strategic growth initiatives, highlighted by the successful introduction of Newport Non-Menthol.
Second Quarter 2011 Results
Net sales increased $172 million to $1.692 billion in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $1.520 billion in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 11.3%.  The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume and higher average prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs primarily driven by the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol.
Gross profit was $599 million in the second quarter of 2011, or 35.4% of net sales, compared to $542 million, or 35.7% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2010.  The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the second quarter of 2011, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 9.9% compared to the second quarter of 2010 to 10.8 billion units.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments, which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 10.4% for the same period.  Domestic wholesale shipments for Newport, the Companys flagship brand, increased 9.6%, while domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick, the Companys leading discount brand, increased 21.2% in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010.  Shipments of Newport Non-Menthol, the most recent Newport line extension launched in the fourth quarter of 2010, represented the bulk of the increase in Newport domestic wholesale shipments during the second quarter.  Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 1.3% for the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010.  Adjusting for changes in wholesale inventory patterns, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased an estimated 8.1% for the second quarter of 2011.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.

Based on Lorillards proprietary retail shipment data (Excel), which measures shipments from wholesale to retail, Lorillards domestic retail market share once again posted gains in the second quarter of 2011, increasing 1.4 share points to a market share of 14.2%.  Newports domestic retail market share reached 12.0% during the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 1.1 share points compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $15 million to $112 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation.  In addition, certain other selling, general and administrative costs increased due to higher marketing and other costs related to the Companys strategic initiatives, including market research and advertising support of Newport Non-Menthol.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 36.6% in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 37.1% in the second quarter of 2010.  The decrease is primarily due to state tax law changes enacted during the second quarter of 2011 and the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters.
Net income in the second quarter of 2011 was $291 million, or $2.05 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $263 million, or $1.73 per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2010.  The 18.5% increase in earnings per diluted share for the second quarter includes the benefit of the Companys share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.14, or 8.0 percentage points, to the increase in earnings per share.
First Half 2011 Results
Net sales were $3.227 billion in the first half of 2011, compared to $2.879 billion in the first half of 2010, an increase of 12.1%.  The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume and higher average prices, partially offset by higher sales promotion costs primarily driven by the introduction of Newport Non-Menthol.
Gross profit was $1.142 billion in the first half of 2011, or 35.4% of net sales, compared to $1.019 billion, or 35.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2010.  The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the first half of 2011, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 9.7% compared to the first half of 2010 to 20.5 billion units.  Lorillards domestic wholesale shipments, which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 9.9% for the same period.  Domestic wholesale shipments for Newport, the Companys flagship brand, increased 8.9%, while domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick increased 21.9% in first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010.  Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 2.3% for the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010.  See attached table for details of Lorillards wholesale shipments.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $42 million, or 21.9% in the first half of 2011 to $234 million compared to the first half of 2010.  The increase in the first half of 2011 is primarily a result of higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation.  In addition, certain other selling, general and administrative costs increased due to higher administrative costs incurred in support of strategic initiatives, including market research and advertising costs related to the support of Newport Non-Menthol, as well as costs incurred in support of the Companys position and industry reports to the FDA regarding the use of Menthol in cigarettes.
Interest expense increased $19 million in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010 and reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillards effective income tax rate was 36.8% in the first half of 2011 compared to 37.4% in the first half of 2010.  The decrease is primarily due to an unfavorable adjustment in the first quarter of 2010 from the impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010, as well as state tax law changes enacted during the second quarter of 2011 and the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters.
Net income in the first half of 2011 was $539 million, or $3.75 per share basic and diluted, compared to $495 million, or $3.23 per share basic and $3.22 per share diluted in the first half of 2010.  The 16.5% increase in earnings per diluted share for the first half of 2011 includes the benefit of the Companys share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.24, or 7.5 percentage points, to the increase in earnings per share.
