Covenants of the Company and the Guarantor
          (a) The Company (i) will prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and file the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations within the time period prescribed by such Rule; (ii) will not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, which filing is not consented to by the Representatives after reasonable notice thereof (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (iii) will advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus has been filed and will furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; (iv) will prepare the Final Term Sheet, substantially in the form of Schedule III hereto and approved by the Representatives and file the Final Term Sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations within the time period prescribed by such Rule; (v) will advise the Representatives promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission or any state or other regulatory body of any stop order or any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, suspending or preventing the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or suspending the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, of receipt by the Company from the Commission of any notice of objection to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or for additional information; and (vi) will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other such order or any such notice of objection and, if a stop order or other such order is issued or any such notice of objection is received, to obtain as soon as possible the lifting or withdrawal thereof.
          (b) The Company will prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon the request of the Representatives, any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of the Representatives, may be necessary or advisable in connection with the offering of the Notes.
          (c) The Company will furnish to each of the Representatives and to counsel for the Underwriters such number of conformed copies of the Registration Statement, as originally filed and each amendment thereto (excluding exhibits other than this Agreement), any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet and any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to any of such documents (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request.
          (d) During the period in which the Prospectus relating to the Notes (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Rules and Regulations) is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company will comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act and by the Rules and Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as is necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated
 
by the provisions of this Agreement and by the Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will, subject to Section 4(a) hereof, amend the Registration Statement, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or file any document (in each case, at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and will furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many written and electronic copies of any such amendment or supplement as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request.
          (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and the Underwriters an earnings statement satisfying the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations.

It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 4(f) or Sections 7 and 9 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters and any advertising expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Notes. If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated by reason of acts of the Company or changes in circumstances of the Company pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to perform any agreement on its part to be performed or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled or if the Underwriters decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with any investigation or preparation
 
made by them in respect of the marketing of the Notes or in contemplation of the performance by them of their obligations hereunder.
          (g) Until completion of the distribution of the Notes, the Company will timely file all reports, documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
          (h) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes as set forth in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.
          (i) Until seven days following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities that are substantially similar to the Notes (including, without limitation, with respect to the maturity, currency, interest rate and other material terms of the Notes).
          (j) The Company will pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time period required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Rules and Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Rules and Regulations.
          (k) If required by Rule 430B(h) of the Rules and Regulations, the Company will prepare a prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and file such prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than may be required by such Rule; and the Company will make no further amendment or supplement to such prospectus that will be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
          (l) The Company and the Guarantor will cooperate with the Underwriters and with counsel to the Underwriters in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale by the Underwriters and by dealers under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will file such consents to service of process or other documents necessary or appropriate in order to effect such qualification and to permit the continuance of sales and dealings in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Notes; that in no event will the Company or the Guarantor be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to service of process in suits, other than for actions or proceedings arising out of the offering or sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided, however,
          (m) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.
          (n) The Company will comply with all agreements set forth in the representation letters of the Company to DTC relating to the acceptance of the Notes for "book-entry" transfer through the facilities of DTC.

Free Writing Prospectuses
          (a) The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that (i) the Company has not made, and will not, make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus without the prior consent of the Representatives (which consent being deemed to have been given with respect to (A) the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof and (B) any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus identified on Schedule II hereto); (ii) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conformed or will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations on the date of first use, and the Company has complied with any filing requirements applicable to such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations; (iii) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not, as of its issue date and through the time the Notes are delivered pursuant to Section 3 hereof, include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; and (iv) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the information contained in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, did not, as of the Applicable Time, does not, as of the date hereof, and will not, as of the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          (b) Each Underwriter represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and each other Underwriter that it has not made, and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations) required to be filed with the Commission, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives.
          (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.

provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company and the Guarantor may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantor in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; , , that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of such Underwriter, expressly for use therein (which information is specified in Section 12 hereof).

          (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , , that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action will be brought against any

however
 
indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company and the Guarantor under Section 7(a) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company and the Guarantor in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company and the Guarantor have failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company and the Guarantor. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (A) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative
 
fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 7(c) above).
          (e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 7, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
          8. . (a) If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed
Substitution of Underwriters
 
but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 7 of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 8.
          (b) If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order that the Company may effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of the Representatives, may thereby be made necessary.
          (c) Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.
          9. . (a) Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any of the events described in Sections 6(l) and 6(m) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (iii) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(f) and 7 hereof.
Termination
          (b) Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 11 of this Agreement in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, will be immediately confirmed in writing.
          10. . The agreements contained in Section 7 of this Agreement and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in Sections 1 and 4 of this Agreement will survive the delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters hereunder and will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

          11. . Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, (a) whenever notice is required by the provisions of this Agreement to be given to the Company and the Guarantor, such notice will be in writing by mail, telex or facsimile transmission addressed to the

          13. . The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the offering of the Notes that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions. The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 1.
 
     (A) . By amending Section 101 to insert the following definitions in their entirety in the appropriate alphabetical order as follows:
Definitions
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:

If an Event of Default with respect to any particular series of Securities occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5)), then and in every such case either the Trustee for the Securities of such series or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the entire principal amount (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to such Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration of acceleration such principal or such lesser amount, as the case may be, together with accrued interest and all other amounts owing hereunder, shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.
If any Event of Default specified in Section 501(4), 501(5), 501(7) or 501(8) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount (or, if the Securities of any series then outstanding are (i) OID Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in the terms of that series or (ii) Indexed Securities, the amount determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities) and accrued interest on all Securities of each series then Outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders of each series of Securities to receive additional interest on the Securities of that particular series equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Securities of such series. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the Securities of that particular series. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding Securities from and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter
 
(or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of this paragraph will not affect the rights of Holders in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
In order to elect to pay the additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 120 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation set forth in Section 704 in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must notify all Holders of each series of Securities, the Trustee for the Securities of such series and the Paying Agent for the Securities of such series of such election by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as provided below on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. Upon the Company's failure to deliver such Officers' Certificate or pay the additional interest specified in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
If the Company elects to pay additional interest, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to that effect stating that (i) the amount of such additional interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such additional interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no additional interest is payable. If the Company has paid additional interest directly to the Persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee for the Securities of any series as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and such Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (1) the Company has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Section 311(c)):
     (A) all overdue interest, if any, on all Securities of that series;
     (B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon from the date such principal became due at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities), to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable;
 
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities' Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities); and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by such Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607;
and
     (2) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     (C) . By replacing Section 1007(b) of the Original Indenture in its entirety as follows:
Limitation on Liens
(b) The Company and/or any Subsidiary may create, assume or incur, or suffer to be created, assumed or incurred, liens which would otherwise be prohibited by Subsection (a) of this Section 1007, provided that the indebtedness secured thereby, plus the aggregate value of the Sale and Leaseback Transactions permitted by the provisions of Subsection (b) of Section 1008, does not at the time exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

This 2016 Senior Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such 2016 Senior Notes issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated August 4, 2011, by and among the Company, Lorillard, Inc., as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the ""), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the 2016 Senior Notes and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of 2016 Senior Notes and of the Company, and the terms upon which the 2016 Senior Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. Each holder of a 2016 Senior Note, by acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by the terms of this 2016 Senior Note and the within referenced Indenture.
2016 Senior Notes
Indenture
Guarantee
     The 2016 Senior Notes have the benefit of the unconditional guarantee by the Guarantor to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the 2016 Senior Notes, according to the terms of and as more fully described in the Indenture and the related Guarantee Agreement executed by the Guarantor on the date hereof.
Defeasance
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the 2016 Senior Notes of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
Events of Default
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the 2016 Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes then Outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
     Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation to provide certain reports and information as set forth in Section 704 of the Indenture will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders to receive additional interest on the 2016 Senior Notes equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the 2016 Senior Notes. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding 2016 Senior Notes from and including
 
the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the 2016 Senior Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in the paragraph above. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the 2016 Senior Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in paragraph above.
Amendments
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the 2016 Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Guarantor with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 2016 Senior Notes of each series of 2016 Senior Notes then Outstanding affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the 2016 Senior Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series.

     This Note is one of a series of the Senior Notes designated therein as 7.000% Notes due August 4, 2041 (the ""). This 2041 Senior Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such 2041 Senior Notes issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated August 4, 2011, by and among the Company, Lorillard, Inc., as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the ""), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the 2041 Senior Notes and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of 2041 Senior Notes and of the Company, and the terms upon which the 2041 Senior Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. Each holder of a 2041 Senior Note, by acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by the terms of this 2041 Senior Note and the within referenced Indenture.
2041 Senior Notes
Indenture
Guarantee
     The 2041 Senior Notes have the benefit of the unconditional guarantee by the Guarantor to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the 2041 Senior Notes, according to the terms of and as more fully described in the Indenture and the related Guarantee Agreement executed by the Guarantor on the date hereof.
Defeasance
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the 2041 Senior Notes of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
Events of Default
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the 2041 Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the 2041 Senior Notes then Outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the 2041 Senior Notes due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
     Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, to the extent elected by the Company, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation to provide certain reports and information as set forth in Section 704 of the Indenture will, for the first 120 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right for Holders to receive additional interest on the 2041 Senior Notes equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the 2041 Senior Notes. If the Company so elects, such additional interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated Interest Payment Dates on the 2041 Senior Notes. The additional interest will accrue on all outstanding 2041 Senior Notes from and includ-
 
ing the date on which such Event of Default first occurs to, but not including, the 120th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture). On such 120th day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default relating to such obligation is not cured or waived by Holders as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture prior to such 120th day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the 2041 Senior Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in the paragraph above. In the event the Company does not elect to pay the additional interest upon such Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the 2041 Senior Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in paragraph above.
Amendments
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the 2041 Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Guarantor with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 2041 Senior Notes of each series of 2041 Senior Notes then Outstanding affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the 2041 Senior Notes of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the 2041 Senior Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this 2041 Senior Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this 2041Senior Note and of any 2041 Senior Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this 2041 Senior Note.
