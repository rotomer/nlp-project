Exhibit 99.1
GREENSBORO, NC, October 24, 2011  Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE: LO) announced today results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
Third Quarter 2011 Highlights
"Lorillard fundamentals remained extremely strong in the third quarter, although as we expected shipments were negatively affected by changes in wholesale inventory patterns versus last year. Wholesale shipments of Lorillard products to retail, which are unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory, increased over 8% versus year ago. And, the Company achieved significant market share gains in all market categories and all sales regions," said Murray S. Kessler, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Continued strong fundamentals combined with normalized wholesale inventories bode well for a strong fourth quarter finish to an already outstanding 2011."
Third Quarter 2011 Results
Net sales increased $55 million to $1.622 billion in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $1.567 billion in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of 3.5%. The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume and higher average prices, partially offset by introductory promotional pricing of Newport Non-Menthol.
Gross profit was $563 million in the third quarter of 2011, or 34.7% of net sales, compared to $566 million, or 36.1% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in gross profit reflects higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees, partially offset by the increase in net sales.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the third quarter of 2011, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 2.8% compared to the third quarter of 2010 to 10.3 billion units. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments, which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, also increased 2.8% for the same period. Domestic wholesale shipments for Newport, the Company's flagship brand, increased 2.5%, while domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick, the Company's leading discount brand, increased 7.0% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 6.4% for the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Changes in wholesale inventory patterns are estimated to have negatively impacted year ago comparisons by approximately 3 percentage points for the industry and approximately 4 percentage points for Lorillard. Adjusting for this effect, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments increased approximately 7% for the third quarter of 2011. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
 
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data ("Excel"), which measures shipments from wholesale to retail and is unaffected by changes in wholesale inventory patterns, Lorillard shipments grew over 8% versus year ago. Lorillard's domestic retail market share once again posted gains in the third quarter of 2011, increasing 1.3 share points to a market share of 14.2%. Newport's domestic retail market share reached 11.9% during the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 1.1 share points compared to the third quarter of 2010. The Company's successful launch of Newport Non-Menthol, geographic expansion initiatives on Newport Menthol and continued double digit retail shipment growth on Maverick accounted for the increase in volume and market share growth.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $7 million to $108 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of higher compensation costs, higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation and higher marketing and other costs related to the Company's strategic initiatives, including market research and advertising support of Newport Non-Menthol.
Interest expense increased $5 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010 and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 36.7% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 37.3% in the third quarter of 2010. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in the Company's manufacturers' deduction in 2011.
Net income in the third quarter of 2011 was $267 million, or $1.94 per share (basic and diluted), compared to $274 million, or $1.82 per share (basic) and $1.81 per share (diluted), in the third quarter of 2010. The 7.2% increase in earnings per diluted share for the third quarter includes the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.18 to the increase in earnings per share.
First Nine Months 2011 Results
Net sales were $4.849 billion in the first nine months of 2011, compared to $4.446 billion in the first nine months of 2010, an increase of 9.1%. The increase resulted from higher unit sales volume and higher average prices, partially offset by introductory promotional pricing of Newport Non-Menthol.
Gross profit was $1.705 billion in the first nine months of 2011, or 35.2% of net sales, compared to $1.585 billion, or 35.7% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2010. The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Total Lorillard wholesale shipment volume for the first nine months of 2011, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 7.3% compared to the first nine months of 2010 to 30.7 billion units. Lorillard's domestic wholesale shipments, which exclude Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, increased 7.4% for the same period. Domestic wholesale shipments for Newport, the Company's flagship brand, increased 6.7%, while domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick increased 16.2% in first nine months of 2011 compared to the first nine months of 2010. Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 3.7% for the first nine months of 2011 compared to the first nine months of 2010. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $49 million, or 16.7% in the first nine months of 2011 to $342 million compared to the first nine months of 2010. The increase in the first nine months of 2011 is primarily a result of higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation. In addition, certain other selling, general and administrative costs increased due to higher compensation costs and higher administrative costs incurred in support of strategic initiatives, including market research and advertising costs related to the support of Newport Non-Menthol, as well as costs incurred in support of the Company's position and industry reports to the FDA regarding the use of Menthol in cigarettes.
Interest expense increased $24 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the first nine months of 2010 and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 36.8% in the first nine months of 2011 compared to 37.4% in the first nine months of 2010. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in the Company's manufacturers' deduction in 2011 and an unfavorable adjustment in the first quarter of 2010 from the impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted in that same quarter, as well as state tax law changes enacted during the second quarter of 2011 and the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters.
 
Net income in the first nine months of 2011 was $806 million, or $5.70 per share (basic) and $5.69 per share (diluted), compared to $770 million, or $5.04 per share (basic and diluted) in the first nine months of 2010. The 12.9% increase in earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of 2011 includes the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program which resulted in lower outstanding shares, and contributed $0.43 to the increase in earnings per share.
