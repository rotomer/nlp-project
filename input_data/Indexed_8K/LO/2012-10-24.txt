Exhibit 99.1
 
GREENSBORO, NC, October 24, 2012  Lorillard, Inc. (NYSE: LO) announced today its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2012.
Third Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Lorillard once again strengthened its position in the U.S. cigarette market during the third quarter as it grew market share, sales, margins and average net pricing, all of which translated to strong EPS growth over last year. Notably, the Company expanded its share leadership position in the menthol cigarette segment during the quarter despite intense competitive menthol promotional and new product activity demonstrating the remarkable strength of its flagship brand, Newport. The Company also continued to execute against its strategic plan as it began to invest in advertising, distribution and merchandising on blu eCigs, the leading e-cigarette brand acquired earlier this year," said Murray S. Kessler, Chairman, CEO and President. "While we are pleased with third quarter results, the competitive environment, both in terms of pricing and product introductions, has clearly heated up through the year and is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. Therefore, our marketing plans for the immediate future are geared toward protecting consumer loyalty which is fundamental for continued profitable growth. At the same time, the Company will ramp up investment behind blu eCigs as it further penetrates national retail distribution. The Company expects to continue to deliver a double digit total shareholder return, as measured by EPS and the dividend yield, while it makes these strategic investments."
 
 
Third Quarter 2012 Results
Net sales increased $39 million to $1.661 billion in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $1.622 billion in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 2.4%. The increase resulted primarily from higher average cigarette selling prices, partially offset by lower cigarette unit sales volume. Sales of blu eCigs contributed $14 million to Lorillard's total net sales for the quarter.
Total Lorillard wholesale cigarette unit volume, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, decreased 2.1% for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Domestic wholesale cigarette unit volume, which excludes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions also decreased 2.1% for the third quarter of 2012, compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Changes in wholesale inventory patterns are estimated to have positively impacted year ago comparisons by approximately 160 million units. This was less than expected as wholesalers entered the third quarter with fewer units than year ago but further reduced inventory levels during the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, the third quarter of 2012 contained one fewer shipping day (63) than the third quarter of 2011 (64) which had a 1.6% negative effect on volume. Adjusting for both the positive impact of the relative change in wholesale inventory patterns and the negative impact of one fewer shipping day in the third quarter of 2012, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments were down 2.0% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. These results compare favorably to the total cigarette industry which had domestic wholesale shipments decrease an estimated 2.7% for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarter will contain one more shipping day (63) than the fourth quarter of 2011 (62). See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Both total wholesale unit volume and domestic wholesale unit volume for Newport, the Company's flagship brand, decreased 2.3% for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick, the Company's leading discount brand, increased 1.1% for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data ("EXCEL"), which measures shipments from wholesale to retail, Lorillard gained domestic retail market share in the third quarter of 2012 versus year ago with an increase of 0.2 share points to 14.4%. Newport's domestic retail market share increased 0.2 share points to 12.1% versus the third quarter of 2011. Lorillard's leading domestic retail share of the menthol market was further strengthened during the third quarter of 2012 to 39.6%, an increase of 0.5 share points compared to the third quarter of 2011. Likewise, Newport's share of the menthol market also increased in the quarter, up 0.3 share points to 36.4%. Gains in market share were largely attributable to unit volume outperformance of Newport Menthol versus the category in our core markets despite the heightened level of competitive activity, and to a lesser extent, continued growth of Maverick.
Gross profit was $602 million in the third quarter of 2012, or 36.2% of net sales, compared to $563 million, or 34.7% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in gross profit and 150 basis point increase in gross margin reflect the increase in net sales and lower costs for the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers, partially offset by higher costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, higher raw material input costs (primarily tobacco and other direct costs) and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $14 million to $122 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 due to $5 million in higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation and $9 million of blu eCigs' marketing and administrative costs associated with the brand's national retail roll-out.
Interest expense increased $4 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 36.2% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 36.7% in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to the settlement of certain state tax matters.
Adjusted net income in the third quarter of 2012 was $283 million, or $2.17 per share (diluted), compared to $267 million, or $1.94 per share (diluted), in the third quarter of 2011, representing an 11.9% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Reported net income in the third quarter of 2012 was $283 million, or $2.16 per share (diluted). blu eCigs incurred a $4 million adjusted operating loss for the quarter, primarily due to the marketing investment associated with the brand's national retail roll-out.
 
 
First Nine Months 2012 Results
Net sales increased 1.4% to $4.919 billion in the first nine months of 2012, compared to $4.849 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The increase resulted from higher average cigarette selling prices, partially offset by lower cigarette unit sales volume. Post acquisition, sales of blu eCigs contributed $21 million to Lorillard's total net sales for the first nine months of 2012.
Total Lorillard wholesale cigarette unit volume, which includes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, decreased 2.0% for the first nine months of 2012 compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Domestic wholesale cigarette unit volume, which excludes Puerto Rico and U.S. Possessions, decreased 1.9% for the first nine months of 2012, compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Changes in wholesale inventory patterns are estimated to have negatively impacted year ago comparisons during the first nine months by approximately 210 million units. Additionally, the first nine months of 2012 contained one fewer shipping day (191) than the first nine months of 2011 (192), which will be recovered in the fourth quarter of this year. Adjusting for both the impact of changes in wholesale inventory patterns and one fewer shipping day in the first nine months of 2012, Lorillard domestic wholesale shipments decreased 0.7% compared to the first nine months of 2011. Total cigarette industry domestic wholesale shipments decreased an estimated 2.7% for the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011. See attached table for details of Lorillard's wholesale shipments.
Both total wholesale unit volume and domestic wholesale unit volume for Newport, the Company's flagship brand, decreased 2.7% for the first nine months of 2012 compared to the corresponding period of 2011. Changes in wholesale inventory patterns are estimated to have negatively impacted year ago comparisons by approximately 190 million units. Adjusting for this effect and one fewer shipping day in the first nine months of 2012, Newport domestic wholesale shipments were down 1.5%. Domestic wholesale shipments for Maverick, the Company's leading discount brand, increased 4.9% for the first nine months of 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011.
Based on Lorillard's proprietary retail shipment data ("EXCEL"), which measures shipments from wholesale to retail and is unaffected by wholesale inventory changes, Lorillard's domestic retail market share once again posted solid gains in the first nine months of 2012, increasing 0.2 share points to 14.4%. Newport's domestic retail market share reached 12.1% for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 0.1 share points compared to the first nine months of 2011. Lorillard's domestic retail share of the menthol market reached 39.7% for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 0.5 share points compared to the first nine months of 2011. Newport's share of the menthol segment year to date was 36.5%, up 0.2 share points. Gains in market share were largely attributable to unit volume outperformance of Newport Menthol versus the category in our core markets despite the heightened level of competitive activity, and to a lesser extent, continued growth of Maverick.
Adjusted gross profit was $1.745 billion in the first nine months of 2012, or 35.5% of net sales, compared to $1.705 billion, or 35.2% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2011. As detailed in the reconciliation table, adjusted gross profit excludes the unfavorable impact on tobacco settlement expense of $7 million resulting from a competitor's adjustments in the first quarter of 2012 to certain historical components of the calculation of the industry volume adjustment offset under the State Settlement Agreements. Such adjustments related to the competitor's operating income for 2001  2005. Adjusted gross profit reflects the increase in net sales and lower costs for the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers, partially offset by higher adjusted costs related to the State Settlement Agreements, higher raw material input costs (primarily tobacco and other direct costs) and higher Food and Drug Administration user fees.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $40 million to $382 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011 primarily as a result of higher legal costs related to the Engle Progeny litigation, $6 million of expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of blu eCigs and $11 million of blu eCigs' marketing and administrative costs.
Interest expense increased $24 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011 and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Lorillard's effective income tax rate was 36.5% in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 36.8% in the first nine months of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in the Company's manufacturing deduction in 2012 and the settlement of certain federal and state tax matters.
Adjusted net income in the first nine months of 2012 was $799 million, or $6.10 per share (diluted), compared to $806 million, or $5.69 per share (diluted), in the first nine months of 2011, representing a 7.2% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Reported net income in the first nine months of 2012 was $790 million, or $6.03 per share (diluted). Post acquisition, blu eCigs incurred a $5 million adjusted operating loss.

The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported gross profit, reported operating profit, reported net income and reported diluted earnings per share available to Lorillard common stockholders, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012. Lorillard management uses adjusted (non-GAAP) measurements to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company, and believes that investors' understanding of the underlying performance of the company's continuing operations is enhanced through the disclosure of these metrics. Adjusted (non-GAAP) results are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for reported (GAAP) results.
The adjustments to reported results summarized below remove the following items: (1) expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of blu eCigs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated condensed statements of income and (2) the unfavorable impact of adjustments to certain operating income data as reported in the years 2001 through 2005 by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company ("RJRT") in the first quarter of 2012 on Lorillard's tobacco settlement expense, which is included in cost of sales on the accompanying consolidated condensed statements of income. Amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements are impacted by a number of factors, including industry volume, market share, and industry operating profits. As a result of these adjustments provided to the Independent Auditor under the State Settlement Agreements by RJRT, the industry operating profits, as defined in those agreements, were increased. As a result, our costs related to the State Settlement Agreements for the first quarter of 2012 have been increased. The increase in our costs associated with these adjustments reported by RJRT amounted to approximately $7 million and was recorded in the first quarter of 2012. If further prior year profit adjustments are reported by industry participants in the future, our costs related to the State Settlement Agreements could be affected, either up or down.
