For purposes of the Plan, extraordinary items shall mean (1) any profit or loss attributable to acquisitions or dispositions of stock or assets, (2) any changes in accounting standards that may be required or permitted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or adopted by the Company after the goal is established, (3) all items of gain, loss or expense for the year related to restructuring charges for the Company, (4) all items of gain, loss or expense for the year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business, (5) all items of gain, loss or expense for the year related to discontinued operations that do not qualify as a segment of a business as defined in APB Opinion No. 30, and (6) such other items as may be prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder as may be in effect from time to time, and any amendments, revisions or successor provisions and any changes thereto. The Committee shall, prior to making payment under any award under this Section 6.5, certify in writing that all applicable Performance Goals have been attained. The Committee may establish such other rules applicable to Performance Awards to the extent not inconsistent with Section 162(m) of the Code.
6.6 .
Other Stock- or Other Cash-Based Awards
(a) The Committee is authorized to grant Awards to Participants in the form of Other Stock-Based Awards or Other Cash-Based Awards, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Other Stock-Based awards, consisting of stock purchase rights, Awards of Company Stock, or Awards valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Company Stock, may be granted either alone or in addition to or in conjunction with other Awards under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Awards shall be made, the number of shares of Company Stock to be granted pursuant to such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any such Award shall be confirmed by an Award Certificate executed by the Company and the Participant, which Award Certificate shall contain such provisions as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Plan with respect to such Award.
(b) To the extent necessary to satisfy the "short-term deferral" exception to Section 409A of the Code, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise, the Awards shall provide that payment shall be made within 2
 1
/
2
months after the end of the performance period to which the Award relates. With respect to Other Stock- or Other Cash-Based Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, such Award shall comply with the requirements of Section 6.5 hereof.
6.7 .
Exercisability of Awards; Cancellation of Awards in Certain Cases
(a) Except as hereinafter provided, each Award Certificate with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall set forth the period during which and the conditions subject to which the Option or Stock Appreciation Right evidenced thereby shall be exercisable, and each Award Certificate with respect to a Restricted Stock award, Restricted Stock Unit award, Stock Bonus award, Performance Award or other applicable award shall set forth the period after which and the conditions subject to which the shares underlying such Award shall vest or be deliverable, all such periods and conditions to be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
(b) Except as provided in Section 7 hereof, no Option or Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised and no shares of Company Stock underlying any other Award under the Plan may vest or become deliverable unless the Participant is at such time in the employ (for Participants who are employees) or service (for Participants who are Non-employee Directors or consultants) of the Company or a Subsidiary (or a company, or a parent or subsidiary company of such company, issuing or assuming the relevant right or award in a transaction) and has remained continuously so employed or in service since the relevant date of grant of the Award.
(c) An Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable by the filing of a written notice of exercise or a notice of exercise in such other manner with the Company, on such form and in such manner as the Committee shall in its sole discretion prescribe, and by payment in accordance with Section 6.8 hereof.
(d) Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, at any time after the Company's receipt of written notice of exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right and prior to the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise date (as defined in Section 6.7(e)), and in the case of a
 
stock award or Performance Award, at any time within the six (6) business days immediately preceding the otherwise applicable date on which the previously Restricted Stock, stock award or Performance Award would otherwise have become unconditionally vested or the shares subject thereto unconditionally deliverable, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the right, by written notice to the Participant, to cancel such Award or any part thereof if the Committee, in its sole judgment, determines that legal or contractual restrictions and/or blockage and/or other market considerations would make the Company's acquisition of Company Stock from, and/or the Participant's sale of Company Stock to, the public markets illegal, impracticable or inadvisable. If the Committee determines to cancel all or any part of an Award, the Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Award or part thereof canceled (determined as of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise date, or the date that shares would have been unconditionally vested or delivered in the case of Restricted Stock, Stock Bonus or Performance Award), over (ii) the aggregate Option exercise price or the Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or part thereof canceled (in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right) or any amount payable as a condition of delivery of shares (in the case of Restricted Stock, Stock Bonus or Performance Award). Such amount shall be delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable after such Award or part thereof is canceled.
(e) Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, the "Option exercise date" and the "Stock Appreciation Right exercise date" shall be the date that the written notice of exercise, together with payment, are received by the Company.
6.8 .
Payment of Award Price
(a) Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise or the Committee in its sole discretion otherwise determines, any written notice of exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right must be accompanied by payment of the full exercise price. If Section 6.7(d) applies, and the six (6) business day delay for the Option exercise date is applied, the Participant shall have no right to pay the Option exercise price or to receive Company Stock with respect to the Option prior to the lapse of such six (6) business days.
(b) Payment of the Option exercise price and of any other payment required by the Award Certificate to be made pursuant to any other Award shall be made in any combination of the following: (a) by certified or official bank check payable to the Company (or the equivalent thereof acceptable to the Committee), (b) with the consent of the Committee in its sole discretion, by personal check (subject to collection) which may in the Committee's discretion be deemed conditional, (c) unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Certificate, and as permitted by the Committee, by delivery of previously-acquired shares of Company Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value (determined as of the Option exercise date, in the case of Options, or other relevant payment date as determined by the Committee, in the case of other Awards) equal to the portion of the exercise price being paid thereby; and/or (d) unless otherwise provided in applicable Award Certificate, and as permitted by the Committee, on a net-settlement basis with the Company withholding the amount of Company Stock sufficient to cover the exercise price and tax withholding obligation. Payment in accordance with clause (a) of this Section 6.8(b) may be deemed to be satisfied, if and to the extent that the applicable Award Certificate so provides or the Committee permits, by delivery to the Company of an assignment of a sufficient amount of the proceeds from the sale of Company Stock to be acquired pursuant to the Award to pay for all of the Company Stock to be acquired pursuant to the Award and an authorization to the broker or selling agent to pay that amount to the Company and to effect such sale at the time of exercise or other delivery of shares of Company Stock.
 
(a) With respect to vested awards, unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise or the Committee in its sole discretion otherwise determines, the term of each Award shall end on the earliest of the date on which (1) such Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised in full, all restrictions on such Restricted Stock award have lapsed in full, shares in respect of such Restricted Stock Unit award have been delivered, or such Performance Award, Annual Incentive Award, Stock Bonus Award, Other Stock-Based Award, or Other Cash-Based Award has been paid or settled, (2) except as described in (3), (4) or (5) below, the date on which the Participant experiences a Termination, (3) with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that has vested and become exercisable, the one-year anniversary of the date on which the Participant dies or suffers a Disability, (4) with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that has vested and become exercisable, the three-year anniversary of the date on which the Participant experiences a Termination due to such Participant's Retirement, (5) with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that has vested and become exercisable, the end of the ninety (90) day period following the date the Participant experiences a Termination for any reason not listed in (3) or (4) above, or (6) with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the tenth (10
th
) anniversary of the date of grant.
(b) With respect to unvested awards, unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, or the Committee in its sole discretion otherwise determines, upon the occurrence of a Termination of a Participant for any
 
reason, all outstanding Awards that are unvested, unexercisable, restricted or subject to any performance condition, as of the date of such Termination, shall be immediately forfeited, provided, however, that the Committee, in its sole discretion (but in a manner not inconsistent with Section 162(m) of the Code), may accelerate the vesting, extend the exercise period and remove any restriction or performance condition with respect to any outstanding Award (but with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, not beyond the ten (10) year anniversary of the date of grant).
 
(a) Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise or the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise, in the event of a Change of Control:
(i) any Award carrying a right to exercise that was not previously exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested; and
(ii) the restrictions, deferral limitations, payment conditions, and forfeiture conditions applicable to any other Award granted under the Plan shall lapse and such Awards shall be deemed fully vested, and any Performance Goals imposed with respect to Awards shall be deemed to be fully achieved at the target level.
(b) Upon a Change in Control, the Committee may provide for the cancellation of all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then outstanding. Upon such cancellation, the Company shall make, in exchange for each such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, a payment either in (i) cash, (ii) shares of the successor entity, or (iii) a combination of cash or shares, at the discretion of the Committee, and in each case as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion determine, in an amount per share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock as of the date of the Change in Control over the per share exercise price of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right.
 
(a) Award Certificates evidencing Awards under the Plan shall contain such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, including penalties for the commission of competitive acts or other actions detrimental to the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Committee shall have the right at any time to deny or delay a Participant's exercise of Options if the Committee reasonably believes the Participant (i) to be engaged in material conduct adversely affecting the Company or (ii) to be contemplating such conduct, unless and until the Committee shall have received reasonable assurance that the Participant is not engaged in, and is not contemplating, such material conduct adverse to the interests of the Company.
(b) Participants are and at all times shall remain subject to the trading window policies adopted by the Company from time to time throughout the period of time during which they may exercise Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or sell shares of Company Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan.
 
(a) Nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Certificate shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of employment or service by the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company, subject to the terms of any separate employment agreement to the contrary, at any time to terminate such employment or service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant.
(b) No person shall have any claim or right to receive an Award hereunder. The Committee's granting of an Award to a Participant at any time shall neither require the Committee to grant any other Award to such Participant or other person at any time nor preclude the Committee from making subsequent grants to such Participant or any other person.
 
(a) The Company shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of any interests in the Plan or any shares of Company Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to cause to be issued or delivered any certificates evidencing shares of Company Stock pursuant to the Plan unless and until the Company is advised by its counsel that the issuance and delivery of such certificates is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Company Stock are traded. The Committee may require, as a condition of the issuance and delivery of certificates evidencing shares of Company Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such agreements and representations, and that such certificates bear such legends, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable.
(b) The transfer of any shares of Company Stock hereunder shall be effective only at such time as counsel to the Company shall have determined that the issuance and delivery of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Company Stock are traded. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, defer the effectiveness of any transfer of shares of Company Stock hereunder in order to allow the issuance of such shares to be made pursuant to registration or an exemption from registration or other methods for compliance available under federal or state securities laws. The Committee shall inform the Participant in writing of its decision to defer the effectiveness of a transfer. During the period of such deferral in connection with the exercise of an Award, the Participant may, by written notice, withdraw such exercise and obtain the refund of any amount paid with respect thereto.
 
(a) Whenever cash is to be paid pursuant to an Award, the Company shall have the right to deduct therefrom an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto.
(b) Whenever shares of Company Stock are to be delivered pursuant to an Award, the Company shall have the right to require the Participant to remit to the Company in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto. With the approval of the Committee, a Participant may satisfy the foregoing requirement by electing to have the Company withhold from delivery shares of Company Stock having a value equal to the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld. Such shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Fractional share amounts shall be settled in cash.
 
The Board of Directors or the Committee may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; provided, however, that stockholder approval shall be required if and to the extent the Board of Directors or Committee determines that such approval is appropriate or necessary for purposes of satisfying Sections 162(m) or 422 of the Code or Rule 16b-3 or other applicable law. Awards may be granted under the Plan prior to the receipt of such stockholder approval of the Plan but each such grant shall be subject in its entirety to such approval and no Award may be exercised, vested or otherwise satisfied prior to the receipt of such approval. No amendment or termination of the Plan may, without the consent of a Participant, adversely affect the Participant's rights under any outstanding Award.
 
(a) A Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of a beneficiary on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee and may, from time to time, amend or revoke such designation. If no designated beneficiary survives the Participant, upon the death of a Participant, outstanding Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised only by the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate or by a person who shall have acquired the right to such exercise by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No transfer of an Award by will or the laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Award that are or would have been applicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgments made by the Participant in connection with the grant of the Award.
(b) During a Participant's lifetime, the Committee may, in its discretion, pursuant to the provisions set forth in this clause (b), permit the transfer, assignment or other encumbrance of an outstanding Option unless such Option is an ISO and the Committee and the Participant intends that it shall retain such status. Subject to the approval of the Committee and to any conditions that the Committee may prescribe, a Participant may, upon providing written notice to the General Counsel of the Company, elect to transfer any or all Options granted to such Participant pursuant to the Plan to members of
 
his or her immediate family, including, but not limited to, children, grandchildren and spouse or to trusts for the benefit of such immediate family members or to partnerships in which such family members are the only partners; provided, however, that no such transfer by any Participant may be made in exchange for consideration. Any such transferee must agree, in writing, to be bound by all provisions of the Plan.
 
The Plan shall become effective on the Effective Date. Any Awards granted on or after the first regularly scheduled meeting of the shareholders of the Company that occurs more than twelve (12) months after the date the Company becomes a separate publicly-held corporation, within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Separation Date") shall be subject to approval of the stockholders of the Company. In the absence of such approval, Awards made after the Separation Date shall be null and void. Unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the right to grant Awards under the Plan shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Effective Date if such stockholder approval is not obtained and on the tenth anniversary of the approval of the Plan by the Company's stockholders if such stockholder approval is obtained. Awards outstanding at Plan termination shall remain in effect according to their terms and the provisions of the Plan.
 
Except to the extent preempted by any applicable federal law, the Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law.
 
(a) No Person shall have any claim to be granted any award under the Plan. Except as provided specifically herein, a Participant or a transferee of an Award shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by any award until the date of the issuance of a Company Stock certificate to him or her for such shares.
(b) Determinations by the Committee under the Plan relating to the form, amount and terms and conditions of grants and Awards need not be uniform, and may be made selectively among persons who receive or are eligible to receive grants and awards under the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated.
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Certificate shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
 
No fractional shares of Company Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
 
The Plan is designed and intended to the extent applicable, to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code, and to provide for grants and other transactions which are exempt under Rule 16b-3, and all provisions hereof shall be construed in a manner to so comply. Awards under the Plan are intended to comply with Code Section 409A and all Awards shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the effective date of the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award Certificate to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Award may or does not comply with Code Section 409A, the Company may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the affected Award (without Participant consent) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Plan and any Award from the application of Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of Awards or (ii) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
