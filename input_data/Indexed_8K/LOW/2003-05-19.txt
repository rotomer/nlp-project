- Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the world's second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $421 million for the quarter ended May 2, 2003, a 21.7 percent increase over the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 20.5 percent to $0.53 from $0.44 in the first quarter of 2002.
WILKESBORO, N.C.
Sales for the quarter increased 11.4 percent to $7.21 billion, up from $6.47 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Comparable store sales for the first quarter increased 0.1 percent.
"A strong housing market and improving consumer confidence continue to support the American conviction to invest in the home despite the effect of adverse weather and uncertain world events," commented Robert L. Tillman, Lowe's chairman and CEO. "In a society where home is increasingly the centerpiece of the American dream, Lowe's makes it easy for our customers to express their unique taste and style by providing compelling stores, knowledgeable service, and great products at guaranteed low prices."
During the quarter, Lowe's opened 21 new stores. As of May 2, 2003, Lowe's operated 875 stores in 45 states representing 97.2 million square feet of retail selling space, a 12.9 percent increase over last year.

Comments Regarding Adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor", was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003.  The January 2003 transition rules stated that this issue would apply to all agreements entered into or significantly modified after December 31, 2002.
As we have previously announced, our current accounting treatment for vendor provided funds is consistent with the provisions of this issue with the exception of cooperative advertising allowances or co-op.  We currently account for co-op as direct offsets against advertising expenses.  Under EITF 02-16, these types of funds can only be used to offset advertising expenses if the co-op funds are a reimbursement of a specific, identifiable and incremental cost incurred by Lowe's in selling the vendor's product.
We do not expect this issue to have a material impact on our fiscal 2003 financial statements since substantially all of our cooperative advertising allowance agreements for fiscal 2003 were entered into prior to December 31, 2002.
We have assessed the historic volume of co-op reimbursements that have been received in order to determine which of these reimbursements would meet the specific, identifiable and incremental criteria outlined under this issue and accordingly, qualify as a direct offset to advertising expense.  Based on our analysis of the impact on net income, and the administrative costs to identify and track reimbursements between those qualifying for expense offset and those requiring inventory cost reduction, we have elected to treat all co-op funds received from vendors as a reduction in the cost of inventory and recognize them as a reduction to cost of goods sold when the inventory is liquidated.  We estimate that the prospective change in the timing of income recognition will reduce fiscal 2004 EPS by approximately $0.12 per share.  Had our vendor agreements for fiscal 2003 not been entered into prior to December 31, 2002, we estimate that the reduction of EPS would be approximately $0.11 per share in fiscal 2003.
The adoption of this issue does not change the ultimate cash to be received under these agreements nor the timing of cash flows, only the timing of when it is reflected in net income. In short, this represents a change only in the timing of earnings recognition, not in the amount of earnings ultimately recognized over the terms of the agreements.
