"This year's outstanding results are further evidence that Lowe's strategic course is a proven success," said Robert L. Tillman, Lowe's chairman
and CEO.  "Our employees' diligent efforts led to what was among the best two-year performances in all of retail.  We're confident we have
our finger on the pulse of consumer and business trends and will continue to build on our successful operating model to maintain our premier
position in retailing well into the future."
 
"Despite the weather-driven challenges we faced in the first quarter of 2003, our management team and dedicated employees kept their eye on
the ball and delivered an outstanding year on top of a phenomenal performance in 2002," explained Lowe's President Robert A. Niblock.
"We continue to see strong results from our metro-market expansion, and our up-the-continuum merchandising strategy and branding initiatives
continue to provide our customers the best products and services to meet their home improvement needs.  The key ingredient in this formula
remains our outstanding customer service, which we continue to deliver in an aspirational store environment."
 
During the quarter, Lowe's opened 47 new stores, including one relocation.  As of January 30, 2004, Lowe's operated 952 stores in 45 states
representing 108.8 million square feet of retail selling space, a 14.8 percent increase over last year.

The impact of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor", will be recognized in 2004 and modifies accounting for certain funds received from vendors.
 
Prior to 2004, funds from vendors for co-op advertising and in-store services were allowed to be treated as a direct offset to the associated
expense.  EITF 02-16 requires retailers to treat certain of these funds as a reduction of cost of goods, recognizing the benefit when the
inventory is sold.  There is no impact to the timing of when the funds are received from vendors or the associated cash flows, but there is an
impact to the timing of income recognition.
