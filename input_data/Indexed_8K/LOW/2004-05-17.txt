MOORESVILLE, N.C.  - Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the world's second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $455 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2004, an 8.1 percent increase over the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 7.5 percent to $0.57 from $0.53 in the first quarter of 2003. Excluding the $126 million net earnings and $0.16 per share impact of EITF 02-16, net earnings would have been $581 million, a 38.0 percent increase over last year's first quarter and diluted earnings per share would have increased 37.7 percent to $0.73. Sales for the quarter increased 22.0 percent to $8.68 billion, up from $7.12 billion in the first quarter of 2003. Comparable store sales for the first quarter increased 9.9 percent. "The right store format, the right products and consistently excellent service have proven quarter after quarter that Lowe's has the right business model to meet our customers' needs," explained Robert L. Tillman, Lowe's chairman and CEO. "Consumer focus on the home remains constant, and Lowe's remains uniquely positioned to satisfy that need and capitalize on the growth of the home improvement market." "Strength in every product category and across every geographic region drove solid earnings growth in the first quarter," said Lowe's President, Robert A. Niblock. "Continued strong sales in big-ticket categories such as outdoor power equipment and kitchen cabinets is an indication that consumers are not only willing, but are enthusiastic about investing in products and projects that maintain and enhance their greatest asset - their home." During the quarter, Lowe's opened 29 new stores, and closed one store. As of April 30, 2004, Lowe's operated 980 stores in 45 states representing 111.9 million square feet of retail selling space, a 15.1 percent increase over last year. A conference call to discuss first quarter 2004 operating results is scheduled for today (Monday, May 17) at 9:00 a.m. EDT. Please dial 888-817-4020 (international callers dial 706-679-3245) to participate. A webcast of the call will take place simultaneously and can be accessed by visiting Lowe's website at www.Lowes.com/investor and clicking on Lowe's First Quarter 2004 Earnings Conference Call Webcast. A replay of the call will be archived on Lowes.com for seven days.  
The impact of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor," is being recognized in 2004 and modifies accounting for certain funds received from vendors. Prior to 2004, funds received from vendors for co-op advertising and in-store services were allowed to be treated as a direct offset to the associated expense. EITF 02-16 requires retailers to treat certain of these funds as a reduction of cost of goods, delaying recognition of the benefit of these funds until the inventory is sold. There is no impact to the timing of when the funds are received from vendors or the associated cash flows.  
 
This outlook is based on current expectations and includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Although the company believes that comments reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
