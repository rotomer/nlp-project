MOORESVILLE, N.C.  - Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the world's second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $704 million for the quarter ended July 30, 2004, a 17.9 percent increase over the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 18.7 percent to $0.89 from $0.75 in the second quarter of 2003. For the six months ended July 30, 2004, net earnings grew 14 percent to $1.16 billion while diluted earnings per share increased 14.2 percent to $1.45. Sales for the quarter increased 17.3 percent to $10.2 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the second quarter of 2003. Comparable store sales for the second quarter increased 5.1 percent.  For the six months ended July 30, 2004, sales increased 19.4 percent to $18.9 billion.  Comparable store sales increased 7.2 percent in the first half of 2004. "Robust housing turnover, record home ownership, attractive mortgage rates and improving consumer confidence highlighted a solid performance in the second quarter where our stores delivered record earnings," explained Robert L. Tillman, Lowe's chairman and CEO.  "A strong and vibrant housing market, combined with the commitment of our employees to provide excellent customer service, are the foundations for our confidence in the future."
 
"Following a solid start to the quarter, sales weakened in June as several factors, including adverse weather in many parts of the country, impacted consumers' ability to initiate typical late spring and early summer projects," said Lowe's President, Robert A. Niblock. "Sales rebounded in July, and we were pleased with the direction of business as the quarter concluded.  We continue to invest in our stores and enhance displays with product resets, ensuring a great shopping environment for our customers.  As our merchants continue to drive innovation and our stores provide excellent service, we're confident that we have the programs to deliver strong results in the second half of 2004." During the quarter, Lowe's opened 20 new stores including 3 relocations. As of July 30, 2004, Lowe's operated 997 stores in 45 states representing 113.8 million square feet of retail selling space, a 14.2 percent increase over last year.
