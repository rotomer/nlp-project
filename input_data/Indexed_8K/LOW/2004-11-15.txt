MOORESVILLE, N.C.  - Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the world's second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $522 million for the quarter ended October 29, 2004, a 15.5 percent increase over the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 17.9 percent to $0.66 from $0.56 in the third quarter of 2003. For the nine months ended October 29, 2004, net earnings grew 14.4 percent to $1.68 billion while diluted earnings per share increased 14.7 percent to $2.11.
 
Sales for the quarter increased 16.2 percent to $9.1 billion, up from $7.8 billion in the third quarter of 2003. Comparable store sales for the third quarter increased 5.2 percent. For the nine months ended October 29, 2004, sales increased 18.3 percent to $27.9 billion. Comparable store sales increased 6.6 percent for the first nine months of 2004.
 
"The results our employees delivered in the third quarter are a clear indication that our stores are meeting customer needs with great products and industry leading customer service every day," explained Robert L. Tillman, Lowe's chairman and CEO. "Continued signs of a robust housing market, improving employment and strong demographic trends provide a foundation for our optimism for the future."
 
"Third quarter sales performance continued our trend of consistently strong performance. A 5.2 percent increase in comparable store sales on top of the 12.2 percent increase in last year's third quarter represents the best two-year performance for Lowe's in nearly a decade," said Lowe's President Robert A. Niblock . "These consistent results are based on a singular, company-wide focus on serving our customers' ever-changing needs. 'Improving Home Improvement' is more than a mantra, it's what we live in every store every day, as we strive to improve the shopping experience with better products, more inspirational displays and great customer service."
 
During the quarter, Lowe's opened 35 new stores including one relocation. As of October 29, 2004, Lowe's operated 1,031 stores in 45 states representing 117.5 million square feet of retail selling space, a 13.4 percent increase over last year.
