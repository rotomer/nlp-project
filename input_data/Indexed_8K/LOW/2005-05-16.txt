MOORESVILLE, N.C.
-
Lowes Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the worlds second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $590 million for the quarter ended April 29, 2005, a 30.5 percent increase over the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share increased 32.1 percent to $0.74 from $0.56 in the first quarter of 2004. These comparisons are influenced by the adoption of EITF 02-16 which had the effect of reducing net earnings in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Sales for the quarter increased 14.2 percent to $9.91 billion, up from $8.68 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Comparable store sales for the first quarter increased 3.8 percent.
While an unusually cold, wet March in many parts of the country created challenges, our stores delivered another strong quarter, explained Robert A. Niblock, Lowes chairman, president and CEO.  We achieved high single-digit comparable store sales in February and April, but they were offset by negative low single-digit comps in weather-affected March. 
 
We continue to make investments in new stores, improve existing stores and build the infrastructure to facilitate our expansion, and we remain optimistic about the outlook for the balance of the year, Niblock added.  Our Installed Sales, Special Order Sales, and Commercial Business Customers continue to drive our comparable store sales momentum, and were working hard to continuously improve our customers experience with inspiring products and great customer service.
During the quarter, Lowes opened 27 new stores, including 2 relocations. As of April 29, 2005, Lowes operated 1,112 stores in 48 states representing 126.5 million square feet of retail selling space, a 13.1 percent increase over last year.
