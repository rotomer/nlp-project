The Plan, as amended and restated, permits the Board of Directors to grant to non-employee directors either deferred stock units representing shares of Lowes common stock or options to purchase shares of Lowes common stock under the Plan.

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to shares subject to an Option or Deferred Stock Unit until the date of exercise of such Option or the date the Participant receives shares of Common Stock in payment of the Deferred Stock Units credited to the Participants Deferral Account under the Plan.
A Participant shall be entitled to a payment under this Article IX if (i) any benefit, payment, accelerated vesting or other right under this Plan constitutes a parachute payment (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A), but without regard to Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii)), with respect to such Participant and (ii) the Participant incurs a liability under Code Section 4999. The amount payable to a Participant described in the preceding sentence shall be the amount required to indemnify the Participant and hold the Participant harmless from the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999. To effect this indemnification, the Company shall pay such Participant an amount sufficient to pay the excise tax imposed on Participant under Code section 4999 with respect to benefits, payments, accelerated vesting and other rights under this Plan and any other plan or agreement and any income, self-employment, hospitalization, excise or other taxes attributable to the indemnification payment. The benefit payable under this Article IX shall be paid in a single cash sum not later than twenty days after the date (or extended filing date) on which the tax return reflecting liability for the Code Section 4999 excise tax is required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the terms of any other plan or agreement also require that a Participant be indemnified and held harmless from the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999, any such indemnification and the amount required to be paid to a Participant under this Article XI shall be coordinated so that such indemnification is paid only once, and the Companys obligation under this Article XI shall be satisfied to the extent of any such other payment.
10
The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Plan, and the number of shares as to which Options and Deferred Stock Units may be granted under this Plan as of the applicable Award Date, and the terms of outstanding Options and Deferred Stock Units shall be adjusted as the Board shall determine to be equitably required in the event that (a) the Company (i) effects one or more stock dividends, stock split-ups, subdivisions or consolidations of shares or (ii) engages in a transaction to which Section 424 of the Code applies or (b) there occurs any other event which, in the judgment of the Board necessitates such action. Any determination made under this Article X by the Board shall be final and conclusive.
The issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the maximum number of shares as to which Options and Deferred Stock Units may be granted or the terms of outstanding Options and Deferred Stock Units.
No Option shall be exercisable, no Common Stock shall be issued, and no certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be delivered under this Plan except in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations (including, without limitation, withholding tax requirements), any listing agreement to which the Company is a party, and the rules of all domestic stock exchanges on which the Companys shares may be listed. The Company shall have the right to rely on an opinion of its counsel as to such compliance. Any share certificate issued to evidence Common Stock when an Option is exercised or when a Deferred Stock Unit is converted to Common Stock may bear such legends and statements as the Board may deem advisable to assure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. No Option shall be exercisable, no Common Stock shall be issued, and no certificate for shares shall be delivered under this Plan until the Company has obtained such consent or approval as the Board may deem advisable from regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such matters.

12.
02
 
Unfunded Plan
.
The Plan, insofar as it provides for grants, shall be unfunded, and the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by grants under this Plan. Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to any grant under this Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created pursuant to this Plan. No such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property of the Company.

Rules of Construction
.
Headings are given to the articles and sections of this Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. The reference to any statute, regulation, or other provision of law shall be construed to refer to any amendment to or successor of such provision of law.
The Board may amend or terminate this Plan from time to time; provided, however, that no amendment may become effective until shareholder approval is obtained if the amendment (i) increases the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan (other than an adjustment pursuant to Article X), (ii) changes the class of individuals eligible to become Participants, (iii) expands the types of awards available under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, (v) materially changes the method of determining the exercise price of an Option, (vi) deletes or limits any provisions regarding repricing of Options, or (vii) otherwise is considered a material revision pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-48108. No amendment shall, without a Participants consent, adversely affect any rights of such Participant under any Option or Deferred Stock Unit outstanding at the time such amendment is made. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Board may amend or modify the Plan to the extent necessary to cause the Plan to comply with the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004) and any rules or regulations issued thereunder by the United States Department of the Treasury.
12
No Option or Deferred Stock Unit may be granted under this Plan after the Award Date in 2008. Options and Deferred Stock Units granted before that date shall remain valid in accordance with their terms.
Options and Deferred Stock Units may be granted under this amended and restated Plan upon its adoption by the Board, provided that no grant of Deferred Stock Units shall be effective or exercisable unless this Plan is approved by a majority of the votes cast by the Companys shareholders, voting either in person or by proxy, at a duly held shareholders meeting at which a quorum is present.

Pond, 59, joined Lowes in 1993, after serving in a number of senior management roles at other home improvement companies, leading retailers and an advertising agency.
Dale has been a great asset to Lowes over the past 12 years and served as a key member of the team that developed and implemented our enhanced store environment, product offering and marketing campaigns, said Robert A. Niblock, chairman, president and CEO. We thank Dale for his contributions and wish him well as he enjoys his retirement.
Pond will be replaced by 36-year Lowes veteran Larry D. Stone, 53, currently senior executive vice president of operations. Stones responsibilities will include merchandising, marketing, store planning/development and store remerchandising. In his new role, Stone will be responsible for all aspects of Lowes store environment.
Larry Stone is widely regarded as one of the top store operations and merchandising executives in retail today, said Niblock. His deep experience and success in virtually every area of Lowes operations will allow us to build on our already strong merchandising and marketing programs.
Stone began his career at Lowes in 1969 and has served in a number of increasingly responsible positions in merchandising and operations. He has led Lowes store operations since 1996.

He has excelled in a number of key assignments and has consistently delivered outstanding results for the company. Nick will be an even greater asset to Lowes in this expanded role.
Canter began his Lowes career in 1974 and has served as senior vice president of store operations since 1999. In addition to running the companys North Central Division, he also led Lowes entry into the Northeast, launching new stores in the Boston and New York metropolitan areas.
