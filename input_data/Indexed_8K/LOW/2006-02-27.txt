MOORESVILLE, N.C.
Lowes Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the worlds second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $695 million for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2006, a 36.8 percent increase over the 13-week period ended January 28, 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 35.9 percent to $0.87 from $0.64 in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2006 increased 26.4 percent to $10.8 billion, up from $8.55 billion for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2005. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.8 percent versus a comparable 14-week period. For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2006, sales increased 18.6 percent to $43.2 billion. Comparable store sales increased 6.1 percent for fiscal 2005.
Our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results represent a focus on execution and a culture of customer service that solidifies Lowes competitive position across the country, explained Robert A. Niblock, Lowes chairman, president and CEO.  Amidst the challenges of a weather-affected 2005 spring selling season and the devastation caused by the most active hurricane season on record, we were ready to serve customers and provide products, services and solutions to meet their home improvement needs.
Our Installed Sales, Special Order Sales and Commercial Business Customer initiatives continue to deliver great results and remain key drivers of our performance, helping us achieve 2005 comparable store sales in excess of six percent for the third consecutive year, Niblock added.  As we continue to monitor the changing economic environment, including housing-related metrics, employment, real wage growth and demographic trends, we have confidence in our future performance as the outlook for home improvement spending remains strong.  Our more than 185,000 employees and over 1,200 best-in-class stores are a true competitive advantage, and part of the reason Lowes was recently recognized as the Best Managed Company in retail by Forbes magazine.
We will continue to invest in this advantage with a focus on increasing employee expertise, enhancing our easy-to-shop stores, and improving our compelling merchandise offering.
During the quarter, Lowes opened 63 new stores and reopened one store temporarily closed as a result of hurricane Katrina. As of February 3, 2006, Lowes operated 1,234 stores in 49 states representing 140.1 million square feet of retail selling space, a 13.2 percent increase over last year.

Fiscal 2006 annual and fourth quarter comparisons will be negatively impacted by a 52 vs. 53 week and 13 vs. 14 week comparison, respectively.  In addition, our 2006 quarterly comparisons will be impacted by a shift in comparable weeks to 2005.  This week shift positively impacts the first quarter and is offset by negative impacts in the second and fourth quarters.  Our 2006 guidance contemplates these factors.
