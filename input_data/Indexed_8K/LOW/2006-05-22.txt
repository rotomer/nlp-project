For 7:00 am EDT Release
Fiscal 2006 annual and fourth quarter comparisons will be negatively impacted by a 52 versus 53 week and 13 versus 14 week comparison, respectively.  In addition, our 2006 quarterly comparisons will be impacted by a shift in comparable weeks to 2005.  This week shift positively impacts the first quarter and is offset by negative impacts in the second and fourth quarters.  The week shift does not impact comparable store sales results. Our 2006 guidance contemplates these factors.
Second Quarter 2006
(comparisons to second quarter 2005)
Fiscal Year 2006 - a 52-week Year
(comparisons to fiscal year 2005 - a 53-week year)
