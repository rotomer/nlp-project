ITEM 5.03
 
AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
 
(a)
 
On January 26, 2007, the Board of Directors approved certain amendments to the Companys Bylaws. The amendments make the following changes to the Bylaws, all of
which were effective immediately:
 
  (i)
   
   
  
Article II, Section 7 was amended to provide that the standard for electing directors shall be as set forth in the corporations Articles of Incorporation.
 
(ii)
  
Article III, Section 2 was amended to delete the sentence that provided that the number of directors on the Board shall be eleven, divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible. The sentence was unnecessary because the Companys Articles of Incorporation already provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible, and, under North Carolina law, either the articles of incorporation or the bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two, three or four groups.
 
  (iii)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 2 was amended to provide that the directors may by appropriate resolution adopted between annual meetings of shareholders increase or
  decrease the number of directors, but may not decrease the number of directors below the minimum number specified in the corporations Articles of Incorporation. Prior
   
   
  to this amendment, Article III, Section 2 provided that the directors could amend the Bylaws between meetings of shareholders to increase or decrease the number of
   
   
 
  directors to make vacancies available for the election of new directors.
   
   
 
  (iv)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 3 was deleted in its entirety to remove the definition of a Founding Director.
 
As a result of deleting Section 3 of Article III of the Bylaws, the subsequent sections of Article III have now been renumbered.  The section references
  NOTE:
   
   
  in subparagraphs 
   
   
(v) - (ix) below of this report on Form 8-K, however, are to the applicable section numbers in Article III of the Bylaws before the subsequent sections
  were renumbered.  The changes to the Bylaws described below regarding the committee composition requirements were made by the Board of Directors solely to
   
   
  conform the relevant sections of the Company's Bylaws to the committee composition requirements already set forth in the committee charters. 
   
   
  (v)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 4 was amended to provide for regular meetings of the Board of Directors (as opposed to quarterly meetings) to be held with such
 frequency (but no less than quarterly) as shall be determined by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
   
 
 
  (vi)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 16 was amended as follows:
 
   
   
   
   
  
to make the composition requirements for the Audit Committee consistent with the membership requirements set forth in the Committees Charter by
   providing that the Committee shall be comprised entirely of members of the Board who qualify as independent under the requirements of the Corporate
   
   
   
   Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
   
   
   
   Exchange Commission;
   
   
   
 
   
   
   
   
  
to provide that the Audit Committee shall have the authority to act for the Board of Directors in any matter delegated to the Committee by the Board in the
   written charter of the Committee or otherwise;
   
   
   
 
   
   
   
   
  
to provide that the Audit Committee shall each year appoint and determine the compensation of (as opposed to recommend) an independent registered
   public accounting firm as the independent registered public accounting firm for the corporation. This change makes the sections provisions consistent with the
   
   
   
   provisions of the Audit Committees Charter; and
   
   
   
 
   
   
   
   
  
to delete the sentence providing that the corporations Head of Internal Audit shall report to the Audit Committee, and his or her employment may only be
   terminated with the approval of the Committee. (See subparagraph (x)
   
   
   
 below for the description of a related provision added to the Companys Bylaws.)
 
  (vii)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 17 was amended as follows:
 
 
   
  
to make the composition requirements for the Compensation and Organization Committee consistent with the membership requirements set forth in the
 Committees Charter by providing that the Committee shall be comprised entirely of members of the Board who qualify as independent under the requirements
   
 of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange and meet the definition of non-employee director of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities
   
 Exchange Act of 1934, and outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
   
 
 
   
  
to provide that the Compensation and Organization Committee shall have the authority to act for the Board of Directors in any matter delegated to the
 Committee by the Board in the written charter of the Committee or otherwise.
   
 
  (viii)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 18 was amended as follows:
 
 
   
  
to make the composition requirements for the Governance Committee consistent with the membership requirements set forth in the Committees Charter by
 providing that the Committee shall be comprised entirely of members of the Board who qualify as independent under the requirements of the Corporate
   
 Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange and meet the definition of non-employee director of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
   
 and shall include not less than one-half (1/2) of the members of the Board who qualify as independent; and
   
 
 
   
  
to provide that the Governance Committee shall have the authority to act for the Board of Directors in any matter delegated to the Committee by the Board
 in the written charter of the Committee or otherwise.
   
 
  (ix)
   
   
  
Article III, Section 20 was amended to provide that the compensation of non-employee directors (as opposed to independent directors) shall be
  recommended to the Board of Directors by the Chief Executive Officer.
   
   
 
  (x)
   
   
  
Article V, Section 3 was amended to provide for review and concurrence by the Audit Committee of the termination of the Vice President of Internal Audits
  employment with the corporation.
   
   
 
  (xi)
   
   
  
Article VII, Section 2 was amended to delete a reference to the Companys previously redeemed Rights Agreement between the Company and Wachovia Bank,
  N.A., Rights Agent, dated as of September 9, 1998.
   
   
  The amended and restated Bylaws are attached as Exhibit 3.1.

The principal office of the corporation in the State of North Carolina shall be located in the County of Iredell. The registered office of the corporation, required by law to be continuously maintained in the State of North Carolina, may be, but need not be, identical with the principal office and shall be maintained at that location identified as the address of the business office of the registered agent with the North Carolina Secretary of State. The corporation may have such other offices either within or without the State of North Carolina, as the Board of Directors may designate or the business of the corporation may require from time to time.
 
 
SECTION 1.
ANNUAL MEETING
. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held each year on a day in the month of May to be designated by the Board of Directors, at an hour to be designated by the Chairman of the Board, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. If the annual meeting shall not be held on the day designated by this Section 1, a substitute annual meeting shall be called in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Article II. A meeting so called shall be designated and treated for all purposes as the annual meeting.
 
SECTION 2.
SPECIAL MEETINGS
. Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Chairman of the Board or by a majority of the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 3.
PLACE OF MEETING
. The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of North Carolina, as the place of meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board of Directors. In the event the directors do not designate the place of meeting for either an annual or special meeting of the shareholders, the Chairman of the Board may designate the place of meeting. If the Chairman of the Board does not designate the place of meeting, the meeting shall be held at the offices of the corporation in Mooresville, North Carolina.
 
SECTION 4.
NOTICE OF MEETING
. Written notice stating the place, day, and
hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the day of the meeting, by mail, by or at the direction of the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Such notice, when mailed, shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. When a meeting is adjourned it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, in which event notice shall be given to shareholders as of the new record date.
 
 
SECTION 5.
CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS OR FIXING OF RECORD DATE
. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the corporation may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not to exceed, in any case, 60 days. If the stock transfer books shall be closed for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed for at least 10 days immediately preceding such meeting. In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than 70 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this Section 5, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof if the meeting is adjourned to a date not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
 
SECTION 6.
VOTING LISTS
. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make before each meeting of shareholders a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order and by voting group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares), with the address of and the number of shares held by each. For a period beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given and continuing through the meeting, this list shall be available at the corporation's principal office for inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours. The list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting. The original stock transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote any meeting of shareholders.
 
SECTION 7.
QUORUM
. Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting if a quorum of that voting group exists with respect to that matter. In the absence of a quorum at the opening of any meeting of shareholders, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the votes cast on the motion to adjourn. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, a Bylaw adopted by the shareholders, or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act requires a greater number of affirmative votes. The standard for electing directors shall be as set forth in the corporations Articles of Incorporation.
 
 
SECTION 8.
PROXIES; ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION
(a) At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after 11 months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. If a proxy for the same shares confers authority upon two or more persons and does not otherwise provide a majority of them present at the meeting or if only one is present at the meeting then that one may exercise all the powers conferred by the proxy; but if the proxy holders present at the meeting are divided as to the right and manner of voting in any particular case, and there is no majority, the voting of such shares shall be prorated.
(b) The secretary may approve procedures to enable a shareholder or a shareholders duly authorized attorney in fact to authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, internet transmission, telephone transmission or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the inspectors of election can determine that the transmission was authorized by the shareholder or the shareholders duly authorized attorney in fact. If it is determined that such transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon which they relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunications or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 8 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
SECTION 9.
VOTING OF SHARES
. Except as otherwise provided by law, each outstanding share of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. The vote of a majority of the shares voted on any matter at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the shareholders on that matter, unless the vote of a greater number is required by law or by the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. Voting on all substantive matters shall be by a ballot vote on that particular matter. Voting on procedural matters shall be by voice vote or by a show of hands unless the holders of one-tenth of the shares represented at the meeting shall demand a ballot vote on procedural matters.
 
SECTION 10.
CONDUCT OF MEETINGS
. At each meeting of the shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall act as chairman and preside. In his absence, the Board may designate another officer or director to preside. The Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or in their absence, a person whom the Chairman of such meeting shall appoint, shall act as secretary of the meeting.
At any meeting of shareholders, only business that is properly brought before the meeting may be presented to and acted upon by shareholders. To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be brought (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by a shareholder who has given timely notice in writing to the Secretary.

Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 10. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that any business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions prescribed by these Bylaws and, if the chairman should so determine, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not so properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
