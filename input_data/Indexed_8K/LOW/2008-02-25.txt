our results fell short of our expectations
,
I want to thank our more than 215,000
 
employees whose customer focus allowed us to capture
market share
in both the quarter and the year.  Those market share gains combined with appropriate expense management
in a very challenging environment fo
r the home improvement industry allowed us to deliver respectable annual earnings per share.
As we look to fiscal 2008, we know the next several quarters will be challenging on many fronts as industry sales are likely to remain soft
, Niblock continued.  We remain focused on what we can control:  providing great customer
service while managing expenses and offering customers the best shopping experience in home improvement.  As the year progresses, the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the approved fiscal stimulus package
are expected to
 
lend support to the broader economy and the consumer
.  As a result, many of the headwinds facing the housing market and the home improvement industry should lessen,
 
and consumers confidence in investing in and improving their homes
should improve
.
During the quarter, Lowes
opened
72
new stores
including two relocations.
  As of
February 1, 2008
, Lowes operated 1,
534 stores in the

million square feet of retail selling space, a
10.9
percent increase over last year.
