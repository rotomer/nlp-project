          SECTION 7.
Contribution
          If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
          The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
          The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
          Section 8. . All representations, warranties, indemnities, agreements and other statements of the Company or its officers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, any Underwriter or any person who controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Default by One or More of the Underwriters

     (b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
          No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
          In the event of any such default that does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Exhibit 5.1
April 15, 2010
Lowe's Companies, Inc. 1000 Lowe's Boulevard Mooresville, North Carolina 28117
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Lowe's Companies, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offer and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Notes due April 15, 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.800% Notes due 2040 (the "2040 Notes" and, together with the 2020 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-161697) filed by the Company (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and as described in the prospectus dated September 2, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated April 12, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"). With your permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made without any independent investigation or verification on our part except to the extent otherwise expressly stated, and we express no opinion with respect to the accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.
     The Notes will be issued pursuant to and governed by an amended and restated indenture dated as of December 1, 1995 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N. A. (as successor trustee to Bank One, N.A.) (the "Trustee") and the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 15, 2010 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Sixth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
     In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company (including, without limitation, the Indenture), such certificates of public officials and such other documents and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company and others, in each case, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In all such investigations and examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons executing documents and certificates submitted to us, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of original and certified documents submitted to us, the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies and that any certificate or document upon which we have relied and which was given or dated earlier than the date of this letter continues to remain accurate, insofar as relevant to the opinions contained herein, from such earlier date through and including the date hereof. As to various questions of fact relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon, and assumed the accuracy
 
of statements contained in the Indenture and any other documents executed, delivered or entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes and certificates and oral or written statements and other information of or from public officials and officers and representatives of the Company and others and assume compliance on the part of all parties to the Indenture with their covenants and agreements contained therein. We have also assumed that (i) the Trustee had and continues to have the power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) the Supplemental Indenture was duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and the Indenture constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, and that the Trustee will comply with all of its obligations under the Indenture, (iii) the Company will comply with all applicable laws, (iv) the Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto filed on or prior to the date hereof, are and remain effective, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing its use or the use of any prospectus or prospectus supplement has been or will be issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been or will be instituted or threatened by the SEC and (v) the Notes were issued and sold in compliance with and in the manner described in the Prospectus and duly authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture.
     Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes were validly authorized and issued and are binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following:
(A) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws (or related judicial doctrines) now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally;
(B) general principles of equity (including, without limitation, standards of materiality, good faith, fair dealing and reasonableness, equitable defenses and limits as to the availability of equitable remedies), whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and
(C) the application of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation, or preferential transfer law or any law governing the distribution of assets of any person now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.
     The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the States of New York and North Carolina and the federal law of the United States, each as currently in effect, and no opinion is expressed with respect to such laws as subsequently amended, or any other laws, or any effect that such amended or other laws may have on the opinions expressed herein.
