Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
On May 14, 2010, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (the "Company") received a notice required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regarding a blackout period under the Lowe's 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") in connection with a change in the recordkeeper for the Plan. On May 18, 2010, pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR, the Company sent a formal notice of the blackout period to its directors and executive officers (the "Prior Notice"), a copy of which was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 14, 2010 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 18, 2010. The Prior Notice indicated that the blackout period would begin on June 18, 2010 and end during the week of July 4, 2010 (the "Blackout Period"). The Blackout Period has been cancelled because the Company and the new recordkeeper have determined that they will need additional time to prepare for the transition.
On June 18, 2010, as required by Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR, the Company sent an updated notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that the Blackout Period has been cancelled and explaining the reason for such cancellation (the "Updated Notice"). A copy of the Updated Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
The purpose of this updated notice is to inform you that the "blackout period" described in the notice that was delivered to you on May 18, 2010 (the "Prior Notice") has been cancelled. The Prior Notice indicated that the blackout period, which was required because of the conversion to a new recordkeeper for the Lowe's 401(k) Plan, would begin on June 18, 2010 and end during the week of July 4, 2010. The blackout period has been cancelled because the Company and the new recordkeeper have decided to postpone the transition to provide additional time to prepare. Once a new date for the transition in recordkeepers has been determined, we will notify you of the new blackout period that will apply.
Please remember that notwithstanding the cancellation of the blackout period and the lifting of the trading restrictions imposed under Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR, you are subject to the other restrictions on trading activity under the Company's Insider Trading Policy. In order to avoid any inadvertent violations of those restrictions, you should continue to direct questions about, and requests for pre-clearance of, your transactions in the Company's securities to me at (704) 758-2250, or in writing, at Lowe's Companies, Inc., 1000 Lowe's Boulevard, Mooresville, North Carolina 28117
