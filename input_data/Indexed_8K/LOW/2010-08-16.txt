-- Second Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increased 1.6 Percent --
   Lowes Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the worlds second largest home improvement retailer, today reported net earnings of $832 million for the quarter ended July 30, 2010, a 9.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.  Diluted earnings per share increased 13.7 percent to $0.58 from $0.51 in the second quarter of 2009.  For the six months ended July 30, 2010, net earnings increased 7.0 percent to $1.32 billion while diluted earnings per share increased 9.5 percent to $0.92.
MOORESVILLE, N.C.
Sales for the quarter increased 3.7 percent to $14.4 billion, up from $13.8 billion in the second quarter of 2009.  For the six months ended July 30, 2010, sales increased 4.2 percent to $26.7 billion.  Comparable store sales for the second quarter increased 1.6 percent and for the first half of 2010 increased 2.0 percent.
Despite economic uncertainty, our continued focus on the customer and prudent expense management yielded solid results for the quarter, said Robert A. Niblock, Lowes chairman and CEO. With limited visibility into near-term demand, we continue to focus on operational efficiency to create value for our shareholders.  Longer-term, we believe improvements in labor and housing markets will be necessary to support more consistent improvement in demand for home improvement products.
 
 
During the quarter, Lowes opened four stores and closed one.  As of July 30, 2010, Lowes operated 1,724 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico representing 194.6 million square feet of retail selling space, a 2.0 percent increase over last year.
A conference call to discuss second quarter 2010 operating results is scheduled for today (Monday, August 16) at 9:00 am EDT.  The conference call will be available through a webcast and can be accessed by visiting Lowes website at www.Lowes.com/investor and clicking on Lowes Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call Webcast.  A replay of the call will be archived on Lowes.com until November 14, 2010.
