Comparable store sales increased 1.1 percent for the fourth quarter and increased 1.3 percent for fiscal 2010.
We delivered solid results for the quarter, including earnings that exceeded our guidance, commented Robert A. Niblock, Lowe's chairman and CEO.  I would like to thank our more than 234,000 employees who worked diligently and executed well through the holiday season and difficult winter weather.  Because of their efforts, we grew comparable store sales and gross margin while leveraging expenses. 
While uncertainty in the market remains, the economic recovery is continuing, Niblock added.  We are committed to delivering better customer experiences and expect to grow market share in 2011 as we make continued progress on our key initiatives.
During the quarter, Lowes opened 17 stores and closed two.  As of January 28, 2011, Lowes operated 1,749 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico representing 197.1 million square feet of retail selling space, a 2.0 percent increase over last year.
A conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2010 operating results is scheduled for today (Wednesday, February 23) at 9:00 am ET.
