(b)           On March 17, 2011, Robert A. Ingram, who has served on the Board of Directors of Lowes Companies, Inc. (the Company) since 2001, notified the Board that he will not stand for re-election as a director at the end of his current term expiring at the Companys 2011 annual meeting of shareholders (the Annual Meeting) in order to devote more time to other professional commitments requiring increasing amounts of his time.   Mr. Ingrams decision was not the result of any disagreement with the Company or its management.
 
The Board of Directors intends to reduce its size to 10 members to be effective on the date of the Annual Meeting to be held on May 27, 2011.
