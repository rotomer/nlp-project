On April 23, 2012, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (the "Company") issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion of unsecured notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.625% notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.120% notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.650% notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were issued under an amended and restated indenture, dated as of December 1, 1995, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor trustee) (the "Trustee") (the "Base Indenture"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K on December 15, 1995, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, dated as of April 23, 2012, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Senior Indenture"), which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.
The Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Senior Indenture contains covenants restricting the issuance of debt by the Company's subsidiaries but does not restrict the Company from incurring additional indebtedness. The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Company does not intend to apply for the listing of any series of the Notes on a national securities exchange or for quotation of any series of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system.
The 2017 Notes mature on April 15, 2017 and bear interest at a rate of 1.625% per annum; the 2022 Notes mature on April 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 3.120% per annum and the 2042 Notes mature on April 15, 2042 and bear interest at a rate of 4.650% per annum. The Company will pay interest on the Notes on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2012. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Payments of principal and interest to owners of book-entry interests are expected to be made in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company and its participants in effect from time to time.
Before the date that is one month (with respect to the 2017 Notes), three months (with respect to the 2022 Notes) or six months (with respect to the 2042 Notes) prior to the applicable maturity date for such series of Notes, the Notes of each series will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), plus 15 basis points with respect to the 2017 Notes, 20 basis points with respect to the 2022 Notes and 25 basis points with respect to the 2042 Notes; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
On or after the date that is one month (with respect to the 2017 Notes), three months (with respect to the 2022 Notes) or six months (with respect to the 2042 Notes) prior to the applicable maturity date for such series of Notes, the Notes of each series will be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option at par plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
If a change of control triggering event occurs (certain negative ratings repercussions as a result of certain changes in control of the Company, as described more fully in the Supplemental Indenture), the Company will be required to offer to purchase the Notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest unless the Company has previously exercised its option to redeem the Notes.
The Trustee and/or its affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company, or its affiliates, including investment banking services and acting as lenders under various loan facilities. They have received or will receive customary fees, commissions or other payments for these transactions.
The foregoing description of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents.
 
The Company issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes, which are governed by the Senior Indenture, in an underwritten public offering on April 23, 2012.
Additional information included in Item 1.01 above and in Item 1.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on April 20, 2012 regarding the Notes is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, and the foregoing description of the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Indenture and the forms of Global Notes which are included in Exhibit 4.1 filed herewith.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Lowe's Companies, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offer and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.625% Notes due April 15, 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.120% Notes due April 15, 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.650% Notes due April 15, 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-161697) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and as described in the prospectus dated September 2, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated April 16, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"). With your permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made without any independent investigation or verification on our part except to the extent otherwise expressly stated, and we express no opinion with respect to the accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.
The Notes will be issued pursuant to and governed by an existing amended and restated indenture dated as of December 1, 1995 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor trustee to Bank One, N.A.) (the "Trustee") as supplemented by the Ninth Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 23, 2012 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Ninth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company (including, without limitation, the Indenture, resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted on March 23, 2012, and Action of Pricing Committee dated April 16, 2012, each as certified by the Secretary of the Company as of the date hereof, and the Company's Restated Charter and Bylaws, as amended and restated, each as certified by the Secretary of the Company as of the date hereof) such certificates of public officials and such other documents, and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company and others, in each case, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinions hereafter expressed. In all such investigations and examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons executing documents and certificates submitted to us, the authenticity of documents and certificates submitted to us as originals, the conformity with the original documents or certificates of all documents and certificates submitted to us as copies and that any certificate or document upon which we have relied and which was given or dated earlier than the date of this letter continues to remain accurate, insofar as relevant to the opinions contained herein, from such earlier date through and including the date hereof. As to various

We have also assumed that (a) the Trustee had and continues to have the power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) the Ninth Supplemental Indenture was duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and the Indenture constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, and that the Trustee will comply with all of its obligations under the Indenture, (c) the Company will comply with all applicable laws, (d) the Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto (including any post-effective amendments) filed on or prior to the date hereof, are and remain effective, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing its use or the use of any prospectus or prospectus supplement has been or will be issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been or will be instituted or threatened by the SEC, (e) the Indenture has been and will remain qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (f) the Notes were issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner described in the Prospectus and have been by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture, and (g) all signatures are genuine.
duly authenticated
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1.     The Notes have been authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and are binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the States of North Carolina and New York (which opinions are given by lawyers in this firm who are licensed to practice in the State of New York), each as currently in effect, and no opinion is expressed with respect to such laws as subsequently amended, or any other laws, or any effect that such amended or other laws may have on the opinions expressed herein. We disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein. We are opining only as to the matters expressly set forth in numbered paragraph 1 above, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated therein. We do not find it necessary for purposes of this opinion, and accordingly we do not purport to cover herein, the application of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of the various states to the offer and sale of the Notes.
We express no opinion as to:
(i)     the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Indenture or the Notes:
(A)     containing any purported waiver, release, variation, disclaimer, consent or other agreement of similar effect (all of the foregoing, collectively, a "Waiver") by the Company under any such agreements or instruments to the extent limited by provisions of applicable law (including judicial

decisions), or to the extent that such a Waiver applies to a right, claim, duty, defense or ground for discharge otherwise existing or occurring as a matter of law (including judicial decisions), except to the extent that such a Waiver is effective under, and is not prohibited by or void or invalid under, provisions of applicable law (including judicial decisions);
(B)     related to (I) forum selection or submission to jurisdiction (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue in any court or of any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum) to the extent that the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any such provision is to be determined by any court other than a court of the State of New York, or (II) choice of governing law to the extent that the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any such provision is to be determined by any court other than a court of the State of New York or a federal district court sitting in the State of New York, in each case, applying the choice of law principles of the State of New York;
(C)     specifying that provisions thereof may be waived only in writing, to the extent that an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created that modifies any provision of such agreement;
(D)     purporting to give any person or entity the power to accelerate obligations without any notice to the obligor; or
(E)     which may be construed to be in the nature of a penalty.
The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following:
(i)     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium (or related judicial doctrines) and other laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally;
(ii)    general principles of equity (including, without limitation, standards of materiality, good faith, fair dealing and reasonableness, equitable defenses and limits as to the availability of equitable remedies), whether such principles are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and
(iii)   the application of any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation, or preferential transfer law or any law governing the distribution of assets of any person now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the SEC and the incorporation by reference of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of such term as used in the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
Very truly yours,
