Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended March 30, 2003
FREMONT, Calif., April 16, 2003Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 30, 2003. Revenue was $187.1 million, and net income was $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share compared to revenue of $184.6 million and net income of $1.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share for the December 2002 quarter:
Ongoing net income in the March 2003 quarter, excluding certain charges, was $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, versus net income of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the December 2002 quarter. The company believes this presentation of net income, which excludes net restructuring charges, is useful for analyzing the business because it removes the effects of accelerated expense recognition connected with our outsourcing strategy and consolidation. A table that provides a reconciliation of net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to ongoing net income is included.
New orders of $192 million increased 18 percent sequentially, and production output for the period was approximately $174 million.
The geographic distribution of new orders and revenue is shown in the following table:
Gross margin for the March 2003 quarter was $75.2 million or 40.2 percent of revenue, a sequential improvement from 39.3 percent of revenue, primarily due to higher utilization levels and proactive cost management. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring items, were $72.2 million compared to $71.5 million in the December 2002 quarter, reflecting anticipated seasonal cost increases.
Operating cash generation in the period slightly exceeded $20 million and was offset by a Yen-denominated loan repayment of approximately $51 million resulting in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and restricted cash balances of $585.3 million at the end of the quarter.
"The results for the March quarter demonstrate our solid market share gains and continued focus on reducing operating expenses. This is a winning combination for Lam. Over the course of this downturn, Lam employees have driven important new customer gains, while transforming the business by implementing an aggressive outsourcing strategy. Although the industry environment is uncertain, we are confident that we will continue to deliver better solutions to our customers, which should drive better returns to our shareholders," stated James W. Bagley, chairman and chief executive officer.

Consolidated Financial Tables to Follow
Reconciliation of US GAAP Net Income to Ongoing Net Income:
(1) For the three-month period ended March 30, 2003, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options, but excludes the assumed conversion of the outstanding warrant and convertible subordinated 4% notes because the effect would have been antidilutive. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2002, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options and warrant, but excludes the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% and 5% notes because the effect would have been antidilutive. Outstanding options and convertible subordinated 4% notes for the nine-month period ended March 30, 2003, and outstanding options, warrants, and convertible subordinated 4% and 5% notes for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2002, were excluded from the computations of diluted net loss per common share because the effects would have been antidilutive due to the net losses for the periods.
