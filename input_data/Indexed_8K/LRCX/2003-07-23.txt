EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION CONTACT: Kathleen Bela, Investor Relations, phone: 510/572-4566, e-mail: kathleen.bela@lamrc.com LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 2003 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS FREMONT, Calif., July 23, 2003 -- Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended June 29, 2003. Revenue for the June 2003 quarter was $186.1 million, and net income was $3.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $187.1 million and net income of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the March 2003 quarter. The company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes the effects of significant net tax benefits and net restructuring charges, is useful for analyzing the business because it better enables comparisons for ongoing operations and removes the effects of expense recognition connected with our outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing results to results under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included. Ongoing net income in the June 2003 quarter was $2.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, versus ongoing net income of $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the March 2003 quarter. New orders of $192 million in the June 2003 quarter reached levels recorded in the prior quarter; the geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table: ~MORE~
LAM ANNOUNCES 2003 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS...........................PAGE 2 OF 6 Ongoing gross margin for the June 2003 quarter was $76.5 million, or 41.1 percent of revenue, a sequential improvement from 40.2 percent of revenue. The improved performance includes the contribution of our outsourcing strategy and other cost reduction initiatives. Ongoing operating expenses were $74.9 million compared to $72.2 million in the March 2003 quarter, the result of an increased number of working days and higher employee compensation costs. Production output for the period was approximately $175 million. Owing to focused asset management initiatives, operating cash generation in the period was approximately $32 million, driving total cash (cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash) up $41 million to $626 million at the end of the fiscal year. "The results for the June quarter highlighted our progress on a number of key metrics," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "Notably, our market share gains in dielectric etch and 300 mm contributed to a positive book-to-bill in a difficult business environment. In addition, our outsourcing initiatives and cost reduction efforts continue to improve our gross margin," continued Bagley. "Lam employees have made significant contributions to our success, and their efforts have resulted in a suite of compelling products and services for our customers, and increasing returns for our shareholders," Bagley concluded.
