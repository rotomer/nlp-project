EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION CONTACT: Kathleen Bela, Investor Relations, phone: 510/572-4566, e-mail: kathleen.bela@lamrc.com LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 26, 2004 FREMONT, Calif., October 13, 2004 -- Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended September 26, 2004. Revenue for the period was $419.5 million, and net income was $89.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $329.6 million and net income of $52.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the June 2004 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the September 2004 quarter were $214.8 million and $93.5 million, respectively. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. In the September 2004 quarter, there are no significant differences between the ongoing results and the results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The June 2004 quarter presentation removes the effects of CMP impairment charges and net gains associated with the early retirement of the Company's 4% notes and the related interest rate swap. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under GAAP are included at the end of this press release. Ongoing net income increased by 74 percent, driven by sequential revenue growth in excess of 27 percent combined with the leverage from the Company's business model. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2004 quarter was over 51 percent of revenue primarily due to volume growth, driving improved utilization of factory and field resources. In addition, the results reflect continued expense control and efficient asset management. In the period, ongoing operating expenses increased as planned to $93.5 million, primarily due to increases in variable compensation and employee benefits expenses. Ongoing net income of $89.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the September 2004 quarter compares with ongoing net income of $51.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the previous quarter. ~MORE~

"The financial results this quarter include significant achievements for the Company," stated James W. Bagley, chairman and chief executive officer of Lam. "Our gross margin percentage exceeded 51 percent, resulting in record operating margins and record net income." "While we expect wafer fab equipment to remain a growth-cyclical industry, we believe our business model provides the Company the flexibility to address changing business conditions. Although our customers' investment activity may slow, we believe our product portfolio is particularly well positioned, and we expect to expand our market share in next-generation applications. We intend to build on these financial and market successes, which we believe will result in long-term value for our shareholders, customers, and employees," Bagley concluded. ~MORE~
