Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2006
     On February 16, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established corporate performance goals for the first half of its calendar year 2006 incentive plan (the "Plan") for its named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. The Plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount.
