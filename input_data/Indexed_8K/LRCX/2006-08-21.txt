Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the Second Half of Calendar Year 2006
      On August 15, 2006, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for the second half of calendar year 2006 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin, operating profit, and cash generation targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's target incentive amount is 100% of his salary. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.55 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the Incentive Plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
      The Compensation Committee had previously established target incentive amounts and corporate performance goals for the entire calendar year 2006 for its named executive officers other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman at the Committee's meeting on February 16, 2006. Accordingly, the performance goals under the Company's calendar year 2006 incentive plan set by the Committee in February for such named executive officers continue in effect for the second half of calendar year 2006.
