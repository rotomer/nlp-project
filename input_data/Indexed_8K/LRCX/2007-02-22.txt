Item 5.02 Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2007
     On February 15, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for the first half of calendar year 2007 for Nicolas J. Bright, the Company's Executive Vice President, Regional Business and Global Products. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin and operating profit targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Bright's target incentive amount is 85% of his salary. His actual incentive award may range from zero to 2.4 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the Incentive Plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met. The performance goals established for the first half of the year shall continue for the second half of the year unless the Committee determines to revise the goals for the second half of 2007. The individual and corporate performance goals established for Mr. Bright supersede and replace the corporate performance goals previously established by the Committee on January 15, 2007 for Mr. Bright under its calendar year 2007 incentive plan for its named executive officers.
