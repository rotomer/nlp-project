Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 25, 2007. Revenue for the period was $650.3 million and net income was $164.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $633.4 million and net income of $167.3 million, or $1.15 per diluted share for the December 2006 quarter.
Gross margin of $326.2 million for the March 2007 quarter met expectations at 50.2 percent compared to gross margin of $322.9 million, or 51.0 percent, for the December 2006 quarter. Operating expenses increased as planned during the quarter to $137.3 million compared to operating expenses of $128.4 million for the December 2006 quarter, including increased equity-based compensation expense as well as salary and benefits costs supporting the Company's new product development and market share growth objectives.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2007 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.5 billion at the end of March, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $151.4 million during the quarter.

"Lam Research delivered excellent operational and financial results in the March quarter," said Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer.
"The company continues to leverage successfully both our etch market share gains and the efficiencies inherent in our business model. During the quarter we made significant progress in advancing our new product growth initiative, including product releases achieved for our 2300 Bevel Clean system, our 2300 Motif patterning system, and our Deep Silicon Etch MEMS offering. These accomplishments combined with the anticipated successful execution of our wet clean product roadmap will position Lam to serve a larger segment of the wafer fab equipment market that is benefiting from a favorable secular demand outlook for advanced integrated circuits," Newberry concluded.
