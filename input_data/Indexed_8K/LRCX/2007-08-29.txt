Lam Research Corporation Announces Request for a Hearing Before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel
FREMONT, Calif., August 29, 2007Lam Research Corporation today announced that it will request a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel in response to the receipt of a Nasdaq Staff Determination letter dated August 27, 2007 indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The letter, which the Company had expected, was issued in accordance with Nasdaq procedures due to the delayed filing of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007. Pending a decision by the Panel, Lam shares will remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
As the Company has previously disclosed, an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed of two independent board members appointed by the Board of Directors, is conducting a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The voluntary review arose after the Company's independent auditors performed auditing processes, pursuant to recent guidance from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), relating to the Company's historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of its fiscal year-end 2007 audit. The Independent Committee is working with independent outside legal counsel to complete this review as quickly as possible. At this time the review is ongoing and the Company will not be in a position to file the Form 10-K until after the completion of the review and until the Company can determine whether it needs to record any non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants.
