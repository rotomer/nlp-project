Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for Calendar Year 2008
     On March 14, 2008, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for calendar year 2008 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin, cash generation and operating profit targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's 2008 annual incentive target is set at 125% of base salary. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the incentive plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
Adoption of Multi-Year Cash Incentive Program Performance Goals
     On March 14, 2008, based on the recommendations of the Committee, the Board established performance goals and award amounts for 2008, the second calendar year of the Company's 2007/2008 Multi-Year Incentive Program ("2007 MYIP") and the first calendar year of its 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program ("2008 MYIP") for Mr. Newberry.
     The 2007 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2007 and 2008, and awards will vest and be payable in 2009. The 2008 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2008 and 2009, and awards will vest and be payable in 2010.
     The Multi-Year Incentive Programs accrue a certain percentage of the Company's ongoing operating income, which is calculated by dividing the accumulated individual target amounts by a baseline operating income figure and multiplying that result by the Company's actual ongoing operating income for each quarter. Actual Program accruals may be enhanced based upon a stock price performance factor. Actual award accruals may vary from zero to a maximum of 2.5 times the target amount depending upon the operating income and stock performance metrics, as applicable. The Board and Committee retain discretion to reduce amounts that would otherwise be accrued under the Programs.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
