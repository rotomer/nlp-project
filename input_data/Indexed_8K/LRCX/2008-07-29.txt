Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended June 29, 2008
FREMONT, Calif., July 29, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2008 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended June 29, 2008. Revenue for the period was $566.2 million, gross margin was $234.7 million and net income was $72.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $613.8 million, gross margin of $287.2 million and net income of $103.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share for the March 2008 quarter. Shipments for the June 2008 quarter were $495 million compared to $658 million during the March 2008 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the June quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments related to an accelerated integration of SEZ, a net tax benefit as the result of the successful resolution of certain foreign tax matters, foreign currency gains on the purchase of SEZ, and costs associated with its voluntary internal stock option review. The Company's March 2008 quarter excluded certain costs related to the recent acquisition of SEZ, including the foreign currency gains on the purchase and the one-time charge for in-process research and development expense as well as the costs associated with its voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating income, ongoing net income, and ongoing diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $75.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the June 2008 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $109.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the March 2008 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2008 quarter was $247.3 million or 43.7% compared to ongoing gross margin of $293.6 million, or 47.8%, for the March 2008 quarter. The sequential decline was primarily due to unfavorable customer and product mix, factory utilization levels, and inclusion of a full quarter of SEZ results. Ongoing operating expenses for the June 2008 quarter increased to $160.7 million compared with the March 2008 quarter of $148.9 million. This increase was due to the inclusion of a full quarter of SEZ.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2008 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $1.2 billion at the end of the June 2008 quarter compared to $1.0 billion at the end of the March 2008 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were $198.3 million during the June quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2008 quarter were $193.6 million and $128.3 million, respectively. At the end of the June 2008 period, the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that is not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $52 million.
"During this period of continued reductions in wafer fab equipment investment, Lam Research is leveraging its flexible business model to reduce expenses while utilizing our strong cash generation capability to allow for continued strong investments in R&D activities, both in etch and adjacent new markets, that offer the opportunity for significant long-term revenue and earnings expansion," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer.
"The largest of those new opportunities is in single-wafer clean, where we continue to make significant investments. We have created a new organization for all of our clean products by integrating SEZ together with our C3 linear clean technology and 2300 Coronus plasma bevel clean divisions. We expect the investments in our family of clean products will provide us an excellent opportunity to grow our business in a market that we expect to double in size over the next few years." Newberry concluded.
