Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 28, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., July 29, 2009 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 28, 2009. Revenue for the period was $217.8 million, gross margin was $67.8 million and net loss was $(88.5) million, or $(0.70) per diluted share, compared to revenue of $174.4 million, gross margin of $36.5 million and net loss of $(198.4) million, or $(1.58) per diluted share, for the March 2009 quarter. Shipments for the June 2009 quarter were $246 million compared to $159 million during the March 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the June 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a legal judgment, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, certain one-time contract termination costs, a net tax expense for valuation allowance, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax matters, and interest and legal fees related to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. The Company's ongoing results for the March 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a net tax expense for a change in state tax law, a net tax expense and an exchange rate gain associated with the Company's accelerated tax planning strategy, an investment impairment, and interest on Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating loss, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net loss, and ongoing net loss per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net loss was $(57.0) million, or $(0.45) per diluted share in the June 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net loss of $(89.8) million, or $(0.71) per diluted share, for the March 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2009 quarter was $67.8 million or 31.1%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $46.7 million, or 26.8%, for the March 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory and field utilization due to increased business volume. Ongoing operating expenses for the June 2009 quarter decreased to $114.3 million compared with the March 2009 quarter of $128.9 million. This decrease was driven by a full quarter savings in employee-related expenses and other cost reduction measures that were a part of the March 2009 quarter restructuring. In addition, in the March 2009 quarter, the Company recorded accounts receivable reserves for specific distressed customers that did not recur in the June 2009 quarter.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2009 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2009 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $757.8 million at the end of the June 2009 quarter, compared to $806.4 million at the end of the March 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $(58.1) million during the June 2009 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2009 quarter were $64.7 million and $45.8 million, respectively. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $13 million as of June 28, 2009.
"Relative to the March quarter, business conditions improved in the June quarter, contributing to Lam's ability to show improved financial results for the quarter. Shipments and revenues increased as a result of customer investments to add wafer starts at the leading edge in both foundry and memory, as well as higher fab utilization contributing to improvement in the customer service business," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "While we are encouraged that our customers have increased spending on equipment, we plan to maintain our focus on cash management while continuing our strategic investments in leading-edge solutions for our customers' current and next-generation wafer fabrication needs," Newberry concluded.
