Adoption of Performance Goals For Second Half of Calendar Year 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Programs
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established certain semi-annual performance factors for the second six-month period of calendar year 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2008/2009 MYIP") and the Company's 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 MYIP"), programs under the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), for certain officers of the Company, including the Company's named executive officers.
Awards under the 2008/2009 MYIP will vest, to the extent earned, and be paid in cash in 2010. Awards under the 2009/2010 MYIP will vest, to the extent earned, and be paid in cash in 2011. For the second six months of 2009, the performance factor is a metric related to ongoing operating cash flow (using the same metric that was used for the first six months of 2009). The multiplier resulting from achievement of this factor may be additionally enhanced by a stock price performance multiplier. Actual payouts may vary from 0 to 2.5 times target amounts.
Adoption of Performance Goals for Second Half of Calendar Year 2009 under the Company's Annual Incentive Program
The Committee also approved certain semi-annual performance objectives for the second six-month period of its calendar year 2009 annual incentive program (the "2009 AIP"), a program under the EIP and the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, for certain officers of the Company, including the Company's named executive officers (using the same metrics that were used for the first six months of 2009).
