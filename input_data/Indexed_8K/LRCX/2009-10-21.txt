Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 27, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., October 21, 2009Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the September 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 27, 2009. Revenue for the period was $318.5 million, gross margin was $136.8 million and net income was $16.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $217.8 million, gross margin of $67.8 million and net loss of $(88.5) million, or $(0.70) per diluted share, for the June 2009 quarter. Shipments for the September 2009 quarter were $355 million compared to $246 million during the June 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the September 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and the finalization of a portion of certain liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses. The Company's ongoing results for the June 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a legal judgment, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, certain one-time contract termination costs, a net tax expense for valuation allowance, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax matters, and interest and legal fees related to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income (loss), ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income (loss), and ongoing net income (loss) per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $4.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the September 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net loss of $(57.0) million, or $(0.45) per diluted share, for the June 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2009 quarter was $131.3 million or 41.2%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $67.8 million, or 31.1%, for the June 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory and field utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the September 2009 quarter increased to $123.3 million compared with the June 2009 quarter of $114.3 million. This increase was primarily the result of one-time credits against spending realized in the June 2009 quarter, planned additional spending on R&D programs and additional employee variable compensation as a result of higher profit levels.
