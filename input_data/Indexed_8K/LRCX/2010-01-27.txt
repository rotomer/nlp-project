Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 27, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., January 27, 2010Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 27, 2009. Revenue for the period was $487.2 million, gross margin was $223.2 million and net income was $69.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $318.5 million, gross margin of $136.8 million and net income of $16.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the September 2009 quarter. Shipments for the December 2009 quarter were $519 million compared to $355 million during the September 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities, the reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of the remaining liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses, and the impairment of an investment. The Company's ongoing results for the September 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and the reversal of accrued liabilities due to settlement of a portion of certain liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $60.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share in the December 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $4.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the September 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the December 2009 quarter was $218.5 million or 44.8%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $131.3 million, or 41.2%, for the September 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the December 2009 quarter increased to $142.3 million compared with the September 2009 quarter of $123.3 million. This increase was a function of higher variable compensation expense associated with our improvement in profitability, new product material spending to support additional market opportunities arising from an improved business outlook, and the restoration of employee salaries and accompanying benefits (excluding executive management) to levels prior to the actions to reduce base compensation in the March 2009 quarter.
