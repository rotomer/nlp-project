Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 28, 2010
FREMONT, Calif., April 21, 2010Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2010 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 28, 2010. Revenue for the period was $632.8 million, gross margin was $292.9 million and net income was $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $487.2 million, gross margin of $223.2 million and net income of $69.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the December 2009 quarter. Shipments for the March 2010 quarter were $735 million compared to $519 million during the December 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities, the reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of the remaining liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses, and the impairment of an investment. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "ongoing" results for the March 2010 quarter. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share in the March 2010 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $60.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the December 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2010 quarter was $292.9 million or 46.3%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $218.5 million, or 44.8%, for the December 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the March 2010 quarter remained essentially flat compared with the December 2009 quarter.

"The continued success of the spin-clean business, evidenced by the recent shipment of our 3,000
th
spin-clean process chamber, is complemented by our linear-clean and plasma-based bevel clean technologies. Our clean products represent a technology and productivity leadership portfolio that is advancing the success of our adjacent-market growth strategy," Newberry concluded.
