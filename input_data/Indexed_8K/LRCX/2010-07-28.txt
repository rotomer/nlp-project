Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 27, 2010
FREMONT, Calif., July 28, 2010Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2010 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 27, 2010. Revenue for the period was $695.3 million, gross margin was $321.4 million and net income was $140.0 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $632.8 million, gross margin of $292.9 million and net income of $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the March 2010 quarter. Shipments for the June 2010 quarter were $694 million compared to $735 million during the March 2010 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the June 2010 quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine ongoing results for the March 2010 quarter. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamrc.com.
Ongoing net income was $149.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share in the June 2010 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the March 2010 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2010 quarter was $324.9 million or 46.7%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $292.9 million, or 46.3%, for the March 2010 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory and field utilization and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the June 2010 quarter increased to $152.4 million compared with the March 2010 quarter of $143.8 million. This change is a result of higher R&D spending related to customer penetration activities associated with new products and increased variable compensation resulting from improved overall financial performance.

Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $165.4 million during the June 2010 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2010 quarter were $207.4 million and $123.2 million, respectively.

"Market share gains and solid execution drove strong results for the June quarter," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "We believe that we will achieve substantial shipped market share gains in both the etch and clean businesses for calendar year 2010. We continued to win important new applications in the first half of 2010 in both businesses."
"We are committed to creating value for our customers and shareholders and believe that we are demonstrating the results of that commitment through our business and financial performance," Newberry concluded.
