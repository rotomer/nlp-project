Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 26, 2010. Revenue for the period was $805.9 million, gross margin was $377.3 million, and net income was $193.7 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $695.3 million, gross margin of $321.4 million, and net income of $140.0 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the June 2010 quarter. Shipments for the September 2010 quarter were $808 million compared to $694 million during the June 2010 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the September 2010 and June 2010 quarters exclude certain costs and/or benefits for restructuring activities and asset impairments. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamrc.com.
Ongoing net income was $190.6 million, or $1.52 per diluted share in the September 2010 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $149.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for the June 2010 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2010 quarter was $377.3 million or 46.8%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $324.9 million, or 46.7%, for the June 2010 quarter. Ongoing operating expenses for the September 2010 quarter were $158.5 million compared with the June 2010 quarter of $152.4 million. This change is primarily due to increased variable compensation resulting from improved overall financial performance.

These results reflect continued market share gains in both etch and single-wafer clean while also demonstrating our ability to leverage an operating model that is scalable and cost effective in meeting customer requirements," said Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer. "We are well positioned for future growth as we expand our markets and execute to our strategy," Newberry concluded.
