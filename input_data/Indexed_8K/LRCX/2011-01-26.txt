On January 26, 2011, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") hosted a conference call announcing the Company's financial results for the quarter ended December 26, 2010. During that call, representatives of the Company inadvertently misstated the Company's earnings per share guidance for the Company's quarter ending March 27, 2011. The Company is filing this report to correct this inadvertent misstatement. The Company currently expects its earnings per share for the quarter ending March 27, 2011 to be $1.33, plus or minus $0.07 per share. The correct guidance was and is included in the slide presentation that accompanied the conference call and is posted on the Company's website. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise this guidance, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
