Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 27, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., April 20, 2011Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 27, 2011. Revenue for the period was $809.1 million, gross margin was $374.0 million (46.2%), and net income was $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $870.7 million, gross margin of $407.4 million (46.8%), and net income of $221.9 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, for the December 2010 quarter. Shipments for the March 2011 quarter were $813 million compared to $892 million during the December 2010 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2010 quarter exclude certain benefits for research and development tax credits. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "ongoing" results for the March 2011 quarter. Management uses ongoing operating income, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing net income to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamrc.com.
Ongoing net income was $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the March 2011 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $217.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for the December 2010 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2011 quarter was $374.0 million or 46.2%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $407.4 million, or 46.8%, for the December 2010 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to customer mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the March 2011 quarter were $177.0 million compared with the December 2010 quarter of $166.3 million. This change is consistent with our plans to increase investments in core product research and development as well as customer-specific programs.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.4 billion at the end of the March 2011 quarter, compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the December 2010 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $241.6 million during the March 2011 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2011 quarter were $246.6 million and $150.3 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $36.2 million as of March 27, 2011.
"Lam delivered strong performance in the March quarter providing a solid foundation for the remainder of 2011. I am particularly pleased with our solid cash generation performance, which represented a return of approximately 30% of revenues. Strong demand for smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices is expected to drive a healthy level of investment on the part of our customers over the course of CY'11," said Steve Newberry, chief executive officer and vice chairman of the board.
"These investment levels create opportunities for Lam, and we remain committed to making the strategic investments necessary to strengthen and grow our market position in both etch and clean. We have increased our level of customer engagement through joint partnerships and programs designed to improve our customers' manufacturing productivity and address their most complex technical challenges. These customer-centric programs coupled with investments in core product R&D enable Lam Research to be well-positioned for growth in the coming years."
