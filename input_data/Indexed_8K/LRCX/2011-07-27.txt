Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 26, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., July 27, 2011Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 26, 2011. Revenue for the period was $752.0 million, gross margin was $338.5 million (45.0%), and net income was $125.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $809.1 million, gross margin of $374.0 million (46.2%), and net income of $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the March 2011 quarter. Shipments for the June 2011 quarter were $793 million compared to $813 million during the March 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for the June 2011 quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring and impairments, the non-cash portion of convertible debt interest expense, and tax expense associated with legal entity restructuring. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "non-GAAP" results for the March 2011 quarter. Management uses non-GAAP operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $142.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the June 2011 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the March 2011 quarter. Gross margin for the June 2011 quarter was $338.5 million or 45.0%, compared to gross margin of $374.0 million or 46.2%, for the March 2011 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower factory and field utilization as a result of the decline in volume from the March to the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the June 2011 quarter were $179.5 million compared with the March 2011 quarter of $177.0 million and reflect our continued investments in strategic development activities.

The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.3 billion at the end of the June 2011 quarter, compared to $1.4 billion at the end of the March 2011 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $198.1 million or 26% of revenue during the June 2011 quarter. Additionally, during the quarter the Company completed a convertible debt financing and generated $835.5 million in net cash, which includes proceeds from warrant sales, offset by issuance fees and purchase of a convertible note hedge. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2011 quarter were $257.6 million and $157.2 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $70.4 million as of June 26, 2011.
"Lam delivered solid operating performance and financial results for the June quarter," said Steve Newberry, Lam's chief executive officer and vice chairman. "We are seeing significant near term declines in wafer fab equipment spending, and as result our September quarter shipments, revenues and earnings per share will be well below our June quarter results. Even in this environment, we continue to execute to our strategic priorities and make key R&D investments that position the company for future growth opportunities. Longer term, we continue to believe that on a rolling average basis, twelve-month wafer fab equipment spending should be healthy over the next several years and our outstanding product portfolio, supported by our solid balance sheet and strong cash generation capabilities enable the company to deliver increased value to our customers and our shareholders in that environment," Newberry concluded.
