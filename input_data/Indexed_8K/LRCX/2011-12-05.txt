Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 30, 2011, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") entered into Employment Agreements with Stephen G. Newberry (the "Newberry Agreement") and Martin B. Anstice (the "Anstice Agreement"). The agreements are effective as of January 1, 2012.
The summaries of the terms of the agreements that follow are qualified in their entirety by the respective texts of such agreements. The Newberry Agreement and the Anstice Agreement are attached as Exhibits 10.158 and 10.159 respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference
Newberry Agreement
The Newberry Agreement supersedes the Employment Agreement between the Company and Mr. Newberry dated January 1, 2003, as amended December 17, 2008 and the Employment Agreement dated July 1, 2009, as amended December 7, 2010. The Newberry Agreement provides that Mr. Newberry shall serve as the Company's Vice Chairman, for a term commencing on January 1, 2012 and ending on December 31, 2014, subject to the right of the Company or Mr. Newberry, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Newberry Agreement prior to December 31, 2014, and provided that Mr. Newberry's employment under the Newberry Agreement will terminate upon his death or "disability," as defined in the Newberry Agreement.
Under the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry will receive a base salary of $500,000 per year, subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Board. That amount will be paid solely in cash during 2012, and during 2013 and 2014 will be paid partially in cash, and partially in restricted stock units, as described in the Newberry Agreement. Mr. Newberry will continue to vest in his current 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but he will not be eligible for future awards under the Company's short-term or long term variable compensation plans. Mr. Newberry will receive other benefits, such as health insurance, vacation, and other benefit plans and compensation programs generally applicable to executive officers of the Company. He will be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred in the performance of his duties and will receive a reasonable level of administrative support.
If a "change in control" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of Mr. Newberry's employment under the Newberry Agreement, and if there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of Mr. Newberry's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's Base Compensation; (2) if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated ; (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; (4) vesting, as of the date of termination, of the unvested portions of any stock option or restricted stock unit awards granted to Mr. Newberry prior to the change in control, and issuance of shares underlying any restricted stock units ("RSUs") within 10 days of the date of termination with generally a two year exercise period applicable to any stock options; and (5) payment of any amounts accrued as of the last full completed quarter as of the change in control under any long-term cash-based variable compensation plans (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry) of the Company (the "Long Term Plans"), plus an amount equal to the remaining target amount under the Long Term Plans.
If Mr. Newberry is involuntarily terminated other than in connection with a change in control, he will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's base salary, plus (2) if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated; and (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs that were granted 12 months or more before the termination date, in an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award; and any Long Term Plans (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry) which are accrued as of the last full completed quarter prior to the termination date, paid within ten days.
In the event of Mr. Newberry's death or disability, he (or his estate) will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's Base Compensation less, in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, certain insurance payments, and, if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated plus; (2) payment of certain accrued but unpaid amounts under
Table of Contents
any Long Term Plan (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry); (3) medical benefits (in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, benefits to which Mr. Newberry's dependents are entitled); and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs, in an amount equal to the greater of 50% of such awards or an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award.
In the event of any other termination of Mr. Newberry's employment during the term of the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to payment of any earned but unpaid base salary, any accrued and unused vacation, and reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Company. If Mr. Newberry voluntarily resigns, he will be entitled to no additional benefits (except as he may be eligible for under the Executive Retiree Medical Plan), any unvested stock options will be cancelled 90 days after the date of termination unless earlier exercised, and any RSUs will be cancelled on the date of termination.
The Newberry Agreement subjects Mr. Newberry to customary confidentiality and non-competition obligations during the term of the Newberry Agreement, and non-solicitation obligations for a period of six months following the termination of his employment.
Anstice Agreement
The terms of the Anstice Agreement are substantively similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, with the following material differences:
The Anstice Agreement provides that Mr. Anstice shall serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Under the Anstice Agreement, Mr. Anstice will receive a base salary of $665,000, subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Independent Members of the Board. Mr. Anstice will not receive a portion of his base salary in restricted stock units for 2013 and 2014 but will be eligible for future awards under the Company's Short Term and Long Term Plans.
The severance terms of the Anstice Agreement are generally similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, provided that (1) Mr. Anstice will receive 18 months' base salary instead of 12 months' Base Compensation in the event of his involuntary termination, whether or not in connection with a change in control; and (2) in the event of death or disability, neither Mr. Anstice nor his estate will be entitled to any payment based on Mr. Anstice's Base Compensation; and (3) for stock options granted prior to July 1, 2009, the grant agreements will control how long the stock options remain exercisable.

Exhibit 10.158
Stephen G. Newberry Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Stephen G. Newberry (the "Vice Chairman") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Vice Chairman desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Vice Chairman's employment with the Company, which supersedes the Employment Agreements between the parties dated January 1, 2003 as amended December 17, 2008 (the "Original Agreement") and the Employment Agreement effective July 1, 2009, as amended (the "Second Agreement").
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Vice Chairman by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Vice Chairman shall serve as the Vice Chairman of the Company, and in such capacity the Vice Chairman shall perform the duties and responsibilities as Vice Chairman of the Company, including: (i) working with the Company's Chief Executive Officer and senior management team; (ii) periodically meeting with customers and investors; and (iii) other duties and as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Vice Chairman, in all cases to be consistent with Vice Chairman's position.
Position
(b) . Vice Chairman shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall not devote substantial business efforts and time to another for profit company except as authorized by the lead independent Director. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Vice Chairman from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company, such as serving on the Board of Directors of another for profit company.
Vice Chairman's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Vice Chairman for the period commencing on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will not be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Vice Chairman's
Termination
employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
(i) . The Company may terminate the Vice Chairman's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Vice Chairman thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Vice Chairman's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Vice Chairman's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Vice Chairman ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Vice Chairman the compensation Vice Chairman would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Vice Chairman's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Vice Chairman. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Vice Chairman may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Vice Chairman may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Vice Chairman, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Vice Chairman during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Vice Chairman
(c) . The Vice Chairman's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Vice Chairman's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Vice Chairman gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Vice Chairman has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $500,000. For 2012, such amount will be paid solely in cash. For 2013 and 2014, the Vice Chairman will receive a portion of his compensation in restricted stock units, as described in Section 3(c) below, and a portion of his compensation as a cash retainer for Vice Chairman's service as a Director. The cash retainer will be in the same amount, and payable at the same time, as non-employee Directors. In 2013 and 2014, the cash portion of the Vice Chairman's base compensation will be determined by subtracting the restricted stock unit grant value and the cash retainer from the annual base compensation rate. All cash base compensation will be payable in regular installments in accordance with normal Company payroll. In addition, Vice Chairman will be entitled to such increases in Vice Chairman's base compensation, if any, as may be determined from time to time in the sole discretion of the Board. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation." During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall serve as a member of the Board without additional compensation.
Base Compensation
(b) . Vice Chairman shall not be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board. Vice Chairman will continue to vest in his current 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan but will not be eligible for future awards under the Combined Plans.
Variable Compensation
(c) . In 2013 and 2014, the Vice Chairman will receive a portion of his compensation as a restricted stock unit grant. For 2013, the restricted stock unit grant will have a value equal to one-half of the grant value of the annual non-employee director restricted stock unit award and, for 2014, the restricted stock unit grant will have a value equal to the grant value of the annual non-employee director restricted stock unit award. In these cases, the number of shares underlying the restricted stock units shall be determined by dividing (x) the grant value by (y) the price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant (which may be a closing price or an average price over a designated period, determined in the same manner as calculated for the Company's non-employee directors). The Vice Chairman's restricted stock units will be granted on the same date, and have the same terms, as restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors of the Company for his service as a Director. Vice Chairman shall not be entitled to receive any other stock option grants or other equity based compensation except as may be granted to him in the discretion of the independent members of the Board.
Restricted Stock Units
(d) . The Vice Chairman shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
 
(e) . During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, equity award, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board or the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program, as appropriate.
Benefits
(f) . The Company shall reimburse the Vice Chairman for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Vice Chairman in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement. Reasonable and necessary business expenses shall include travel expenses between Vice Chairman's principal location of employment (Montana and Cabo San Lucas) and Company headquarters as well as travel to other locations on Company business.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
(g) . During the Employment Period, the Company will provide the Vice Chairman with a reasonable level of administrative support acceptable to the Vice Chairman. This may either be provided by the Company directly or may be reimbursed by the Company pursuant to appropriately incurred expenses by the Vice Chairman.
Administrative Support
4. . Vice Chairman and the Company, to the extent applicable, agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to the Vice Chairman, to structure payment of all amounts of Vice Chairman's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Vice Chairman's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
 
 
 
 
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Vice Chairman a lump sum equal to twelve (12) months of Base Compensation.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman, not later than March 15, 2012, the full amount he would have earned under such 2011 plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) The Vice Chairman will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan, or if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Vice Chairman qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Vice Chairman prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. The stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms, or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs to the Vice Chairman within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which would potentially include only the 2011/2012, if unpaid, Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Vice Chairman, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control plus the Remaining Target Amount (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Vice Chairman.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Vice Chairman's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
 
a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Vice Chairman within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Vice Chairman's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Vice Chairman shall receive the Payment Amounts when ordinarily paid out.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Vice Chairman has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Vice Chairman's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Vice Chairman's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Vice Chairman with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Vice Chairman by the Company, regardless of whether the Vice Chairman's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Vice Chairman is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Vice Chairman is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control

In the event of any termination of Vice Chairman's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman all of the Vice Chairman's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Vice Chairman (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Vice Chairman for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Vice Chairman in connection with the business of the Company. These payments shall be made promptly at the Company's next scheduled payroll date.

(b) . "Disability" shall mean that the Vice Chairman is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reasons of any readily determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuing period of not less than twelve (12) months.

(ii) a material reduction in the Vice Chairman's Base Compensation and benefits package, other than a reduction in Base Compensation which is part of, and generally consistent with, a general reduction of salaries of all executive officers of the Company and of any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control, or other than a change in Vice Chairman's benefits package that continues to provide Vice Chairman with comparable benefits to those enjoyed prior to the change;
(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Vice Chairman's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, (B) any such reduction resulting from a drop in the Company's stock price or (C) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (C) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits and the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, if unpaid), and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) associated with that award;

(C) Except with respect to an event described in Section 7(c)(v), the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination only if and to the extent that (x) within 90 days of the occurrence of the events giving rise to an Involuntary Termination, the Vice Chairman provides written notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail such facts which Vice Chairman believes constitute Involuntary Termination, (y) any circumstances constituting Involuntary Termination remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following the Company's receipt of such written notice, and (z) the Termination Date occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the initial existence of the event giving rise to an Involuntary Termination.
(d) . "Termination Date" shall mean:

If more than one Termination Date may apply, then the priority provisions of Section 2(e) of this Agreement shall determine which Termination Date controls. The Company and the Vice Chairman shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.
(e) . "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:

(iii) The stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior hereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets (other than to a subsidiary or subsidiaries); or
(iv) Any other event as determined by the independent members of the Board, in the sole discretion of the independent members of the Board.

In the case of the Company, notices sent by courier shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of its Chief Legal Officer.

Notice of Termination
10. .
Non-Compete; Non-Solicit
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Vice Chairman's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Vice Chairman's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.
 
(b) The Vice Chairman agrees that prior to the Termination Date, the Vice Chairman will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (1) render any planning, marketing or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (2) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 2% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any Successor Company and any other corporation or entity of which the Vice Chairman may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any Successor Company.
(c) Prior to the Termination Date, and for the period extending six (6) months thereafter, the Vice Chairman will not directly induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Company to leave its employ and join any Restricted Business in or within 50 miles of Fremont, California.
(d) The Vice Chairman agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if he were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Vice Chairman hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 10 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
11. .
Existing Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreements
Vice Chairman represents and warrants (1) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Vice Chairman is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (2) to the best of Vice Chairman's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Vice Chairman's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Vice Chairman reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Vice Chairman further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
12. .
Arbitration
 
At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Vice Chairman's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Vice Chairman agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Vice Chairman shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Vice Chairman and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Vice Chairman shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Vice Chairman, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Vice Chairman shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Vice Chairman, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
 
(a) . The Vice Chairman shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Vice Chairman may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Vice Chairman and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Vice Chairman). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Vice Chairman, or the Vice Chairman's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Original and Second Agreements shall be superseded by this Agreement effective January 1, 2012. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Vice Chairman pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Vice Chairman for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Vice Chairman to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Vice Chairman be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Vice Chairman under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Vice Chairman shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Whole Agreement; Amendment
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
 
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Vice Chairman's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Vice Chairman is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Vice Chairman are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Vice Chairman's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Vice Chairman's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Vice Chairman in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Vice Chairman with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Vice Chairman on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Vice Chairman's termination of employment shall refer to Vice Chairman's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Vice Chairman during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Vice Chairman in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Vice Chairman is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Vice Chairman.
Assignment by Company
 
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Vice Chairman agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Vice Chairman's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Exhibit 10.159
Martin B. Anstice Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Martin B. Anstice (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company, which supersedes the Employment Agreement between the parties effective July 1, 2009, as amended (the "Original Agreement").
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's office and position.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The Board will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the Board provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).

(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.

Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $665,000.

Reimbursement of Business Expenses
4. .

2
, then:
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum equal to (A) eighteen (18) months of Base Compensation (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in effect), plus (B) an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount"), plus (C) a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15

The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date. If the Executive does not qualify for participation in the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay in a lump sum any COBRA premiums the Executive would be required to pay for the COBRA benefits selected by Executive for twelve (12) months after the Executive's Termination Date.
 
 
 
 
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date.

For options granted prior to July 1, 2009, the grant's award agreement shall control how long the options shall remain exercisable
3

(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.

Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
 
 
 
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).

For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any Successor Company and any other corporation or entity of which the Executive may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any Successor Company.
(c) Prior to the Termination Date, and for the period extending six (6) months thereafter, the Executive will not directly induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Company to leave its employ and join any Restricted Business in or within 50 miles of Fremont, California.
(d) The Executive agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if he were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration,
 
geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 10 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
11. .
Existing Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreements
Executive represents and warrants (1) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Executive is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (2) to the best of Executive's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Executive's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Executive reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Executive further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
12. .
Arbitration
At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to
 
the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the "Original Agreement" shall be superseded by this Agreement effective January 1, 2012. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a
 
"deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.
