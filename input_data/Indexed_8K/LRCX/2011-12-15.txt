Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 14, 2011, Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Lam"), and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Lam ("Merger Sub") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Novellus Systems, Inc., a California corporation ("Novellus"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Novellus (the "Merger"), with Novellus continuing as the surviving corporation ("Surviving Corporation") and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lam.
As a result of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Novellus will be converted into the right to receive 1.125 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Lam common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustment, (ii) each issued and outstanding option to acquire shares of Novellus' common stock issued under any equity compensation plan of Novellus, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option (A) exercisable for that number of shares of Lam common stock equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Novellus common stock for which such option was exercisable multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (B) with an exercise price per share equal to (x) the per share exercise price of such Novellus stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; and (iii) each outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to shares of common stock granted pursuant to any equity compensation plan of Novellus, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a restricted stock unit, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such restricted stock unit, with respect to the number of shares of Lam common stock that is equal to the number of shares of Novellus common stock subject to the restricted stock unit immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share). Holders of Novellus common stock prior to the merger will receive cash in the merger in lieu of fractional shares of Lam common stock.
Each of Lam and Novellus have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct their respective operations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice between the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and (ii) not to solicit proposals relating to alternate transactions during such period and not to engage in discussions concerning or furnish non-public information in connection with such alternative transactions. In addition, Lam and Novellus made certain other customary covenants, including, among others and subject to certain exceptions, (A) in the case of Lam, to cause a stockholders meeting to be held to consider approval of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, in the case of Novellus, to cause a shareholders meeting to be held to consider adopting the Merger Agreement and (B) in the case of Lam, for its board of directors to recommend approval by Lam's stockholders of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and in the case of Novellus, for its board of directors to recommend adoption by Novellus shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement by Novellus' shareholders, (ii) approval by Lam's stockholders of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) approval for listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market of the Lam common stock to be issued in the Merger; (iv) expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period; (v) absence of laws, orders, judgments and injunctions that restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger; (vi) effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933 of the Form S-4 registration statement relating to the issuance of the Lam common stock in the Merger and absence of any stop order in respect thereof or proceedings by the SEC for that purpose; (vii) the receipt of certain tax opinions regarding the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; (viii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses of Lam and Novellus and compliance by Lam and Novellus with their respective covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; and (ix) the number of shareholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Lam and Novellus and further provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Lam may be required to pay Novellus, or Novellus may be required to pay Lam, a termination fee of $120,000,000.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by this reference.
Richard Hill, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Novellus, has agreed, among other things, to vote his shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms of a voting agreement entered into with Lam (the "Voting Agreement"). The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, a form of which is filed as Exhibits 10.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by this reference.
This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. In connection with the proposed merger, Lam intends to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of Lam and Novellus that also constitutes a prospectus of Lam. Lam and Novellus will furnish the joint proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to their respective security holders in connection with the proposed merger of Lam and Novellus. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION, WE URGE SECURITY HOLDERS AND INVESTORS TO READ THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (INCLUDING ALL AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LAM AND NOVELLUS AND THE PROPOSED MERGER. The proposals for the merger will be made solely through the joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, a copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it becomes available) may be obtained free of charge from Lam Research Corporation, Investor Relations, 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, CA 94538-6401, or from Novellus Systems, Inc., Investor Relations, 4000 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95134. Security holders will be able to obtain, free of charge, copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and S-4 Registration Statement and any other documents filed by Lam or Novellus with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov, and at the companies' websites at www.lamresearch.com and www.novellus.com, respectively.
This announcement contains, or may contain, "forward-looking statements" concerning Lam and Novellus (together such companies and their subsidiaries being the "Merged Company"), which are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "may," "should," "could," and other future-oriented terms identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following: (i) the expected benefits of the Merger and the repurchase program, the expected accretive effect of the Merger and the repurchase program on the Merged Company's financial results, expected cost, revenue, technology and other synergies, the expected impact for customers, employees and end-users, future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, economic performance, financial condition, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Lam's or Novellus's operations; (iii) the effects of government regulation on Lam's, Novellus's or the Merged Company's business; (iv) future industry developments and trends; (v) the anticipated timing of shareholder meetings and completion of the proposed merger and the repurchase program; and (vi) assumptions underlying any of the foregoing statements.
These forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of Lam and Novellus and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond Lam's and Novellus's ability to control or estimate precisely and include, without limitation: the ability to obtain governmental or stockholder approvals of the Merger or to satisfy other conditions to the Merger on the proposed terms and timeframe; the possibility that the Merger does not close when expected or at all, or that the companies may be required to modify aspects of the Merger to achieve regulatory approval; the ability to realize the expected synergies or other benefits from the transaction in the amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; the potential harm to customer, supplier, employee and other relationships caused by the announcement or closing of the Merger; the ability to integrate Novellus's and Lam's businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner; uncertainties in the global economy and credit markets; unanticipated trends with respect to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry; and rates of change in, future shipments, margins, market share, capital expenditures, revenue and operating expenses generally; volatility in quarterly results and in the stock price of the Merged Company; customer requirements and the ability to satisfy those requirements; customer capital spending and their demand for the Merged Company's products; the ability to defend the Merged Company's market share and to gain new market share; anticipated growth in the industry and the total market for wafer-fabrication and support equipment and the Merged Company's growth relative to such growth; levels of research and development ("R&D") expenditures; the estimates made, and the accruals recorded, in order to implement critical accounting policies (including but not limited to the adequacy of prior tax payments, future tax liabilities and the adequacy of the Merged Company's accruals relating to them); access to capital markets; the ability to manage and grow the Merged Company's cash position; the sufficiency of the Merged Company's financial resources to support future business activities (including but not limited to the repurchase program, operations, investments, debt service requirements and capital expenditures); inventory levels and inventory valuation adjustments; the impact of legal proceedings; unexpected shipment delays which adversely impact shipment volumes; inaccuracies related to the timing and satisfaction of remaining obligations related to vacated leases; the inability to recover the amortized cost of investments in auction-rate securities, market changes negatively affecting auction-rate securities and the government's inability to guarantee the underlying securities; the inability to enforce the Merged Company's patents and protect its trade secrets; and other risks and uncertainties, including those detailed from time to time in Lam's and Novellus's periodic reports (whether under the caption Risk Factors or Forward Looking Statements or elsewhere). Neither Lam nor Novellus can give any assurance that such forward-looking statements will prove to have been correct. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Neither Lam nor Novellus nor any other person undertakes any obligation to update or revise publicly any of the forward-looking statements set out herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a forecast, projection or estimate of the future financial performance of Lam, Novellus, or the Merged Company, following the implementation of the Merger or otherwise. No statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that the earnings per share, profits, margins or cash flows of Lam or the Merged Company for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published figures.
The directors and executive officers of Novellus and Lam may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the approval of the proposed transaction. Lam plans to file the registration statement that includes the joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC in connection with the solicitation of proxies to approve the proposed transaction. Information regarding Lam's directors and executive officers and their respective interests in Lam by security holdings or otherwise is available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2011 and its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on September 19, 2011. Information regarding Novellus's directors and executive officers and their respective interests in Novellus by security holdings or otherwise is available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2011 and its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 8, 2011. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants is or will be included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement, and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC, when they become available, including in connection with the solicitation of proxies to approve the proposed transaction and to elect directors.
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by Lam and Novellus to, and solely for the benefit of, each other. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure letters provided by the parties to each other in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. While Lam does not believe that these disclosure letters contain information that the securities laws require the parties to publicly disclose, other than information that has already been so disclosed, they do contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement. You should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Lam or Novellus, since they were only made as of the date of the Merger Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure letters. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Lam and Novellus rather than establishing matters as facts. Finally, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the companies' public disclosures.

FREMONT, Calif., and SAN JOSE, Calif., December 14, 2011  Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Novellus Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVLS) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion. The combined enterprise, which will retain the name of Lam Research Corp., will be a semiconductor equipment company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products and multiple opportunities to drive value creation through significant revenue and cost synergies. Total cost synergies are expected to be approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, Lam announced a $1.6 billion common stock repurchase program. This new program, which replaces Lam's existing share repurchase program, is targeted to be executed over the 12 months following the close of the transaction. Lam expects the transaction to be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings within one year after transaction close.
Lam Research and Novellus Systems are among the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, both companies playing a pivotal role in defining the features and capabilities of next-generation devices. The two companies possess complementary product capabilities, with Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligning with Novellus's leadership in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies. The combined company will be well-positioned to lead the industry through critical technology transitions including 3D structures in advanced logic and NAND memory as well as the scaling to 450 mm wafers. The combined company will also be positioned to grow revenue at a faster rate than either company could achieve individually by:
 
 
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Novellus stockholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam Research common stock for each share of Novellus that they own, in a tax-free exchange. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share. Upon closing, Lam and Novellus stockholders will own approximately 59 percent and 41 percent, respectively, of the combined company.
Lam's $1.6 billion stock repurchase program will be funded from the combined company's existing on-shore cash and on-shore cash generation. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48 percent cash.
"This strategic combination positions Lam Research to lead the development of next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technology and productivity solutions at a time when growing semiconductor demand and increased device complexity are creating significant business opportunities," said Steve Newberry, vice chairman and chief executive officer of Lam Research. "Novellus's strong capabilities and market leadership in deposition and surface preparation technologies enable Lam to become more deeply entrenched in critical semiconductor manufacturing processes that are important to our customers. We believe the adjacency of our process technologies will provide significant technical benefits that will enable us to achieve greater success together and accelerate our growth."
Richard Hill, chairman and chief executive officer of Novellus, said, "We believe the combination of Lam and Novellus is great news for our customers, investors and employees. The complementary skills, technologies and product offerings of Lam and Novellus will create a strong platform for delivering innovative and cost-effective solutions. For our investors, it presents an ability to participate in the combined company's future value creation potential."
Martin Anstice, who, as previously announced, will assume the position of CEO of Lam Research from Steve Newberry effective January 1, 2012, will continue as CEO following the close of the transaction. He is currently Lam's president and chief operating officer. Timothy Archer, chief operating officer of Novellus, will become chief operating officer of the combined company; and Ernest Maddock, chief financial officer of Lam, will remain chief financial officer. The board of directors of Lam will add four new directors jointly nominated by Lam and Novellus.
Anstice said, "We are excited to join forces with a remarkable company like Novellus. We believe that the people, products and technology that Novellus brings to Lam Research will position the combined company to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, realize significant operating efficiencies, and deliver stockholder value. Together, we believe that we will be able to optimize technology and product roadmaps, strengthen our competitive position in the market, and leverage complementary customer relationships to accelerate growth."
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Lam's and Novellus's stockholders and review by U.S. and international regulators. The companies expect the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by both Lam's and Novellus's boards of directors, to close in the second calendar quarter of 2012.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as the exclusive financial advisor, and Jones Day acted as legal counsel to Lam. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as the exclusive financial advisor, and Morrison & Foerster LLP acted as legal counsel to Novellus.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
Today we announced that Lam Research and Novellus Systems have signed an agreement to merge, creating a semiconductor equipment company with a broader portfolio of key market-leading products and technology. This is an extraordinary development, and we're excited to share our thoughts on what this means for our future.
With $1.5 billion in revenue, Novellus is a leader in advanced thin-film deposition and wafer surface preparation technologies. Lam has had a long-term relationship with Novellus, working together on programs to advance new applications and process technologies. Novellus has offices and facilities around the world in many of the same places where we do business.
Together, Lam and Novellus will be able to grow and scale in incredible ways. Novellus's technical core competencies align with Lam's strengths in etch and single-wafer clean. Lam and Novellus' customer relationships with leading global semiconductor manufacturers are closely aligned and complementary, providing an opportunity to grow revenues faster. In short, the combination will create a dynamic equipment company well-positioned to lead the industry through the next critical technology transitions including 3D structures in advanced logic and memory as well as scaling to 450 mm wafers.
We believe that Lam and Novellus employees share similar values, an innovative spirit, and strong cultural alignment. Both management teams are fully committed to integrating and developing the right organizational structure necessary to execute on our combined growth strategies.
As for next steps, our Board of Directors has voted unanimously in favor of this merger, and, subject to the customary closing conditions including approval by Lam and Novellus' shareholders, we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2012.
Until the merger is completed, Lam and Novellus will operate as independent companies. While the integration planning is underway, your focus on and support of Lam's ongoing business and customer requirements should not change. In the upcoming months, your continued practice of and belief in Lam's Core Values will help ensure a smooth integration.
We realize that you will have further questions, so we will do our best to keep you updated throughout the process. Tomorrow, Rick Hill, Novellus Chairman and CEO, and Martin will hold meetings for directors and above in Fremont and San Jose. Tim Archer, Novellus Chief Operating Officer, and Steve will hold a similar meeting in Tualatin, Oregon, where Novellus has its primary manufacturing facility. Directors will be scheduling All Hands meetings within their organizations.
 
 
 
An Employee Frequently Asked Questions document is available on the intranet along with a SharePoint site where you can post questions and/or comments (click here). A video of Martin's meeting with Directors will be posted later tomorrow in the same location.
This is a unique opportunity to join two outstanding organizations into one transformative company. We can learn a lot from each other. Together with Novellus, we'll take the company to greater heights.
Steve and Martin

Frequently Asked Questions
Rationale and Key Questions
December 14, 2011
 
 
 
Lam and Novellus are announcing a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which they will be combined in a $3.3 billion all-stock transaction.
 
The combination of Lam and Novellus creates a semiconductor equipment company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products and offering technical expertise in its core competencies. Both companies are among the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, both playing a pivotal role in defining the features and capabilities of semiconductor devices.
The two companies present complementary product capabilities, with Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligning with Novellus' leadership in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies. The combined company will be well positioned to lead the industry through the next critical transitions in semiconductor manufacturing, including 3D structures in advanced logic and NAND memory as well as the scaling to 450 mm wafers.
 
The newly combined entity will retain the name Lam Research.
 
Novellus is the world's eighth-largest semiconductor equipment manufacturer, specializing in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologiesboth critical functions in manufacturing semiconductor chips. Novellus is a market leader in CVD, ECD and dry strip technologies. It also has a group selling surface preparation equipment into industrial applications. Its primary competitors include Applied Materials, ASMI and Mattson Technologies.
 
Lam is the world's fourth-largest semiconductor equipment maker, specializing in plasma etch and single-wafer clean technologies which also play a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing. Lam is the market-share leader in etch, and holds the No. 2 position in wafer cleaning.
 
 
 
This is an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Novellus stockholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam common stock for each share of Novellus that they own. Based on Lam's closing price on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at $44.42 per share of Novellus common stock. Upon closing, Lam and Novellus stockholders will own approximately 59 percent and 41 percent, respectively, of the combined company. In conjunction with the transaction, Lam Research has authorized a $1.6 billion share repurchase program.
 
Today's industry dynamics make the timing of this transaction critical. Our customers are facing unprecedented technology challenges driven by increased process complexity and increasing manufacturing costs with each subsequent technology node. As a combined entity, we will be able to leverage our technology adjacencies to more quickly deliver solutions addressing our customers' technology and productivity challenges.
Moreover, the combination better positions Lam to address the industry's expected migration to 3D device technology and to 450 mm wafers. The transition to 450 mm technology is an expensive proposition for equipment makers. By leveraging adjacent technologies and integrating R&D resources, we can make this transition more cost effective.
 
Novellus is a leader in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies, with specific expertise in chemical vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition, ultraviolet thermal processing and dry strip equipment. Novellus has leading market share positions in chemical vapor deposition, dry strip and copper electron-chemical deposition.
Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligns well with Novellus' technology. Combining the expertise of adjacent process steps provides technical benefits that enhance the company's ability to bring innovative and cost-effective solutions to market in a timely manner. The combined company will have a broad portfolio of market-leading products and will be strongly positioned to lead the industry in the development of next-generation technology.
 
 
 
The company's product lines cover adjacent steps in the wafer fabrication process. The products are complementary and give the combined company the ability to provide more holistic solutions to the market. The broader product portfolio and greater scale will further enhance the company's relevance to its customers.
 
Novellus' current structure is very similar to Lam's, with business units around specific product lines and accounts teams focused around specific customers, plus manufacturing, customer service and support corporate functions. There is an intention to comprehensively integrate Lam and Novellus across functions.
 
The combination creates the opportunity to grow revenue at a faster rate by:
Revenue growth synergies:
 
 
 
The company expects to realize cost synergies through this transaction of approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the end of CY2013, excluding tax. We will achieve these synergies by:
Cost-reduction synergies:
 
 
 
 
 
 
This transaction's value creation results in significant upside for Novellus' shareholders. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share, a 28% premium to current. In addition, Novellus' shareholders will share in the upside of the combined entity through the value of synergies realized, and will additionally receive the benefit of earnings-per-share accretion from the authorized $1.6 billion share repurchase program. The transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months post transaction close.
 
 
 
The addition of Novellus makes Lam a stronger partner with customers and enhances revenue growth potential. The combined company will have a broader product portfolio, and a stronger financial profile. Lam shareholders will also receive upside from synergies realized. In addition, Lam shareholders will benefit from the authorized $1.6 billion share repurchase program. The transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months post transaction close. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48 percent cash.
 
Customers should be pleased with this transaction because the strengths of the combined company create an improved ability to address customer needs and deliver on customer requirements. Our customers are facing steep technical challenges today driven by increased process complexity and growing manufacturing costs. The combined company can leverage complementary experience, technologies, and product capabilities to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions that address customers' needs. Further, the combined company is positioned to effectively and efficiently develop 450 mm tools to help customers get to market faster.
 
Novellus shareholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam for every share of Novellus owned. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share. The purchase price reflects a multiple of 16.5 times analyst consensus estimates for 2012 earnings. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48% cash.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to Lam's earnings on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months following deal closure. The transaction can generate significant shareholder value, resulting from the additional market opportunities that the combined company can address and the revenue and cost synergies that can be achieved through the transaction. We are confident in our ability to achieve the synergy opportunities available in this transaction.
 
 
 
We explored multiple options and ultimately pursued an all-stock transaction, which we believe maximizes the benefit to the joint shareholder base. Under the terms of Novellus' existing convertible debt, other deal structures required payments to bondholders that were not in the best interests of the combined company's shareholders. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48% cash.
 
Lam's transaction strategy is structured to meaningfully improve the company's performance through diversification. This transaction represents the most relevant technology / process adjacency expansion for Lam. The SEZ transaction in 2007 has provided us with very relevant experience in integrating companies.
The management and board of directors will be integrated across Lam and Novellus. We expect that the companies' strong cultural fit and proximity will aid the integration plan. Our integration team will be focused on delivering the key value drivers for the transaction. The integration planning will include strong participation from employees of both companies.
 
Given the adjacency of deposition, etch, clean, and surface preparation process steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, it is beneficial to understand how each step integrates with the next. Our ability to leverage the knowledge that we have gleaned through our leadership positions in each of these three critical process segments will enable us to better solve customer challenges as a combined company.
 
We want Lam to continue to be recognized as the most-trusted supplier in the industry. In addition, we would like Lam to be seen as the preeminent global supplier of a broad base of differentiated technology and innovative productivity solutions to the semiconductor industry. Our solutions help customers get to market quickly and offer the lowest total cost of ownership, which is something we're known for.
 
The company shall retain the name "Lam Research" and maintain the ticker symbol (Nasdaq: LRCX).
