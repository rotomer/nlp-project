Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 25, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., January 25, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 25, 2011. Revenue for the period was $584.0 million, gross margin was $234.8 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses were $187.3 million, and net income was $33.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $680.4 million, gross margin of $283.9 million, or 41.7%, operating expenses of $184.5 million, and net income of $71.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the September 2011 quarter. Shipments for the December 2011 quarter were $563 million compared to $580 million during the September 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the December 2011 and September 2011 quarters exclude the amortization of convertible note discounts and certain costs for restructuring and impairments. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the December 2011 quarter exclude certain acquisition related costs. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $41.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the December 2011 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $78.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the September 2011 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the December 2011 quarter was $234.0 million, or 40.1%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of $283.9 million, or 41.7%, for the September 2011 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was due to both lower factory and field utilization as a result of the decline in business volumes and product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the December 2011 quarter decreased to $180.4 million compared with the September 2011 quarter of $182.8 million as a result of reductions in variable compensation associated with the operating income level.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the December 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.4 billion at the end of the December 2011 quarter, compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the September 2011 quarter. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances during the quarter was primarily due to operating activities and the cash settlement of a stock repurchase agreement. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $169.0 million or 29% of revenue during the December 2011 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2011 quarter increased to $191.8 million and $117.3 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $15.5 million as of December 25, 2011.
"Lam delivered solid financial results in the December quarter consistent with expectations, supported by initial leading edge capacity shipments across all segments," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Throughout 2011, we executed on our long-term growth strategy by investing in the technology and productivity solutions that address our customers' most critical needs and position Lam to solidify and grow its position in etch and single-wafer clean. In addition, as announced in December, we plan to extend our product and services portfolio and leadership in wafer fab equipment via the acquisition of Novellus Systems. We believe that the complementary market positions, technologies, product capabilities and leadership of both companies will provide more comprehensive and faster solutions to our customers and provide improved financial performance for our shareholders," Anstice concluded.
