Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 24, 2012
FREMONT, Calif., July 25, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2012 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 24, 2012. The Company completed the merger with Novellus Systems Inc. (Novellus) on June 4, 2012; results reflect twenty days of contributed financial performance resulting from that purchase, prior period comparable results represent Lam Stand-alone performance without exception. Revenue for the period was $741.8 million, gross margin was $298.2 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses were $265.5 million, and net income was $18.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $659.0 million, gross margin of $267.1 million, or 40.5%, operating expenses of $209.0 million, and net income of $45.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the March 2012 quarter. Shipments for the June 2012 quarter were $816 million compared to $713 million during the March 2012 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the June 2012 and March 2012 quarters exclude the amortization of convertible note discounts and certain acquisition and integration-related costs. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the June 2012 quarter exclude costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, and acquisition-related inventory fair value impact. The non-GAAP results for the March 2012 quarter exclude certain costs associated with a customer bankruptcy filing. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
 
 
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2012 Quarter
Comparative highlights between the June 2012 quarter and March 2012 quarter are as follows:
 
Lam Stand-alone non-GAAP gross margin performance improved in the June 2012 quarter as compared to the March 2012 quarter due to favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Lam Stand-alone non-GAAP operating expenses decreased in the June 2012 quarter as compared to the March 2012 quarter due to reductions in employee-related benefit costs.
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2012 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $3.0 billion at the end of the June 2012 quarter, compared to $2.6 billion at the end of the March 2012 quarter. This increase included the impact of $1.1 billion acquired in connection with the Novellus transaction, primarily offset by stock repurchases. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $96.7 million during the June 2012 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2012 quarter increased to $335.4 million and $164.8 million, respectively. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances included $87.1 million and $21.1 million from Novellus related operations, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23.4 million as of June 24, 2012.
"Lam delivered solid financial performance in the June quarter, with sequential growth across our core product and service businesses," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "The quarter also marked the closing of our acquisition of Novellus Systems, and integration is already underway. As we've shared over the past couple of quarters, this combination offers the potential for accelerated growth and we remain focused on aggressively executing our plans to achieve that potential."
