Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On May 23, 2005, Wilfred J. Corrigan's status as an employee of LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company") ceased. Mr. Corrigan remains as the non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. In connection with this event on June 13, 2005, certain stock option agreements (as described below) related to prior stock option grants to Mr. Corrigan were modified as follows:
     Mr. Corrigan's fully vested nonstatutory stock option to purchase 600,000 shares of Company common stock (granted on August 15, 1997) and his fully vested nonstatutory stock option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock (granted on November 20, 1998) were each modified to extend the exercise period for such options through the term of each such option (a period of 10 years from the grant date with respect to each stock option).
     This modification does not result in an accounting charge to the Company.
