Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition
On July 27, 2005, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2005. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three-and six-month periods ended July 3, 2005 and July 4, 2004, and the three-month period ended April 3, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-and six-month periods ended July 3, 2005 and July 4, 2004, and the three-month period ended April 3, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.

LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported second quarter 2005 revenues of $481 million, a 7 percent sequential increase compared to the $450 million reported in the first quarter of 2005, and a 7 percent increase compared to the $448 million reported in the second quarter of 2004.
Milpitas, California 
Second quarter 2005 GAAP* net income improved to $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share compared to first quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Second quarter 2004 GAAP net income was $7 million or 2 cents per diluted share.
Second quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items**, increased to $45 million or 11 cents per diluted share compared to first quarter 2005 net income, excluding special items, of $25 million or 6 cents per diluted share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2004 net income was $28 million or 7 cents per diluted share.
"Increased customer demand for LSI Logic's Storage Components and Storage Systems product offerings provided the momentum for LSI Logic to report a solid second quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI Logic president and chief executive officer. "Storage Components, comprised of Storage ASICs, Storage Standard Products and RAID Storage Adapters, set the pace for the company with a record second quarter. Our Engenio storage systems subsidiary benefited from the successful introduction of its higher-end product line. Growth in Communications reflected stronger than anticipated demand from enterprise networking customers. In Consumer, we were pleased with the revenue strength in DoMiNo-based DVD-recorder and cable set-top box markets, as well as digital audio products, which was balanced by the seasonal decline in game console revenues.
"LSI Logic generated significant sequential and year-over-year revenue growth," said Bryon Look, LSI Logic chief financial officer. "Our gross margins increased over the prior quarter. Profitability improved, both on a GAAP and excluding special items basis. We generated $60 million in cash from operations, reduced convertible debt by $150 million and ended the second quarter of 2005 with $782 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $20 million in the third quarter, and approximately $60 million in total for 2005.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $23 million.

** Acquisition-related amortization, restructuring and other special items.
