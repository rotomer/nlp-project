Exhibit 99.1
      (the "Agreement") is made and entered into this 23rd day of August, 2005 (the "Agreement Date"), between W. Richard Marz ("Employee") and LSI Logic Corporation (the "Company"), with respect to the following recitals of fact:
THIS SEPARATION AGREEMENT
     A. Employee is currently employed as an employee of the Company.
     B. The Company and Employee desire to set forth the terms on which Employee is leaving his employment with the Company.
     in consideration of the promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE,
      Employee acknowledges and agrees that, as of the Agreement Date, Employee has resigned all of his positions with the Company (including, but not limited to, his status as an executive officer of Company), and any positions with other entities that are affiliated with the Company, other than his position as a Technical Consultant, as described in Section 2, below. Employee shall execute a letter of resignation in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A" concurrent with his execution of this Agreement. In addition, Employee shall execute any additional documents that may be necessary or appropriate to effect or to memorialize any resignations from the Company contemplated by this Agreement.
1. .
Resignation
      From and after the Agreement Date, all compensation and benefits shall cease, except for those specifically listed in this Section 2. Employee's position with the Company, including all compensation and eligibility for benefits (other than post-termination benefits specifically described herein), shall terminate on the earlier of: (i) August 31, 2006, or (ii) Employee's commencement of any other employment, occupation, or consulting activity such that this activity would include being an employee of a company and working greater than nineteen (19) hours per week at a single employer (the "Termination Date").
2. .
Change In Status
      Employee will remain an employee of the Company until such time as his employment terminates on the Termination Date. Employee's job title, as of the Agreement Date, will be "Technical Consultant." In this position, Employee will be required to provide technical consulting to the Company on an as-needed basis. Employee's position as Technical Consultant, and any other position with the Company, will terminate as of the Termination Date. During Employee's tenure as a Technical Consultant, Employee shall be paid an annualized salary of $390,000.00, paid every two weeks, less any and all statutory withholding and deductions as required by law or as authorized by Employee.
2.1 .
Position
     . Employee will not be eligible to receive any further stock option grants after the Agreement Date. However, existing stock option grants will continue to vest, until the Termination Date, as described in Section 3, below.
2.2
Stock Options
 
      Employee and Employee's dependents shall continue to be covered by the Company's group benefit plans (e.g., medical, dental, vision care, and life insurance), at the Company's expense, except for the employee-paid portion of such premiums, from the Agreement Date to and including the Termination Date, to the same extent Employee and Employee's dependents were covered by said plans as of the Agreement Date. If Employee desires to continue coverage, pursuant to COBRA, after the Termination Date, Employee may do so at Employee's own expense. Employee understands and agrees that he must complete a COBRA application in order to receive the extension of health benefits beyond the Termination Date.
2.3 .
Benefit Plans
      Employee will not be eligible to participate in any bonus program after the Agreement Date. Employee will not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits after the Agreement Date, other than what is specifically set forth in this Section 2.

      Employee acknowledges that he holds the stock options (the "Options") set forth on Exhibit "B" attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he has no other options or other rights received from the Company to purchase any stock or securities of the Company or any affiliate thereof (collectively, the "Issuers"). Employee's outstanding stock Options will continue to vest through the Termination Date. Any vested Options must be exercised within 90 days of the Termination Date. Employee understands and agrees that all Options which have not vested on or before the Termination Date will expire on the Termination Date, and vested Options not exercised within 90 days of the Termination Date will expire on the 91st day following the Termination Date. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he does not enter into this Agreement on the basis of or in reliance in any way on any representation or assurance of any Issuer or any officer, director, employee or agent of any Issuer regarding the current or future value of his Options or of any stock or securities of any Issuer.

The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the expiration or termination, for any reason, of this Agreement.
      This Agreement is entered into in the State of California and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of any other jurisdiction.

For the purposes of this Agreement all of the foregoing items which I am bound to maintain confidential, or with respect to which I have a duty or obligation shall be referred to in this Agreement, individually and collectively as "Proprietary Information".
Confidentiality
     2. . I agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, during my employment with the Company I will not engage in any other employment, occupation, consulting or other activity relating to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business of the Company or which would otherwise conflict with my obligations to the Company. If my employment with the Company terminates for any reason I agree to promptly surrender and deliver to the Company all records, drawings, documents and data pertaining to any Proprietary Information as well as tangible property related thereto which I then have in my custody or control. Further, I will not take with me any document, disk or other thing containing or pertaining to any Proprietary Information which I may produce or obtain during the course of my employment with the Company.
Conflicting Employment; Return of Confidential Material
 
     3. . I hereby assign and transfer to the Company my entire right, title and interest in all Proprietary Information, conceived solely by me or jointly with Others during the period of my employment with the Company. This Agreement does not require assignment of any invention excluded from any assignment by Section 2870 of the California Labor Code (hereinafter "Section 2870").
Assignment of Inventions
     4. . I agree that in connection with any invention, trade secret, work of authorship, proprietary information or proprietary thing:
Disclosure of Inventions
        (a) I will disclose all Proprietary Information upon conception or creation in writing to my immediate supervisor, with a copy to the Company's Patent Counsel, regardless of whether I believe the invention is protected by Section 2870, in order to permit the Company to claim rights to which it may be entitled under this Agreement. Such disclosure shall be received in confidence by the Company;
        (b) Upon the Company's request, I will promptly execute a written assignment to the Company of all right, title, and interest to any Proprietary Information and I will preserve the aforementioned as confidential information of the Company;

I represent and covenant that the list is complete and that if no items are on the list, I have no such prior inventions. I hereby certify that I have no continuing obligations with respect to assignment of inventions to any previous employer. I understand that any improvements, whether subject to patent, copyright or other protection, made on the listed inventions after the commencement of my employment by the Company are assigned or are to be assigned to the Company to the extent that such improvements are covered by the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Agreement.
Prior Inventions
     7. . I acknowledge that the Company, from time to time, may have agreements with other persons or with the U.S. Government, or agencies thereof, which impose obligations or restrictions on the Company regarding Proprietary Information made in the course of that work or regarding the confidential nature of such work. I agree to be bound by all such obligations and restrictions and to take all action necessary to discharge the obligations of the Company thereunder.
Other Obligations
 
     8. . I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and as an employee of the Company does not and will not breach any Agreement made prior to my employment with the Company to keep in confidence or in trust any confidential or Proprietary Information or material including any invention, trade secret or work of authorship belonging to any previous employer of mine or any other person. I agree not to enter into any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith. I will not disclose to the Company, nor induce the Company to receive or use, any confidential information, trade secret, work of authorship, proprietary information or proprietary thing belonging to, or designated as confidential by any previous employer of mine or by any other person.
Trade Secrets, Property Rights and Confidential Information of Others

Modification
     12. . I acknowledge receipt of this Agreement, and agree that with respect to the subject matter hereof it is my entire agreement with the Company, superseding any previous oral or written understandings or agreements with the Company or any officer or representative thereof.
Entire Agreement
 
     13. . If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified so as to be legal and enforceable in a manner that is as consistent with the original intent as possible, or if such is not be possible it shall be severed from this Agreement shall not fail on account thereof, but shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
