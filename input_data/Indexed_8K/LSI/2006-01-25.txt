LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three- and 12-month periods ended December 312005 and December 31, 2004, and the three-month period ended October 2, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, acquisition-related amortization including intangibles and non-cash deferred stock compensation and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three- and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the three-month period ended October 2, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
