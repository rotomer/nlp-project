Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 26, 2006, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release. LSI Logic management believes that the results of operations excluding special items presented herein for the three-month periods ended April 22006 and April 3, 2005, and the three-month period ended December 31, 2005 provide useful information to investors regarding results of operations, as they exclude charges, expenses, gains, and losses that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. These business results are used by management for evaluating historical performance in addition to being used for the Company's forecasting and planning for future periods. Restructuring of operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and stock-based compensation expense and other special items are examples of charges that are not directly related to the Company's ongoing business results and/or stem from purchase business combinations. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2006 and April 3, 2005, and the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Exceeding guidance, first quarter 2006 GAAP* net income was $19 million or 5 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $5 million or 1 cent per diluted share. First quarter 2006 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $38 million or 9 cents per diluted share.

Cash and short-term investments grew 19% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, from $866 million in the year-ago period and up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2005.
"Continuing strong demand for our silicon-to-systems storage products helped to offset an expected seasonal revenue decline," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth within our storage components and storage systems markets, with Engenio achieving near record quarterly revenues. Going forward, we expect to benefit from increasing demand and technology transitions in our storage markets as well as the growing demand for digital media processing products in our consumer markets."
"During the first quarter, GAAP net income substantially improved over the year-ago period as revenues expanded and we continued to carefully manage operating expenses," said Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer. "Our balance sheet remained strong, with cash and short-term investments topping $1 billion."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $10 million in the second quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2006.
Second quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $14 million.
