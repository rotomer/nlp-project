Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On January 24, 2007, LSI Logic Corporation (referred to here as "LSI Logic" or the "Company") issued a news release regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
LSI Logic has referenced non-GAAP financial information in the news release.
LSI Logic management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP financial measures:
Non-GAAP net income:
Non-GAAP net income is important to the Company for the reasons noted above and excludes the following items:

Non-GAAP net income per basic and dilutive share:
The calculation of non-GAAP net income excluding special items per dilutive share is adjusted in the numerator for all the items discussed above under net income excluding special items. In the denominator, the number of non-GAAP dilutive shares excludes the following item:
Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below in relation to the items excluded from those non-GAAP measures.
Table of Contents
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For a complete reconciliation of special items excluded from our results of operations for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the three-month period ended October 1, 2006, refer to the tables furnished in the news release attached as Exhibit 99.1.
