Item 2.05 Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.
On June 27, 2007, the Company announced a broad restructuring and an acceleration of merger related synergies to further reduce operating expenses. LSI announced that it will eliminate 900 positions or about 13 percent of its non-production workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring is the result of a portfolio review that LSI has been conducting under a three-phase business acceleration plan adopted following its merger with Agere Systems on April 2, 2007. In connection with the restructuring, we recorded a charge of approximately $24 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2007, which represents future cash expenditures for termination related benefits to be paid primarily by the end of the third quarter of 2007.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: July 25, 2007
