Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On November 9, 2007, our Board of Directors amended Article III, Section 3.3 of our bylaws to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In a contested election, directors will be elected by a plurality vote. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who fails to receive the requisite majority vote must tender his or her resignation for consideration to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any such resignation in light of the best interests of the company and its stockholders, and any other factors it deems relevant, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and will disclose its decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer and, if it chooses to reject the offer, its reasons for doing so, within 90 days following certification of the election results.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: November 15, 2007

 
Exhibit 3.1
     The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.
     The board of directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
          (a) Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation. The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 2.1(b).
          (b) If authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law:
               (i) Participate in a meeting of stockholders; and
               (ii) Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
 
communication, provided that (A) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (B) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.
          (c) For purposes of this Section 2.1, "" shall include (1) telephone or other voice communications and (2) electronic mail or other form of written or visual electronic communications satisfying the requirements of Section 2.5.
remote communication
     The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. At the meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.
     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time only by a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board, by the president or by the chief executive officer.
     If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than a majority of the board of directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the time of such meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the corporate secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The secretary, upon receiving the request, shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.5, and that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons who called the meeting, not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request. Nothing contained in this second paragraph of Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of a majority of the board of directors may be held.
     All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these by-laws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and (unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides) any special meeting of stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the board of directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
-2-
 
          (a) Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
          (b) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate of incorporation, or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability actually becomes known to the corporate secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of these by-laws, "" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, which creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
provided, however,
electronic transmission
     The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice or other announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
-3-
 
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by (a) the chairman of the board, or (b) in the absence thereof, such person as the chairman of the board of directors shall appoint, or (c) in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the board shall fail to make such appointment, such person as the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall appoint or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman of the executive committee of the corporation shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors. In the absence of the corporate secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
     The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
     Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of
-4-
 
votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates' names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as he may see fit.
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
          (a) Actions other than Written Consent. For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
-5-
 
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
          (b) Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors may, at any time within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)). If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be
-6-
 
construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
-7-
 
     Such inspector(s) shall:
          (a) Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
          (b) Receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) Count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          (e) Determine when the polls shall close;
          (f) Determine the result; and
          (g) Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
          (a) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at any meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in these by-laws, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
          (b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before a stockholders meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 2.16(a), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the corporate secretary of the corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the corporate secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than ninety (90) calendar days before the anniversary of the date that the corporation's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the prior year's meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10) day following the day notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any successor thereto) and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (or any successor thereto) (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected);
provided, however
th
-8-
 
(ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.16.
     Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
     Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock of the corporation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
     Except as provided in Section 3.4 and in the case of a "Contested Election" (as defined below), each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. For purposes of this Section 3.3, a "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes "for" a director's election must exceed the number of votes "against" that director's election. "Abstentions" and "broker non-votes" will not count as votes cast with respect to that director's election.
-9-
 
     If, as of the last date by which stockholders may submit notice to nominate a person for election as a director pursuant to Article II, Section 2.16, the number of nominees for any election of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be elected.
     Election of directors need not be by written ballot.
     Any director may resign at any time upon written notice or upon electronic transmission to the attention of the corporate secretary of the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws:
          (a) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
          (b) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
     If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board ( as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
-10-
 
     The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
     Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
     Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, a majority of the board of directors, the president or the chief executive officer.
     Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be: (a) delivered personally or orally by telephone or sent by overnight or courier service, facsimile transmission or other form of electronic transmission (such as email), addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting; or (b) sent by first class mail, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation, at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat.
     At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
-11-
 
     A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
     Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need to specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.
     Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that, so long as shareholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors.
     No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.

     The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in the by-laws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend the by-laws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the by-laws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     The board of directors may appoint, or empower the president or chief executive officer to appoint, such other officers and agents as the business of the corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these by-laws or as the board of directors may from time to time determine. Executive officers of the corporation shall only be those officers expressly designated as such by the board of directors.
     Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by an affirmative vote of the majority of the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in the case of an officer chosen by the board of directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the board of directors.
     Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice or by sending an electronic transmission to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or transmission or at any later time specified in that notice or transmission; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice or transmission, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.

     The corporate secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar, as determined by resolution of the board of directors, a share register, or a duplicate share register, showing the names of all stockholders and their addresses, the number and classes of shares held by each, the number and date of certificates evidencing such shares, and the number and date of cancellation of every certificate surrendered for cancellation.

     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in (as a party, witness or otherwise), any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "") (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (collectively ""), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with the respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.

Agent
     The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
-17-
 
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     To the extent that an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
     Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, of if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
-18-
 
     If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending an Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
     If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section. The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Agent who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Agent, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Agent's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Agent's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to
-19-
 
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity in another capacity while holding such office.
     The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

Independent Counsel
     Upon resolution passed by the board of directors, the corporation may establish a trust or other designated account, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit), to ensure the payment of certain of its obligations arising under this Article VI and/or agreements which may be entered into between the corporation and its officers and directors from time to time.
     The provisions of this Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not an Agent (as defined in Section 6.1), but whom the corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or otherwise. The corporation may, in its sole discretion, indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent as permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The corporation shall indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent where required by law.
     If this Article or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then: (a) the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any Proceeding, whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)

     The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract between the corporation and each Agent who serves in such capacity at any time while these by-laws are in effect, and any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any Proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.
     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VI to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 6.5 hereof), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any Agent in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the board of directors of the corporation.
     The corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
     Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may be deem just and proper.

     The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these by-laws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
     The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the corporate secretary or an assistant corporate secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the

     Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
     Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, shall govern the construction of these by-laws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "" includes both a corporation and a natural person.

     The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in (i) the General Corporation Law of Delaware or (ii) the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.
     The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies.
     The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors.

     Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.
     The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
     The by-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws.
