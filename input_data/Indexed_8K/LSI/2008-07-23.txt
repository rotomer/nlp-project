Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 23, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended June 29, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the second quarter of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007 and the Consumer business that we sold in late July 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
 
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:
 
All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its second quarter ended June 29, 2008.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 23, 2008 
 
 
Second quarter 2008 revenues were $692 million, a 3% increase year-over-year compared to $670 million reported in the second quarter of 2007, and up 5% sequentially compared to $661 million reported in the first quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the sale of the consumer and mobility businesses, second quarter revenues increased 24% year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Second quarter 2008 GAAP* net loss was $14 million or 2 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $378 million or 50 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to first quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $97 million from special items, consisting primarily of $58.6 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $20.7 million of restructuring costs and other items, and $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Second quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $83 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2007 non-GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. First quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $64 million or 10 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end.
"Strong worldwide demand for our storage systems and networking products helped us deliver another quarter of solid results," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "During the quarter, we also continued to build significant momentum for the future, introducing several new storage and networking products and securing additional silicon design wins with top-tier hard disk drive and server makers.
"Our business has demonstrated resilience through recent market uncertainty, and we expect this to continue as the positive effects of seasonal buying patterns materialize in the second half," added Talwalkar.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "Our second quarter results reflect the ongoing benefit of the many strategic and operational steps we have taken over the past four quarters. Increases in net income compared to the year-ago period were significant, and we continue to focus on improving our top and bottom line results."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2008.
Third quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.
