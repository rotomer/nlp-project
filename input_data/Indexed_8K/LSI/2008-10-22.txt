Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 22, 2008, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended September 28, 2008. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
The news release also presents information about our revenues for the third quarter of 2007, excluding revenues from the Mobility business that we sold in late October 2007 and the Consumer business that we sold in late July 2007. We believe that the presentation of revenues computed on this basis may be useful to investors as it enables them to compare the revenue performance of the businesses that we currently operate.
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc08-67
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its third quarter ended September 28, 2008.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 22, 2008 
 
 
Third quarter 2008 revenues were $714 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year compared to $727 million reported in the third quarter of 2007, and up 3% sequentially compared to $692 million reported in the second quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the sale of the consumer and mobility businesses, third quarter revenues increased 14% year-over-year compared to the third quarter of 2007.
Third quarter 2008 GAAP* net income was $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 GAAP net loss of $141 million or 20 cents per share. Third quarter 2008 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. Third quarter 2008 GAAP net income included a net charge of $83 million from special items, consisting primarily of $60.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $16.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.7 million in write-down of investments, and $1.6 million in net restructuring and other items.
Third quarter 2008 non-GAAP** net income was $94 million or 14 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $44 million or 6 cents per share. Second quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $83 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.2 billion at quarter end.
"Healthy demand in the quarter for our HDD and SAN semiconductors provided a foundation for delivering solid results," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We are also pleased by our progress in securing new opportunities, with recently announced Tier 1 OEM wins for next-generation HDD, SSD and 6Gb/s SAS products.
"Although fourth quarter visibility is limited, we are confident that our strategic focus, continuing design win momentum and strong financial position leave us well positioned for the foreseeable future," added Talwalkar.
Bryon Look, LSI chief financial officer, said, "Significantly higher gross margins and continued focus on cost control contributed to third quarter EPS near the high end of our guidance range. Compared to the same quarter in 2007 we have grown revenue in our core businesses by 14% while significantly reducing quarterly operating expenses."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $10 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $60 million in total for 2008.
Fourth quarter depreciation and software amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.
