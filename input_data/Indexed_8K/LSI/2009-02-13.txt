You and LSI agree that the precise amount of damages LSI will experience if you violate your agreement in the first sentence of this paragraph 9 would be impracticable or extremely difficult to calculate or prove, and that $125,000 (the Liquidated Damages) constitutes a best estimate of those damages for each employee solicited or induced.

The value of any options that LSI so cancels may not exceed the Liquidated Damages amount multiplied by the number of employees solicited or induced. LSI will calculate that value on the cancellation date using the valuation methodology it then uses for financial reporting purposes.

10. .
Suspension of Exercisability

LSI shall make reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state, federal or foreign law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.

If the option is scheduled to expire during one of those periods, you will need to exercise the option before that period begins.

Grant
 
 
2. . Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest, you will have no right to payment of them. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, those Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation of LSI.
LSIs Obligation to Pay
 
 
3. . The Restricted Stock Units are scheduled to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on any date actually will vest only if you have not incurred a Termination of Service prior to that date and any performance goals required to be met have been met. Unless the Board determines otherwise, vesting will continue during any LSI-approved leave of absence.
Vesting Schedule
 
 
4. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to you in whole shares, subject to you satisfying any applicable tax withholding obligations. Subject to paragraph 8(b), any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid in shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case no later than the 15 day of the third month following the vesting date.

Death
 
 
7. .
Withholding of Taxes
 
 
(a)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, you will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if you are a U.S. taxpayer. If you are a non-U.S. taxpayer, you will be subject to applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.
 
 
(b)  Whenever Restricted Stock Units vest, LSI will withhold a portion of the shares otherwise issuable that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay Tax Obligations determined by LSI to be applicable in connection with such vesting. If LSI determines Tax Obligations are applicable in connection with your Restricted Stock Units at any other time, LSI may, in its sole discretion, collect from you an amount equal to such Tax Obligations in any of the following ways: (i) by withholding a portion of the proceeds from your sale of the shares issued to you upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, (ii) by withholding, or having the Affiliate that employs you withhold, such amount from salary or other amounts payable to you, or (iii) requiring you to pay such amount to LSI.  LSI may require or otherwise allow you to make alternate arrangements to satisfy such Tax Obligations.
 
 
(c)  LSI will not withhold or issue any fractional shares.  LSI will not deliver shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to LSI have been made for the satisfaction of Tax Obligations.
 
 
(d)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, LSI (or the employing Affiliate) has the right to retain without notice from salary or other amounts payable to you, amounts sufficient to satisfy any Tax Obligations that LSI determines cannot be satisfied through the withholding of shares.  All Tax Obligations related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares delivered upon vesting are your sole responsibility. By [signing the Notice of Grant] [accepting this Award], you expressly consent to the withholding of shares and to any additional cash withholding under this paragraph 7.
 
 
8. .
Committee Discretion
 
 
(a)  The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of some or all of the Restricted Stock Units at any time. If so accelerated, those Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee.  Subject to this paragraph 8, if the Committee accelerates the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units, the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will be made no later than the 15 day of the third month following the accelerated vesting date. However, if the Restricted Stock Units are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then, to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, the payment of the accelerated portion of those Restricted Stock Units will be made at the same time or times as if such Restricted Stock Units had vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in paragraph 3 (whether or not you remain employed by LSI or an Affiliate as of such date(s)), including any necessary delay under paragraph 8(b).
th
 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of any Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with your Termination of Service (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by LSI), other than due to death and if (x) you are a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such Termination of Service and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to you on or within the six (6) month period following your Termination of Service, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until at least six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of your Termination of Service, unless you die following your Termination of Service, in which case the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in shares to your estate or beneficiary as soon as practicable following your death.  It is the intent of this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units or shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply.  
,
 
 
9. . You will not have any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any shares deliverable hereunder until those shares have been delivered to you or deposited in your account at LSIs designated broker.
