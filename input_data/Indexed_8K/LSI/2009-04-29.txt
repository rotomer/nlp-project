Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 29, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 5, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended April 5, 2009.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 29, 2009 
 
 
First quarter 2009 revenues were $482 million, a 27% decrease year-over-year compared to $661 million reported in the first quarter of 2008, and down 21% sequentially compared to $610 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2008.
First quarter 2009 GAAP* net loss was $104 million or 16 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. First quarter 2009 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $606 million or 94 cents per share. First quarter 2009 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $86 million from special items, consisting primarily of $42.7 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $25.2 million in net restructuring and other items and $18 million of stock-based compensation expense.
First quarter 2009 non-GAAP** net loss was $18 million or 3 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income of $64 million or 10 cents per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income was $41 million or 6 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion at quarter end.
"Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, our first quarter revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range with our storage semiconductor and networking businesses demonstrating strength late in the quarter," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "We have also significantly lowered our operating expenses while continuing to invest in key opportunities which position us to grow at above-market rates coming out of the downturn."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "Through a combination of effective cost controls and streamlining actions, operating expenses for the quarter came in below our expected range. Inventory levels were also sequentially down and sharply lower on a year-over-year basis, contributing to our continued balance sheet strength."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $50 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $20 million in the second quarter and approximately $90 million in total for 2009.
