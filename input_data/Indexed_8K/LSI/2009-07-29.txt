Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On July 29, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended July 5, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its second quarter ended July 5, 2009.
MILPITAS, Calif., July 29, 2009 
 
 
Second quarter 2009 revenues were $521 million, an 8% increase sequentially compared to $482 million reported in the first quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 revenues decreased 25% year-over-year compared to $692 million reported in the second quarter of 2008.
Second quarter 2009 GAAP* net loss was $61 million or 9 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $104 million or 16 cents per share. Second quarter 2009 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2008 GAAP net loss of $14 million or 2 cents per share. Second quarter 2009 GAAP net loss included a net charge of $69 million from special items, consisting primarily of $43 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $17 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $8.6 million in net restructuring and other items.
Second quarter 2009 non-GAAP** net income was $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share compared to first quarter 2009 non-GAAP net loss of $18 million or 3 cents per share. Second quarter non-GAAP net income compares to second quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income of $83 million or 13 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $874 million at quarter end. LSI redeemed $243 million of convertible notes in the second quarter and increased net cash, or cash and short-term investments minus debt, by $44 million.
"Although the economic environment remains uncertain, our second quarter revenues came in significantly above the midpoint of our guidance range with growth in both our storage and networking businesses," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "LSI is now beginning to realize tangible results from our work over the past several years to transform the company. Our core businesses are significantly stronger than before, and we are now well positioned to drive long-term growth."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "By maintaining tight controls on spending, our operating expenses decreased sequentially, delivering improvements in our operating results. We also continued to effectively manage our balance sheet, redeeming short-term convertible debt during the quarter while increasing our net cash position."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the third quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $23 million in the third quarter and approximately $90 million in total for 2009.
