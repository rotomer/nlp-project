On October 28, 2009, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended October 4, 2009. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

Exhibit 99.1
cc09-81
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its third quarter ended October 4, 2009.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 28, 2009 
 
 
Third quarter 2009 revenues were $578 million, an 11% increase sequentially compared to $521 million reported in the second quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2009 revenues decreased 19% year over year compared to $714 million reported in the third quarter of 2008.
Third quarter 2009 GAAP* net income was $52 million or 8 cents per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $61 million or 9 cents per share. Third quarter GAAP results included a $65 million tax benefit, or 10 cents per diluted share, primarily related to the settlement of a multi-year foreign tax audit. Third quarter 2009 GAAP results compare to third quarter 2008 GAAP net income of $11 million or 2 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 GAAP net income included a net charge of $66 million from special items, consisting primarily of $43 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $15 million of stock-based compensation expense, $6.6 million in net restructuring and other items, and $1.7 million in write-down of investments.
Third quarter 2009 non-GAAP** net income was $119 million or 18 cents per diluted share compared to second quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Third quarter non-GAAP results included earnings of 10 cents per diluted share reflecting the above-mentioned tax benefit. Third quarter non-GAAP net income compares to third quarter 2008 non-GAAP net income of $94 million or 14 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $907 million at quarter end.
"With the economy demonstrating signs that a modest recovery is underway, our third quarter revenues exceeded our guidance range, supported by healthy sequential growth across our businesses overall," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "As businesses resume spending on information technology, we are now poised to realize the benefits of the winning recipe we have worked to put in place over the last several years."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "We delivered a very solid third quarter, with improved profitability stemming from strong top-line growth, expanding gross margins across both our semiconductor and storage systems businesses, and continued focus on effectively managing our operating expenses. Operating cash flows were healthy at $69 million and our net cash position increased to $557 million."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $45 million in total for 2009.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $22 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $90 million in total for 2009.
