Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On April 28, 2010, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended April 4, 2010. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc10-39
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its first quarter ended April 4, 2010.
MILPITAS, Calif., April 28, 2010 
 
 
First quarter 2010 revenues were $637 million, a 32% increase year-over-year compared to $482 million reported in the first quarter of 2009, and essentially flat sequentially compared to $638 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009.
First quarter 2010 GAAP* net income was $23 million or 3 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 GAAP net loss of $104 million or 16 cents per share. First quarter GAAP results included a net tax benefit of $19 million primarily related to the expiration of statutes of limitations. First quarter 2010 GAAP results compare to fourth quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $65 million or 10 cents per diluted share. First quarter 2010 GAAP net income included a net charge of $70 million from special items, consisting primarily of $40 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense, $12 million of loss on write-down of equity securities, and $2 million of net restructuring and other items.
First quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income was $92 million or 14 cents per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 non-GAAP net loss of $18 million or 3 cents per share. First quarter non-GAAP results also included the aforementioned net tax benefit of $19 million. Fourth quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income was $124 million or 18 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.0 billion at quarter end. LSI also announced today that it has completed the purchase of approximately 4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $26 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.
"Our strong first quarter results reflect an improving end demand environment as well as increasing operating leverage from the steps we have taken to transform our business over the past few years," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "Revenues were at the high end of our updated guidance range and well above typical seasonal patterns, further underscoring our confidence in our ability to grow faster than the markets we serve."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "First quarter revenues improved significantly on a year-over-year basis and were sequentially flat to the fourth quarter of 2009, offsetting the effects of normal seasonality. We delivered strong earnings performance relative to our upwardly revised guidance and generated solid operating cash flows of $106 million. Semiconductor revenues grew 9% sequentially, while our storage systems business achieved record first-quarter revenues."
 
Capital spending is projected to be around $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $55 million in total for 2010.
Depreciation and software amortization is projected to be around $26 million in the second quarter and approximately $100 million in total for 2010.
