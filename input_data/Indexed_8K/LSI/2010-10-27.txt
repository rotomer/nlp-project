Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
On October 27, 2010, LSI Corporation issued a news release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended October 3, 2010. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The news release contains non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes, and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports.
Management has historically used these non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that these non-GAAP measures continue to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and their valuation of the company.
Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
How we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures
Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP taxes and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share are important to the company for the reasons noted above and exclude the following items:
Table of Contents
We use non-GAAP net income computed as described above as the numerator in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share. We calculate the basic and diluted share amounts used in the denominator in accordance with GAAP rules, using non-GAAP net income rather than GAAP net income.
Limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures
Some of the limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include:

All supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the comparable information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.1
cc10-70
LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported results for its third quarter ended October 3, 2010.
MILPITAS, Calif., October 27, 2010 
 
 
Third quarter 2010 revenues were $629 million, a 9% increase year-over-year compared to $578 million reported in the third quarter of 2009, and compares to $639 million reported in the second quarter of 2010.
Third quarter 2010 GAAP* net income was $23 million or 4 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $52 million or 8 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 GAAP results included a tax benefit of $65 million, or 10 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2010 GAAP results compare to second quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $7 million or 1 cent per diluted share. Third quarter 2010 GAAP net income included a net charge of $56 million from special items, consisting primarily of $40 million of amortization of acquisition-related items, $17 million of stock-based compensation expense, $4 million of net restructuring and other items, and $5 million of gain on the sale of securities.
Third quarter 2010 non-GAAP** net income was $79 million or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 non-GAAP net income of $119 million or 18 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2009 non-GAAP results included earnings of 10 cents per diluted share reflecting the above-mentioned tax benefit. Second quarter 2010 non-GAAP net income was $71 million or 11 cents per diluted share.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $601 million at quarter end. The company completed third-quarter purchases of approximately 32 million shares of its common stock for approximately $137 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has purchased approximately 46 million shares of its common stock for approximately $218 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.
"Healthy growth in our storage systems business coupled with strong execution contributed to solid operating performance, with net income near the high end of our guidance range, despite some end-market softness and related customer inventory adjustments that affected sequential revenues," said Abhi Talwalkar, LSI president and chief executive officer. "While end-market demand challenges could continue, we expect to benefit from new product ramps in 2011 as several of our design wins with top-tier storage and networking customers transition to production."
Bryon Look, LSI CFO and chief administrative officer, said, "Our third quarter results reflect a continuing, strong focus on achieving our business model targets. Gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range, showing solid quarterly expansion and much improvement versus year-ago levels, while operating margins continued to grow on a sequential basis and were sharply higher year over year. Operating cash flows grew 21% sequentially to $82 million and were $256 million on a year-to-date basis, approximately double the $128 million recorded in the same period last year."
