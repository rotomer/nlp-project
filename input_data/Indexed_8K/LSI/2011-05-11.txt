1. Basis of Presentation
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the respective periods presented are based on the historical audited financial statements of LSI Corporation (the "Company") contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 after giving effect to the sale of its external storage systems business (the "Transaction"), which was completed on May 6, 2011, and using the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 is presented as if the Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented as if the Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2008 and do not assume interest income on the cash proceeds.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are based upon available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances and are prepared to illustrate the estimated effects of the Transaction. You should read this information in conjunction with the Company's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2010 and for the years ended December 2010, 2009 and 2008, included in the LSI annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been provided for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been achieved had the Transaction occurred as of or for the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of the Company's future operating results or financial position.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the anticipated effects of additional restructuring charges related to severance and certain contractual obligations because estimates of these potential costs cannot be quantified at this time.
     
2. Pro Forma Adjustments
     The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet:
