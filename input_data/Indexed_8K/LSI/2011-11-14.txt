MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
 
(a)
 
Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at the address of such stockholder as it appears on the records of the corporation.
 
(b)
 
Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be effective if delivered by electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, which consent may be express or, if permitted under and in accordance with applicable law, implied.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability actually becomes known to the corporate secretary or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.  Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed given:  (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
provided, however,
 
(c)
 
Any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
 
(d)
 
Whenever notice is required to be given, under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a
 
 
 
-3-
 
 
certificate under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
 
(e)  An affidavit of the corporate secretary, an assistant corporate secretary, the transfer agent of the corporation or other agent that notice of any meeting of stockholders has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
2.6
 
QUORUM
 
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation.  If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice or other announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.  The stockholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
2.7
 
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these by-laws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any (and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person at such adjourned meeting), thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  The chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason, and the stockholders shall have the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6 of these by-laws.

-4-
 
 
any officer of the corporation elected by the board of directors.  In the absence of the corporate secretary, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.
 
The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting).
 
2.9
 
VOTING
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these by-laws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
 
Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, or as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
 
At a stockholders meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these by-laws) prior to commencement of the voting and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholders intention to cumulate votes.  If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) such holder of stock would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such holders shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by such holder, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as the holder may see fit.
 
2.10
 
WAIVER OF NOTICE
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
 
 
 
-5-
 
 
meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.
 
2.11
 
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.  If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
 
(a)
 
Actions other than Written Consent.  For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or other lawful purpose (other than the expression of consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting) the directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
 
 
-6-
 
 
 
(b)
 
Action by Written Consent.  In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the corporate secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date.  The board of directors may, at any time within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b)), which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.12(b) or otherwise within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the corporate secretary.  Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 2.12(b), to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation may engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, in the event such inspectors are appointed, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as such appointed independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance herewith represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.12(b) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after any certification by any independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this
 
 
 
-7-
 
 
Section 2.12(b), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed herein.
 
2.13
 
PROXIES
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the corporate secretary, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, electronic representation or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
2.14
 
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
 
The corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) during ordinary business hours, at the corporations principal place of business; or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 
2.15
 
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one or three.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Such inspector(s) shall perform such duties as may be required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Any indemnification under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.  To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.  Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as follows:  (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined); or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the
 
 
 
-23-
 
 
board of directors.  If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
 
6.5
 
RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT
 
If a claim under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including attorneys fees) of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.  The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6.4 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this section.  The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant this section that the procedures and presumptions of Section 6.4 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the corporation is bound by all such procedures and presumptions.
 
 
6.6
 
PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE
 
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an Indemnitee who is a party to a Proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation then in office, which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such Indemnitee, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such Indemnitee's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
 
 
 
-24-
 
 
 
6.7
 
INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted pursuant to this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate of incorporation, any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
6.8
 
INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION
 
The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Indemnitee against any liability asserted against, or incurred by, such person by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or that such director or officer is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

.  If a Participants severance and other benefits hereunder or otherwise payable to a Participant (the ) would constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and, but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the ), then a Participants Payment shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The  shall be the greater of (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax; or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment; whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the Participants receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of the Payment.
Limitation on Payments
Payment
Excise Tax
Reduced Amount
If a reduction in the Payment is necessary pursuant to the preceding paragraph, reduction shall occur in the following order: (1) reduction of cash payments, which shall occur in reverse chronological order such that the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering such excise tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced; (2) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards, which shall occur in the reverse order of the date of grant for such stock awards (i.e., the vesting of the most recently granted stock awards will be reduced first); and (3) reduction of employee benefits, which shall occur in reverse chronological order such that the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering such excise tax will be the first benefit to be reduced.  If two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.  In no event shall a Participant have any discretion with respect to the ordering of payment reductions.
Any determination required under this section entitled Limitation on Payments will be made in writing by a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Company (the ), whose determination will be conclusive and binding upon a Participant and the Company for all purposes.  For purposes of making the calculations required by this section, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.
Firm
  Any cash payments (other than COBRA reimbursements) to which a Participant becomes entitled hereunder shall be made immediately following the effectiveness and irrevocability of the Release, and in no case later than March 15th of the year following the year after which a Participants Qualifying Separation occurred such that any such payment shall come within the short term deferral rule of Section 409A.
Timing of Cash Payments.
Each payment or benefit under this Policy is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that this Policy and the payment of all benefits hereunder be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A under the  exemption, or to otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A, so that none of the payments and benefits to be provided will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be exempt or so comply. 
Section 409A.  
short-term deferral
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if severance payments or benefits payable hereunder are 
deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then such severance will be paid on the 60 day following a Participants Qualifying Separation, or, if later, such time as required by the next paragraph, and except as required by the next paragraph, any payment or benefit accrued during such 60 day
th

period will be paid on the 60th day following a Participants Qualifying Separation.
 
In addition, if severance payments or benefits payable hereunder are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and if a Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of a Participant's separation from service, then if and to the extent necessary to avoid additional taxation under Section 409A, any deferred compensation severance payments or benefits payable to a Participant under this Policy or otherwise will not be made until the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is six months and one day following the date of a Participant's separation from service and (ii) the date of a Participant's death, and all subsequent deferred compensation severance will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Participant, to take such actions and make any amendments to this Policy as it deems necessary, advisable or desirable to comply with Section 409A or to otherwise avoid income recognition under Section 409A or imposition of any additional tax prior to the actual payment of any amounts or benefits to a particular Participant.
