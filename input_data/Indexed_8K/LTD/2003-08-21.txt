Exhibit 99.1 LIMITED BRANDS REPORTS 2003 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS Columbus, Ohio, August 21, 2003 -- Limited Brands (NYSE: LTD) today reported 2003 second quarter results. Earnings per share were $0.19 for the second quarter compared to $0.16 last year. Operating income was $170.4 million compared to $138.7 million last year, and net income was $102.0 million compared to $83.2 million last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter ended August 2, 2003 increased 3% and net sales of $2.014 billion increased 5% compared to sales of $1.912 billion last year. The Company also stated that August sales have been below plan at the apparel group, and that overall comparable store sales are currently somewhat below its expectation for a low single digit positive comp. However, the Company stated that it is comfortable with the current First Call earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters of $0.04 and $0.74 per share, respectively, as it plans to make up for the August shortfall in September and October, based on activities in those months.

LIMITED BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED RESULTS The "Adjusted Results" provided in the attached unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income are non-GAAP financial measures and reflect the following: Fiscal 2003 For the first quarter of 2003, adjusted results exclude a $79.7 million pretax, non-operating gain resulting from the sale of approximately one-half of the Company's investment in Alliance Data Systems Corporation. Fiscal 2002 In the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed a tender offer and merger that resulted in the acquisition of the Intimate Brands, Inc. ("IBI") minority interest. The adjusted results: .. Eliminate the minority interest and increase total weighted average shares outstanding to reflect the recombination as if it had occurred at the beginning of 2002. .. Eliminate a $33.8 million pretax, special non-cash charge relating to the exchange of vested IBI stock options and restricted stock for similar Limited Brands stock awards. The adjusted results also exclude the results of Lerner New York ("Lerner") which are classified as a discontinued operation in the reported results. Adjusted results also reflect additional interest income from the $75 million subordinated note received in connection with the sale of Lerner, which bears interest at 10% per annum. The Unaudited Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Income should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company's definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company. The Unaudited Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Income should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.
