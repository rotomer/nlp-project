Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The employment agreement between Limited Brands, Inc. (the "Company") and V. Ann Hailey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer has been amended as of March 8, 2005 (the "Amendment") in connection with recently announced organizational changes. Capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Amendment. Under the Amendment, Ms. Hailey may terminate employment by providing to the Company, at any time from September 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006, notice of intent to terminate employment, which shall be considered a termination of employment for Good Reason. A termination of employment for Good Reason entitles Ms. Hailey to certain specified compensation and other benefits under her current employment agreement.
If before March 1, 2006, either the Company or Ms. Hailey determines that she should no longer continue employment in her then current position (other than pursuant to a notice of termination of employment for Good Reason), the Company shall continue to employ Ms. Hailey in a senior executive position at her current level of compensation and benefits through March 1, 2008. If the Company terminates Ms. Hailey's employment other than for Cause or due to a Disability before March 1, 2006, the Company shall provide her, at her option, with either (i) certain specified compensation and other benefits consistent with her current employment agreement or (ii) the compensation and benefits to which she would have been entitled had her employment continued through March 1, 2008 at her current level of compensation and benefits. In the event that neither Ms. Hailey nor the Company takes any of these actions within the specified dates, then in effect her current employment agreement continues to govern her employment relationship with the Company.
The Amendment also sets forth certain compensation to be provided to Ms. Hailey if her employment is terminated (i) by the Company for Cause, (ii) by the Company other than for Cause or by Ms. Hailey for Good Reason, (iii) by reason of Disability, (iv) by reason of the Company's decision not to extend the Employment Agreement or (v) pursuant to a Change in Control.
The Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT entered into as of January 2, 2004 between V. Ann Hailey (the Executive) and Limited Brands, Inc. and The Limited Service Corporation (the Company) is hereby amended as of March 8, 2005 in the following respects:
1.      Section 2(a) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
        (a)      . The Executive shall be employed as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer or such other position of reasonably comparable or greater status and responsibilities, as may be determined by the Board of Directors. The Executive shall perform the duties, undertake the responsibilities, and exercise the authority customarily performed, undertaken, and exercised by persons employed in a similar executive capacity. The Executive shall report to the Chief Administrative Officer and shall report "dotted line" to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Position
2.    Section 9(c) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
        (c)      . The Executive may terminate employment hereunder for Good Reason by delivering to the Company (1) a Preliminary Notice of Good Reason (as defined below), and (2) not earlier than thirty (30) days from the delivery of such Preliminary Notice, a Notice of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason means (i) the failure to continue the Executive in a capacity contemplated by Section 2 hereof (or, if applicable, Section 10(h)(i) hereof); (ii) the assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent with the Executives positions, duties, authority, responsibilities, and reporting requirements as set forth in Section 2 hereof (or, if applicable, Section 10(h)(i) hereof); (iii) a reduction in or a material delay in payment of the Executives total cash compensation and benefits from those required to be provided in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (iv) the Company, the Board or any person controlling the Company requires the Executive to be based outside of the United States, other than on travel reasonably required to carry out the Executives obligations under the Agreement; or (v) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption in writing of its obligation to perform this Agreement by any successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Company within 15 days after a merger, consolidation, sale, or similar transaction; provided, however, that Good Reason shall not include (A) acts not taken in bad faith which are cured by the Company in all respects not later than thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the Company of a written notice from the Executive identifying in reasonable detail the act or acts constituting Good Reason (a Preliminary Notice of Good Reason) or (B) acts taken by the Company by reason of the Executives physical or mental infirmity which impairs the Executives ability to substantially perform her duties under this Agreement. A Preliminary Notice of Good Reason shall not, by itself, constitute a Notice of Termination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Executive may terminate employment for "Good Reason" hereunder by providing the Company, at any time from September 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006, notice of intent to terminate employment hereunder for any reason as of the date sixty (60) days following the date of such notice (or as of such earlier date as may be mutually agreed by the Executive and the Company), which such date shall be
Termination by the Executive
treated as the "Termination Date" hereunder, and the Company agrees that any such termination of employment shall be treated for all purposes hereunder as a termination of employment for "Good Reason."
3.      Section 9(d) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
        (d)     . Any purported termination for Cause by the Company or for Good Reason by the Executive (other than a termination pursuant to the last sentence of Section 9(c) hereof) shall be communicated by a written Notice of Termination to the other two weeks prior to the Termination Date (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of Termination shall mean a notice which indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executives employment under the provision so indicated. Any termination by the Company other than for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason shall be communicated by a written Notice of Termination to the other party two (2) weeks prior to the Termination Date. However, the Company may elect to pay the Executive in lieu of two (2) weeks written notice. For purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination of employment shall be effective without such Notice of Termination.
Notice of Termination
4.      Section 10 is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
        10.      .
Compensation Upon Certain Terminations by the Company not Following a Change in Control
                  (a)      If during the term of the Agreement (including any extensions thereof), whether or not following a Change in Control (as defined below), the Executives employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by reason of the Executives death, or if the Executive gives written notice not to extend the term of this Agreement, the Companys sole obligations hereunder shall be to pay the Executive the following amounts earned hereunder but not paid as of the Termination Date: (i) Base Salary, (ii) reimbursement for any and all monies advanced or expenses incurred pursuant to Section 7(b) through the Termination Date, and (iii) any earned compensation which the Executive had previously deferred (including any interest earned or credited thereon) (collectively, Accrued Compensation), provided however, that if the Executive gives written notice not to extend the Employment Term pursuant to Section 1, the Company shall continue to pay the premiums provided for in Section 7(a)(1) through the end of the calendar year in which the Executives termination occurs. The Executives entitlement to any other benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Companys employee benefit plans then in effect.
                  (b)      Except as otherwise provided in Section 10(h) hereof, if the Executives employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, in each case other than during the 24-month period immediately following a Change in Control, the Companys sole obligations hereunder shall be as follows:
                                    (i)  the Company shall pay the Executive the Accrued Compensation;

                                    (iv)   the Company shall continue to pay the premiums provided for in Section 7(a)(1) hereof through the end of the calendar year in which such termination occurs;
                                    (v)   provided, however, that in the event Executive becomes entitled to any payments under Section 10(g), the Companys obligations to Executive under Section 10 shall thereafter be determined solely under Section 10 (g).
                  (c) If the Executives employment is terminated by the Company by reason of the Executives Disability, the Companys sole obligations hereunder shall be as follows:
                                    (i)   the Company shall pay the Executive the accrued Compensation;

                                    (iii)  if the Executive is disabled beyond thirty-six (36) months, the Company shall continue to pay the Executive 60% of Base Salary, up to a maximum payment of $250,000 per year, for the period of the Executives Disability, as defined in the Companys relevant disability plans; provided, however, that such payments shall be reduced by the amount of any benefits the Executive receives by reason of her Disability under the Companys relevant disability plan or plans; and
                                     (iv)   the Company shall continue to pay the premiums provided for in Section 7(a)(1) hereof through the end of the calendar year in which such termination occurs.

                                    (iv)  the Company shall continue to pay the premiums provided for in Section 7(a)(1) hereof through the end of the calendar year in which such termination occurs.
                  (e)   For up to eighteen (18) months during the period the Executive is receiving salary continuation pursuant to Section 10(b)(ii), 10(c)(ii) or 10(d)(ii) hereof, the Company shall, at its expense, provide to the Executive and the Executives beneficiaries medical and dental benefits substantially similar in the aggregate to the those provided to the Executive immediately prior to the date of the Executives termination of employment; provided, however, that the Companys obligation to provide such benefits shall cease upon the earlier of Executives becoming employed and the expiration of Executives rights to continue such medical and dental benefits under COBRA.
                  (f)   Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 10 by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such payment or benefit shall be eliminated, offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation provided to the Executive in any subsequent employment, except as provided in Section 10(e).
                  (g)   In the event that (x) the Company enters into a binding agreement that, if consummated, would constitute a Change in Control, (y) Executives employment is terminated under the circumstances set forth in Section 10(b) and (z) within six months after the execution of such agreement a Change in Control of the Company occurs involving one or more of the other parties to such agreement, then the Companys sole obligations hereunder shall be as follows:

                                    (ii)   if on or after March 1, 2006 but before March 1, 2008 and after notice is provided by the Company or Executive in accordance with Section 10(h)(i) hereof, the Executive terminates her employment hereunder for Good Reason or the Company terminates the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason other than Cause (in either case, other than during the 24-month period immediately following a Change in Control), the Company shall provide the Executive, in lieu of the compensation and benefits otherwise payable pursuant to Section 10(b) hereof, with the compensation and benefits to which she would have been entitled had her employment continued through March 1, 2008 in accordance with Section 10(h)(i) hereof; and
