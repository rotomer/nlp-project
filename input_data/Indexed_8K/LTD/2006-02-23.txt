Exhibit 99.1
Columbus, Ohio, February 22, 2006  Limited Brands (NYSE: LTD) today reported 2005 fourth quarter and full year results.
Fourth Quarter Results
Fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.28 compared to $0.87 last year. Fourth quarter operating income was $693.6 million compared to $627.3 million last year, and net income was $519.2 million compared to $382.5 million last year.
The above results contain a number of significant items totaling $0.23 per share in 2005. These items include:
 
 
 
Excluding these items, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.05 compared to $0.87 last year; operating income was $706.4 million compared to $627.3 million last year; and net income was $425.9 million compared to $382.5 million last year. Last year's results include a one-time charge of $0.09 per share ($61 million pretax) related to the Company's accounting for leases and related assets.
Leslie H. Wexner, CEO and Chairman, commented "We're pleased that we were able to exceed our initial fourth quarter earnings guidance of $1.00 per share by five cents. Victoria's Secret, our largest brand, had a solid performance, driven by Pink and the Direct business. The apparel segment improved profitability, driven primarily by an improved performance at Express. Holiday results at Bath & Body Works did not meet our expectations."
Comparable store sales for the quarter ended January 28, 2006 increased 3% and net sales increased 6% to $3.542 billion compared to sales of $3.328 billion last year. 2005 net sales are $30.4 million higher than previously reported sales of $3.511 billion due to the recognition of gift card breakage.
2005 Full Year Results
Earnings per share were $1.66 for the year ended January 28, 2006 compared to $1.47 last year. 2005 operating income was $985.8 million compared to $1.027 billion last year, and net income was $683.3 million compared to $705.4 million last year.
The above results contain a number of significant items totaling $0.32 per share in 2005 and $0.14 per share in 2004. These items include:

Excluding all of these items, 2005 earnings per share were $1.34 compared to $1.33 last year; operating income was $961.2 million compared to $1.027 billion last year; and net income was $549.8 million compared to $637.3 million last year. Last year's results include a one-time charge of $0.08 per share ($61 million pretax) related to the Company's accounting for leases and related assets.
Comparable store sales for the year ended January 28, 2006 decreased 1% and net sales of $9.699 billion increased 3% compared to sales of $9.408 billion last year. 2005 net sales are $30.4 million higher than previously reported sales of $9.669 billion due to the recognition of gift card breakage.
2005 Significant Items
As outlined above, fourth quarter and full year results include a number of significant items. Further information is provided below.
Change in Inventory Valuation Method
In connection with the Company's conversion to new merchandise systems this year, the Company reviewed its inventory valuation methodology. As a result of the review, the Company elected to change its inventory valuation method from the retail method to the weighted average cost method. This change was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Under the retail method, the Company recorded a charge to cost of goods sold based upon actual and estimated permanent reductions in retail selling prices for the season. Under the cost method, the Company does not recognize any impact of reductions in retail selling price until the merchandise is actually sold to the customer or until the Company expects to sell the merchandise below original cost.
The Company believes that the cost method will improve the organizational focus on the actual margin realized on each merchandise sale. Additionally, the cost method is used by many other retailers, as well as the Company's personal care and beauty competitors.
The Company's adoption of the cost method has a number of impacts on the Company's financial statements:
 
 
 
Preliminary unaudited restated quarterly results for 2005, as well as pro forma results reflecting the change in accounting principle for 2004, have been included with this release.
Resolution of Income Tax Matters
The Company's results for the fourth quarter of 2005 include the impact of the following income tax matters:
 
 
Gift Cards
The Company issues gift cards which contain no expiration date or inactivity fees. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30.4 million of revenue and operating income ($0.04 per share) related to gift card breakage at Bath & Body Works ($15.8 million) and Express ($14.6 million). The amount of gift card breakage recognized was based upon analysis of historical redemption patterns and represents the remaining balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption is remote. The fourth quarter of 2005 is the first period during which the Company has recognized gift card breakage. Therefore, the amount recognized includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since inception of the gift card programs at Bath & Body Works and Express. The Company will recognize gift card breakage at its other divisions once adequate historical data have been accumulated.
Summary of Impact of 2005 Significant Items
In order to aid investors' understanding of the Company's results and to improve comparability of financial information from period to period, explanatory reconciliation tables for 2005 and 2004 are included with this press release. Summarized earnings per share information for 2005 from these tables follows:
 
Note: Earnings per share totals for the fourth quarter do not add due to rounding differences, and the quarters do not add to the full year due to changes in weighted average shares outstanding.
2006 Outlook
In the first quarter of 2006, the Company expects roughly flat earnings per share versus $0.16 per share in 2005 (as restated under the cost method of inventory valuation, excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of $0.04 per share). The 2006 projection includes an estimated charge of $0.01 per share for the recognition of stock option expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, which the Company is adopting in the first quarter of 2006.
For 2006 (which is a 53-week year under the retail calendar), the Company expects earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50 versus 2005's $1.33 per share (as restated under the cost method of inventory valuation, and excluding the significant items described above). Excluding the estimated impact of stock option expense of $0.05 per share in 2006, the 2006 projection represents 9-17% earnings growth over 2005.
Share Repurchase Program
During the fourth quarter, the Company completed $158 million of its outstanding $200 million share repurchase program. Since the end of the quarter, the Company repurchased the $42 million remaining in the program. As part of its ongoing program to return value to its shareholders, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new $100 million program.

See Attached Notes to Consolidated Statements of Income and Reconciliation of Adjusted Results.
Adjusted results, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are presented in order to improve investors' understanding of historical and expected financial results and improve comparability of financial information from period to period. The "Adjusted Results" provided in the attached unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income and Reconciliation of Adjusted Results reflect the following:
Fiscal 2005
Adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 exclude the impact to net income related to the change from the retail method of inventory valuation to the cost method. For the full year, the change to the cost method resulted in an increase in net income of $13 million, or $0.03 per share. This includes a $17 million increase, or $0.04 per share, related to the cumulative impact of the change, offset by a $4 million decrease, or $0.01 per share, related to the full year operational impact of this change. For the fourth quarter of 2005, this change resulted in a decrease in the Company's Adjusted Results of $27 million, or $0.06 per share. See the attached Preliminary Restatement of 2005 Quarterly Consolidated Statements of Income for the impact of this change on quarterly results for 2005 and the attached Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Income for the pro forma impact of this change on full year results for 2005 and 2004.
Adjusted full year and fourth quarter 2005 results also exclude the following:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2004
In the first quarter of 2004, adjusted results exclude a $44.9 million pretax, non-operating gain resulting from the repayment of New York & Company's $75 million subordinated note and New York & Company's purchase of warrants held by Limited Brands. The note was repaid prior to its scheduled maturity of November 26, 2009. The warrants, representing approximately 13% of New York & Company's common equity held by Limited Brands, were purchased for $20 million. The note and warrants were part of the consideration received by Limited Brands for the sale of New York & Company in November 2002.
In the second quarter of 2004, adjusted results exclude a $17.6 million pretax, non-operating gain resulting from the sale of our remaining interest in Galyan's Trading Company.
In the third quarter of 2004, adjusted results exclude a $45.7 million pretax, non-operating gain related to proceeds that Limited Brands received in connection with New York & Company's initial public offering.
The Unaudited Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Income should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company's definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company. The Unaudited Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Income should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.
