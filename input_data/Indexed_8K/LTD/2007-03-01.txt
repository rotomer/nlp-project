Excluding the fourteenth week this year and the gift card breakage adjustment from last year, the sales increase from the comparable thirteen-week period last year was 10%.
Full Year Results
Earnings per share for the fifty-three week year ended February 3, 2007 were $1.68 compared to $1.62 (before cumulative effect of accounting change of $0.04 related to the change from the retail method of inventory valuation to the cost method) for the fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2006. Operating income was $1.176 billion compared to $985.8 million last year, and net income before cumulative effect of accounting changes was $675.0 million compared to $666.4 million last year.
Excluding the fourth quarter 2005 items totaling $0.29 mentioned above, earnings per share for the fifty-three week year ended February 3, 2007 were $1.68 compared to $1.33 (before cumulative effect of accounting change of $0.04) for the fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2006. Excluding the 2006 impact of $0.05 per share from the recognition of stock option expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, this represents an increase of 30%. Operating income was $1.176 billion compared to $955.4 million last year, and net income before cumulative effect of accounting changes was $675.0 million compared to $546.0 million last year.
The Company reported a comparable stores sales increase of 7% for the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2007, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended February 4, 2006. Net sales were $10.671 billion for the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2007 compared to $9.699 billion (including $30.4 million related to the previously mentioned gift card breakage adjustment) for the fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2006. Excluding sales from the fifty-third week this year and the gift card breakage adjustment from last year, net sales increased 9% from the comparable fifty-two week period last year.
2007 Outlook
The Company stated that it now expects February comps in the low to mid-single digit range versus its previous guidance for high single digit comps, due in part to weather conditions that negatively impacted Valentine's Day sales at Victoria's Secret, and, to a lesser extent, Bath & Body Works.
The Company stated that it expects 2007 first quarter earnings per share to be $0.25 to $0.28 compared to $0.25 per share last year.
For 2007, the Company expects earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.90, which represents 4% to 13% growth over 2006.
2005 Significant Items
As outlined above, 2005 fourth quarter and full year results include certain significant items. Further information is provided below.
Resolution of Income Tax Matters
The Company's results for the fourth quarter of 2005 include the impact of the following income tax matters:
 
 
Gift Cards
The Company issues gift cards which contain no expiration date or inactivity fees. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30.4 million of revenue and operating income ($0.04 per share) related to gift card breakage at Bath & Body Works ($15.8 million) and Express ($14.6 million). The amount of gift card breakage recognized was based upon analysis of historical redemption patterns and represents the remaining balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption is remote. The fourth quarter of 2005 is the first period during which the Company has recognized gift card breakage. Therefore, the amount recognized includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since inception of
the gift card programs at Bath & Body Works and Express. The Company will recognize gift card breakage at its other divisions once adequate historical data have been accumulated.
