Section 2.07

Assets included as Appendix 2.04(a) (i.e., the amount shown thereon of $326,322,000) and (iii) the fact of the difference between the negotiated amount of Base Net Tangible Assets referred to in clause (i) and the calculated amount described in clause (ii) will not influence or affect in any respect the calculation of Closing Net Tangible Assets.

(c)
If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 9.04 is asserted against the Company, any Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates, the Company, the Subsidiary or the Affiliate shall notify Seller of such claim or demand within 10 days of receipt thereof, or such earlier time that would allow Seller to timely respond to such claim or demand, and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request. Seller may discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation under this Section 9.04 by paying to the Company, the Subsidiary or the Affiliate the amount of the applicable Tax Loss, calculated on the date of such payment subject to the approval of Buyer. Seller shall have the right to assume and control at its own expense, and the Company, the Subsidiary or the Affiliate shall take all steps reasonably requested by Seller in order to fully effectuate Seller's assumption and control of, the conduct of any contest or proceeding (including, without limitation, a Tax audit) relating to Federal Taxes, Combined Taxes or any other Taxes for which indemnification may be sought from Seller under this Section 9.04.

Seller shall not settle or conclude any
such contest or proceeding addressed by this Section 9.04(c) without Buyer's approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, if the settlement or proposed resolution of such contest or proceeding could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company, any Subsidiary, Buyer or its Affiliates for any taxable period beginning or portion thereof after the Closing Date. Seller shall not be liable under this Section 9.04 for any amount arising out of a contest or proceeding of which Seller was not notified as required under this Section 9.04(c) to the extent that the failure to so notify Seller prejudiced Seller.
     
(d)
Notwithstanding Section 9.04(a), if Seller's indemnification obligation under this Section 9.04 arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to the Company, any Subsidiary, or any of its Affiliates any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (a "
Tax Benefit
") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then the Company, its Affiliate or any Subsidiary, as applicable, shall pay over to Seller the tax savings attributable to such Tax Benefit (calculated on a with-and-without basis) as and when realized by the Company, its Affiliate or any Subsidiary, as applicable; provided, however, that the amount paid to Seller pursuant to this provision with respect to any indemnification obligation shall not exceed the amount paid by Seller pursuant to Section 9.04(a) with respect to such indemnification obligation.

The party seeking indemnification under Section 12.02 (the "
Indemnified Party
") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "
Indemnifying Party
") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding ("
Claim
") in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
     
(b)
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim asserted by any third party ("
Third Party Claim
") and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its expense; provided that Limited Brands or its Affiliates shall control the defense of, and appoint the lead counsel in connection with, the Retained Litigation.
     
(c)
If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.
     
(d)
Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
     
(e)
Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with applicable Law any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit (or, if less, the amount of any such loss previously paid by the Indemnifying Party) to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received.
     
(f)
Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 12.02.
     
Section 12.04
. Limitation on Damages.
     
(a)
The amount of any Damages payable under Section 12.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies and (ii) the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages (net of any Tax detriment arising from receipt of any indemnification payment).
     
(b)
The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 12.02 for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) there is included in the Closing Statement of Net Tangible Assets an identifiable liability or reserve (including liabilities or reserves that are not individual line items, but are identifiable components of a line item) specifically relating to such matter (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the excess of the Damages over such identifiable liability or reserve) or (B) the Indemnified Party had otherwise been compensated for such matter pursuant to the purchase price adjustment mechanism contemplated by Section 2.04 and Section 2.05 (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the excess of the Damages over such purchase price adjustment compensation), (ii) special, punitive, indirect or consequential Damages (including diminution in value of the Sold Units) or (iii) Damages for lost profits.
     
(c)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Damages shall be determined or increased based on any multiple of any financial measure (including earnings, sales or other benchmarks) that might have been used by Buyer in the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their businesses and operations.
     
Section 12.05
. Assignment of Claims.
If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 12.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (other than from the Company, any Subsidiary, any Affiliate of the Company or any current or former employee or agent of any such Persons) (a "
Potential Contributor
") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

In accordance with its long-standing strategy to enhance shareholder value by sharpening its focus and simplifying its structure, Limited Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LTD) today announced a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in its Express brand and an intent to explore strategic options for Limited Stores.
Columbus, Ohio, May 15, 2007 
Our strategic agenda focuses on growth in the intimate apparel, and personal care and beauty segments of our business. The new ownership structure for Express will provide it with the resources, leadership focus and capital to maximize its potential. stated Leslie H. Wexner, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Consistent with our past practices, we intend to return excess cash to shareholders.  We will also engage in a complete review of our SG&A expenses with a view to a resizing and realignment that is appropriate for the size and complexity of our new enterprise structure.
Express
Limited Brands announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with affiliates of Golden Gate Capital to sell a 67% ownership interest in its Express brand for cash proceeds of $548 million. The Company expects that after-tax cash proceeds will approximate $425 million, subject to any post closing adjustment.   The transaction is expected to close no later than July 6, and is subject to customary conditions.
th
Mr. Wexner added, We have been very encouraged by the progress and improved performance that Express has demonstrated over the last year and a half.  We continue to believe in Express and its potential. In fact, we structured this transaction specifically in order to continue to participate in the growth of Express through our 33% ownership interest.
Jay Margolis will lead Express as its Chief Executive Officer.  Express will continue to operate under the same brand name.  It will remain headquartered in its current location in Columbus, Ohio and current management and associates are expected to remain with the brand.  Express 2006 net sales were $1.7 billion and it currently has 631 store locations.
 
Limited Stores
The Company also announced that it is exploring strategic options for its Limited Stores business. The Company has not established a timetable for the completion of this process.  Limited Stores 2006 net sales were $493 million and it currently has 253 store locations.
2007 Earnings Outlook
The Company stated that it now expects 2007 first quarter earnings to be $0.12 to $0.14, versus its initial guidance of $0.25 to $0.28, and $0.25 last year.  The decrease versus initial expectations was driven by lower-than-anticipated sales and merchandise margins at each of its brands in the first quarter, particularly Victorias Secret.
The Company expects that trends will continue to be challenging in the second quarter, especially at Victorias Secret, and therefore estimates 2007 second quarter earnings per share to be $0.20 to $0.24 compared to $0.28 per share last year.  This estimate does not include any impact from the Express transaction or potential strategic options for Limited Stores.
For the full year 2007, the Company now expects earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65, versus its initial guidance of $1.75 to $1.90.  This estimate does not include any impact from the Express transaction or potential strategic options for Limited Stores.
