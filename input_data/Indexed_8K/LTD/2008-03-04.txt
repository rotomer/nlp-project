For 2008, the company expects earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.55.
Gift Cards
The company issues gift cards which contain no expiration date or inactivity fees. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the company recognized $47.8 million of revenue and operating income ($0.08 per share) related to gift card breakage at Victoria's Secret. The amount of gift card breakage recognized was based upon analysis of historical redemption patterns and represents the remaining balance of gift cards for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption is remote. The fourth quarter of 2007 is the first period during which the company has recognized gift card breakage for Victoria's Secret. Therefore, the amount recognized includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since inception of the gift card program at Victoria's Secret. The company began recognizing gift card breakage at Bath & Body Works in the fourth quarter of 2005.
