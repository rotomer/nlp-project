2010 Outlook
Chairman and CEO Leslie Wexner stated, "The economic environment in 2009 was very challenging. We managed inventory, expenses and capital conservatively. We focused on executing with flexibility and speed, and those disciplines helped us achieve better results in the fourth quarter. We made good progress, but we recognize there is more to do and are very focused on continued improvement."
The company's earnings forecast is based on various assumptions which will be discussed more fully on the earnings conference call. The company expects 2010 full-year earnings per share to be between $1.40 and $1.60 per share, including earnings per share between $0.05 per share and $0.10 per share in the first quarter.
The company expects to report a February comparable store sales increase in the high single to low double digit range, versus its previous estimate of roughly flat.
