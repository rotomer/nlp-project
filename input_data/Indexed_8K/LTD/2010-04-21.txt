Since January 31, 2009, Limited Brands has repaid or refinanced over $800 million in debt maturing in 2012. This transaction allows us to further extend our maturity profile by refinancing another $300 million of debt maturing in 2012 and 2014.
The Tender Offers consist of two offers, both commencing today. The first offer is for the purchase of any and all of the 2012 Notes (the "Any and All Offer"). The second offer is for the purchase of the 2014 Notes (the "Maximum Tender Offer") in an aggregate principal amount of the Tender Cap remaining following the purchase of the 2012 Notes in the Any and All Offer. Both offers will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 17, 2010, unless such date is extended or the tender offer is earlier terminated (the "Any and All Offer Expiration Date" and the "Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date," as applicable). The Tender Offers are conditioned upon the consummation of the sale of the 2020 Notes in an aggregate principal amount on substantially the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, in each case, satisfactory to us, in our sole discretion.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Any and All Offer, holders who validly tender their 2012 Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 3, 2010 (the "Early Tender Date"), unless such date is extended or the applicable offer is terminated, will be entitled to receive $1,080, payable in cash, for each $1,000 principal amount of 2012 Notes accepted for payment, which amount includes an early tender payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount. The Any and All Offer contemplates an early settlement option and holders whose 2012 Notes are tendered and accepted for purchase could receive payment as early as May 4, 2010.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Maximum Tender Offer, holders who validly tender their 2014 Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 3, 2010 (the "Early Tender Date"), unless such date is extended or the offer is terminated, will be entitled to receive $1,040, payable in cash, for each $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes accepted for payment, which amount includes an early tender payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount. The Maximum Tender Offer does not contemplate an early settlement option.
Holders who validly tender their 2012 Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Any and All Offer Expiration Date will receive $1,050 per $1,000 principal amount of 2012 Notes accepted for purchase. Holders who validly tender their 2014 Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date will receive $1,010 per $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes accepted for purchase. Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will also receive accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date. The Maximum Tender Offer is subject to proration in the event 2014 Notes are validly tendered in excess of the Tender Cap
The terms and conditions of the Tender Offers are set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated April 20, 2010 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the related Letter of Transmittal dated the same (the "Letter of Transmittal"). Limited Brands may amend, extend or terminate the Tender Offers.
