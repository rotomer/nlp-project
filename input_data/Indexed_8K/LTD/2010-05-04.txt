Pursuant to their terms, the Tender Offers will remain open until their respective tender offer expiration dates, each May 17, 2010, at which point any newly tendered 2012 Notes will be settled in full and the tendered 2014 Notes will be prorated before settlement so that the company does not exceed the Tender Cap.
