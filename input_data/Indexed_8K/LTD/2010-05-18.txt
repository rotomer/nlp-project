The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of 2012 Notes validly tendered in the Any and All Offer after the Early Tender Date, but at or prior to the Expiration, and accepted for purchase was $1,050 (the 2012 Notes Late Tender Offer Consideration), which was the 2012 Notes Total Consideration minus the 2012 Notes Early Tender Payment.
The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes validly tendered in the Maximum Tender Offer prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Early Tender Date, and accepted for purchase is $1,040 (the 2014 Notes Total Consideration), which includes an early tender payment of $30 (the 2014 Notes Early Tender Payment). The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes validly tendered in the Maximum Tender Offer after the Early Tender Date, but at or prior to the Expiration, and accepted for purchase is $1,010 (the 2014 Notes Late Tender Offer Consideration), which is the 2014 Notes Total Consideration minus the 2014 Notes Early Tender Payment.
