At the conclusion of this press release is a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results.
2010 Outlook
The company stated that it expects 2010 third quarter earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.08 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 per share last year. The company now expects August comparable store sales to increase in the mid to high single digit range versus its previous guidance for a low single digit increase.
For 2010, the company increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to $1.68 to $1.83 from $1.60 to $1.80 previously.
The company's earnings forecast was impacted versus its previous forecast by a change in accounting methodology for its investment in Express as a result of the company's decreased ownership percentage and other factors, the sale of its remaining interest in Limited Stores and an increase in its estimated tax rate from 38 percent to 39.5 percent. These changes decreased the third quarter forecast by approximately $0.02 per share and the full-year forecast by approximately $0.08 per share.
