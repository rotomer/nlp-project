Third Quarter Results
Earnings per share for the third quarter ended Oct. 30, 2010, were $0.18 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 for the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2009, which exclude an income tax benefit in 2009 as detailed below. Third quarter operating income was $149.1 million compared to operating income of $58.9 million last year, and net income was $61.3 million compared to adjusted net income of $6.1 million last year.
The 2009 adjusted results above exclude an income tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters, of $8.8 million, or $0.03 per share. Including this benefit, 2009 net income was $14.9 million and earnings per share were $0.05.
Comparable store sales for the third quarter increased 10 percent, and net sales were $1.983 billion compared to $1.777 billion last year.
At the conclusion of this press release is a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results.
2010 Outlook
The company stated that it expects fourth quarter earnings of $1.02 to $1.17 per share. For 2010, the company increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to $1.82 to $1.97 from $1.68 to $1.83 previously.
Special Dividend and Share Repurchase Program
The company announced that its Board of Directors has declared a special dividend of $3 per share and has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program.
Leslie H. Wexner, chairman and chief executive officer, stated, "The significant increase in our year-to-date earnings and the continued disciplined management of inventory, capital spending and our capital structure have resulted in a very strong cash and liquidity position. We are confident in our ability to deliver substantial growth in our business and to generate significant free cash flow. We have been and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of ongoing regular dividends, share repurchases and special dividends."
The company expects 2010 free cash flow of approximately $800 million and a year-end cash balance, after the payment of the special dividend, of approximately $750 million. With this distribution, the company has returned $10 billion to shareholders since 2000, an amount roughly equal to the company's current market capitalization.
The special dividend will be paid on Dec. 21, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 7, 2010. Share repurchases will be made at the times, in the amounts and in the manner that the company believes appropriate.
