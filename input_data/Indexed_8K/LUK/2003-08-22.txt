Item 5. Other Events. ------------ On August 21, 2003, Leucadia National Corporation ("Leucadia") and WilTel Communications Group, Inc. ("WilTel") issued a joint press release announcing board approval and execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the merger of a subsidiary of Leucadia into WilTel, with WilTel as the surviving corporation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Leucadia will first commence an exchange offer in which tendering WilTel stockholders will receive 0.4242 of a Leucadia common share and one contingent sale right for each share of WilTel common stock tendered in the offer. The exchange offer, if consummated, will be followed by a back-end merger for the same consideration as offered in the exchange offer. In general, the contingent sale rights give WilTel stockholders the opportunity to receive additional Leucadia common shares if Leucadia sells substantially all of WilTel's assets or outstanding shares of capital stock prior to October 15, 2004 (which Leucadia has no plans to do) and the net proceeds from such sale exceeds the valuation in this transaction accorded to WilTel's equity. Consummation of the transaction is subject to the condition that there be validly tendered (and not withdrawn) at least a majority of the shares of WilTel's outstanding common stock not owned by Leucadia, receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. A copy of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and the press release are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 99.1, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. 2

ANNEX A Conditions to the Offer iii
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 21, 2003 (the "Execution Date"), among LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("Parent"), WRANGLER ACQUISITION CORP., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and WILTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.11. WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each deems it advisable that Parent acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement; WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof it is proposed that such acquisition be accomplished by (a) Parent commencing an exchange offer to acquire all of the shares of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding (each, a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares") that are not beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) by Parent (each, a "Public Share" and, collectively, the "Public Shares"), in which exchange offer each Public Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn would be exchanged for (i) 0.4242 (such exchange ratio, or any greater exchange ratio, per Public Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio") of a common share, $1.00 par value, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (such amount of shares, or any greater amount of shares, of Parent Common Stock paid per Public Share pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Base Offer Consideration") and (ii) one Contingent Sale Right having the terms described in Section 2.11 hereof (as it may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, a "CSR" and, together with the Base Offer Consideration, the "Offer Consideration"), in each case, subject to any required withholding of taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such exchange offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer"), and (b) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS"), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain shares as provided in Section 2.7(b) hereof) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration, subject to any required withholding of taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger"); WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Offer and the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent (on its own behalf and as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub), Merger Sub and the Company have each adopted this Agreement and approved the Offer and the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 2
ARTICLE I - THE OFFER 1.1 The Offer. (a) Provided that (i) none of the events or circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be existing (and shall not have been waived by Parent) and (ii) the Company shall have complied with its obligations under Section 1.2 hereof, Parent shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date, but in no event later than 10 business days after the Execution Date. (b) The obligation of Parent to accept for exchange, and to exchange the Offer Consideration for, Public Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only (i) to the satisfaction of the condition that at the expiration of the Offer there be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer (other than Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred) and not withdrawn that number of Public Shares which represents more than 50% of the Public Shares then outstanding, subject to Section 1.1(g) hereof the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent) of the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions (other than the Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in clause (vi) of the second paragraph of Annex A hereto), to increase the consideration per Public Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the Company which decreases the Exchange Ratio for the Offer from that set forth in the second "Whereas" clause hereof (or decreases the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the CSRs), changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be acquired in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, waives the Minimum Condition or the condition set forth in clause (vi) of the second paragraph of Annex A hereto, or modifies or amends any of the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto or makes other changes in the terms of the Offer that are in any manner adverse to the holders of Public Shares or, except as provided below, extends the expiration date of the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may (A) extend the Offer beyond the initial scheduled expiration date, which shall be 20 business days following the date of commencement of the Offer, or any subsequent scheduled expiration date, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to Parent's obligation to accept for exchange, and to exchange the Offer Consideration for, Public Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived, subject, however, to the parties' respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, and (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Each extension of the Offer pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence shall not exceed the lesser of ten business days (or such longer period as the Company and Parent may agree in writing in any particular instance) or such fewer number of days that Parent reasonably believes are necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto to be satisfied. In addition, if, at the expiration date of the Offer, all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived by Parent) but the number of Public Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken together with Shares, if any, then beneficially owned by Parent, constitutes less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding, without the consent of the Company, Parent shall (subject to applicable law) have the right to provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as 3
contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for up to 20 business days after Parent's acceptance for exchange of the Public Shares then tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, in which event Parent shall (I) give the required notice of such subsequent offering period and (II) immediately accept for exchange, and promptly exchange the Offer Consideration for, all Public Shares tendered and not withdrawn as of such expiration date. (c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto as of any expiration date of the Offer, Parent shall accept for exchange, and exchange the Offer Consideration (subject to any required withholding of taxes) for, all Public Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after it is permitted to do so under applicable law. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would have been received by such stockholder) will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined), on behalf of such holders, of the aggregated fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this paragraph. Promptly following the Purchase Date, (i) the Exchange Agent shall determine the total amount of the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which all such tendering stockholders would otherwise be entitled, and aggregate the same into whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share), (ii) Parent shall issue such whole shares of Parent Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, as agent for such tendering stockholders, and (iii) the Exchange Agent shall sell such shares of Parent Common Stock at the then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange through one or more member firms of the New York Stock Exchange (which sales shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable). Until the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to such tendering stockholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. Promptly after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such holders in lieu of any fractional interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall pay such amounts to such holders (subject to any required withholding of taxes). (e) The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered to Parent pursuant to the Offer. (f) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent shall file with the SEC (i) a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4 to register, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement shall include a prospectus (the "Prospectus") containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Schedule TO shall include or contain as an exhibit an offer to exchange and 4
form of the related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively with the Prospectus, and together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto and to the Prospectus, the "Offer Documents "). Parent shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Public Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent shall cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Public Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Public Shares. In addition, Parent agrees to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, to consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and to provide the Company with copies of all such responses, whether written or oral. Following the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, Parent shall file the final prospectus included therein under Rule 424(b) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. (g) If none of the Shares held by the securities holder channeling fund established in connection with Second Amended and Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization of Williams Communications Group, Inc. and CG Austria Inc. are validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn at the expiration of the Offer, then the Shares in such fund shall be deemed not outstanding for purposes of the Minimum Condition. 1.2 Company Actions. (a) The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) adopted this Agreement and approved the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and (ii) resolved (subject to Section 5.2 hereof) to recommend that holders of Public Shares accept the Offer, tender their Public Shares to Parent pursuant thereto and approve this Agreement. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors described in the immediately preceding sentence. The Company hereby further represents and warrants that (A) the Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion of JP Morgan, dated the Execution Date, to the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of the Public Shares in the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view (the "Fairness Opinion") and (B) the Company has been authorized by JPMorgan to permit the inclusion of the Fairness Opinion and/or references thereto in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any Proxy Statement, subject to prior review and consent by JPMorgan (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in Section 1.2(a). The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the 5
Public Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Public Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Public Shares. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, to consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether written or oral. (c) The Company agrees (i) to promptly upon Parent's request provide all information about the Company required to be disclosed in the Offer Documents, (ii) to promptly deliver to Parent a duly executed consent of the Company's accountants to allow Parent to include in the Registration Statement the Company's financial statements and such accountants' report thereon, (iii) that all information provided by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents will not (at the respective times such materials, or any amendments or supplements thereto, are filed with the SEC, first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, the Offer expires or shares of Parent Common Stock are delivered in connection with the Offer, or at the Effective Time, as the case may be) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (iv) to promptly correct any information provided by the Company for the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. (d) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Parent with such additional information, including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. 1.3 Stockholder Meeting. (a) As promptly as practicable following the acquisition of Public Shares pursuant to the Offer, if required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company's stockholders for the purposes of considering and taking action upon the approval of this Agreement (the "Company Shareholders Meeting"); and 6
(ii) in consultation with Parent, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and obtain and furnish the information required by the SEC to be included therein and, after consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and cause a definitive proxy or information statement (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Proxy Statement") to be mailed to the Company's stockholders at the earliest practicable date; provided that no amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without consultation with Parent. Parent shall provide the Company with such information with respect to Parent and its directors and officers as shall be required to be included in the Proxy Statement. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.3(a), in the event that Parent and its subsidiaries shall acquire in the aggregate at least 90% of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto shall, subject to Article VI hereof, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 92A.180 of the NRS.

2.4 Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the NRS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, each of (i) the Stockholders Rights and Co-Sale Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2002, between Parent and the Company and (ii) the Stockholders Agreement (as hereinafter defined) shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. 2.5 Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, (a) the articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such articles of incorporation, and (b) the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such by-laws. 2.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company, respectively, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 2.7 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of Merger Sub or the Company: (a) Each then issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.0l par value, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Any Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and all Shares owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. (c) Each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.7(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)), shall be converted into the right to receive (A) one CSR and (B) the Exchange Ratio of a share of Parent Common Stock, issuable to the holder thereof upon surrender, in the manner provided in this Agreement, of the certificate formerly representing such Share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.8(b), without interest. 8
2.8 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.7 in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(c), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 2.8(c) or (e). 9
(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.8(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect to Parent Common Stock prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.8(f), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to such a fractional share interest (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would have been received by such holder) will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of such holders, of the aggregated fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this paragraph. Promptly following the Effective Time, (i) the Exchange Agent shall determine the total amount of the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which all such former Company stockholders would otherwise be entitled, and aggregate the same into whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share), (ii) Parent shall issue such whole shares of Parent Common Stock to the Exchange 10
Agent, as agent for such former stockholders, and (iii) the Exchange Agent shall sell such shares of Parent Common Stock at the then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange through one or more member firms of the New York Stock Exchange (which sales shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable). Until the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to such former stockholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. Promptly after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such former stockholders in lieu of any fractional interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall pay such amounts to such former stockholders (subject to any required withholding of taxes). (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration (and dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration (and dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.8(e)) in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any CSRs or any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(e), in each case pursuant to this Agreement. (i) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the Exchange Agent will be treated as though it withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding is required an appropriate amount otherwise 11
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock in order to provide for such withholding obligation. If withholding is required from shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority. 2.9 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under Section 92A.380 of the NRS in respect of the Merger, then Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Sections 92A.300 through 92A.500 (inclusive) of the NRS and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the NRS (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted as described in Section 2.7(c) hereof, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 92A.380 of the NRS; provided, that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the NRS, such holder's Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, as described in Section 2.7(c), into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the NRS and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the NRS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any funds paid to holders of Dissenting Shares shall be paid solely out of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall not contribute funds to Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to fund payments to holders of Dissenting Shares, assume the Surviving Corporation's obligation to make such payment, or otherwise reimburse the Surviving Corporation, directly or indirectly, for such payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.8 to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. 2.10 Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if between the Execution Date and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction. 2.11 CSRs. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the consideration payable by Parent per share of Company Common Stock in the Offer and Merger will include one CSR. As described in greater detail below, the purpose of the CSRs is to give Company stockholders who participate in the Offer and Merger the opportunity to receive additional Parent Common Stock in connection with any Sale of the Company (as hereinafter defined) consummated after the Effective Time and on or before the Maturity Date (as hereinafter defined) in which Parent or its subsidiaries receive Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) in excess of the Deal Price (as hereinafter defined). 12
(b) The CSRs will be uncertificated contract rights and will be non-assignable and non-transferable by any holder thereof, except as required by any applicable community property laws or laws of descent and distribution. (c) The CSRs will become effective at the Effective Time and will mature at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the earlier of (i) the date, if any, on which a Sale of the Company for Net Proceeds in excess of the Deal Price is consummated and (ii) October 15, 2004, provided that if after the Effective Time and prior to the first anniversary of the Execution Date Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have entered into a definitive agreement with an unaffiliated third party providing for a Sale of the Company (a "Sale Contract"), the date in this clause (ii) shall be the later of (A) October 15, 2004 and (B) the earlier of (x) the date the Sale of the Company pursuant to such Sale Contract is consummated and (y) the date such Sale of the Company is abandoned (the earlier of (i) and (ii) being the "Maturity Date"). For purposes of the CSRs, "Sale of the Company" means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a sale by the Surviving Corporation of all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to another entity (other than Parent or one or more of its subsidiaries ("Permitted Holders")), including any such sale of assets to a Permitted Holder that is done as part of a related sale of such assets to an entity that is not a Permitted Holder; (ii) any "person" or "group", other than Permitted Holders, is or becomes the "beneficial owner", directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation having general voting power under ordinary circumstances ("Voting Stock"); or (iii) the Surviving Corporation consolidates with, or merges with or into, another Person (other than a Permitted Holder), other than any such transaction where (A) the outstanding Voting Stock of the Surviving Corporation is converted into or exchanged for voting securities of the surviving entity and (B) immediately after such transaction Permitted Holders are the "beneficial owners", directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the surviving entity. For purposes of this definition, the term "beneficial owner" is used as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act and the terms "person" or "group" are used as such terms are used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, only the consummation of the transactions described above in this definition shall constitute a "Sale of the Company" and neither any discussions, negotiations or preparations, nor entering into any agreement, relating to any such transaction shall be deemed a "Sale of the Company". (d) If there is consummated after the Effective Time and on or before the Maturity Date a Sale of the Company for Net Proceeds in excess of the Deal Price, then, following the Maturity Date, Parent will issue for each CSR that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all CSRs held by the holder thereof) determined under the following formula (calculated to the fourth decimal point) and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 2.11: 13
Sale Profit ------------------------- divided by Parent Price 50,000,000 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall more than a total of the Cap Number (as hereinafter defined) of shares of Parent Common Stock be issuable in respect of all CSRs in the aggregate, and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each CSR holder shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to give effect to this limitation where, "Sale Profit" means the amount of Net Proceeds in excess of the Deal Price; "Net Proceeds" means the US$ amount (expressed as a whole number) of aggregate proceeds (with any non-cash proceeds to be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Parent) received by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries in respect of a Sale of the Company consummated after the Effective Time and on or before the Maturity Date, plus the fair market value (to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Parent) of any assets of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries retained by Parent upon consummation of such Sale of the Company, net of (i) the costs relating to such transaction (including, without limitation, regulatory filing fees, legal, accounting and investment banking fees, and brokerage and sales commissions), (ii) taxes paid or payable as a result of such transaction, (iii) amounts required to be applied to the repayment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on any indebtedness required to be paid as a result of such transaction, (iv) deduction of appropriate amounts to be provided as a reserve in accordance with GAAP against any liabilities associated with such transaction (including, without limitation, pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities and liabilities related to environmental matters or against any indemnification obligations associated with such transaction) and (v) all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries that are retained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries following consummation of such transaction; "Deal Price" equals (A) 800,000,000, plus (B) the aggregate US$ amount (expressed as a whole number) of contributions to capital and other investments made by Parent or any of its affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) in, and expenditures funded by Parent or any of its affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) in support of, the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries after the Effective Time and prior to the Maturity Date, minus (C) the aggregate US$ amount (expressed as a whole number) of dividends paid by the Surviving Corporation to Parent after the Effective Time and prior to the Maturity Date, plus (D) an amount equal to notional interest on the excess, if any, of (i) the amounts described in clause (B) above over (ii) the amount described in clause (C) above, at a rate per annum of 8%, determined based on the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the Maturity Date and a 360-day year; "Parent Price" equals 37.72, reduced to reflect the amount (if any) of cash dividends per share of Parent Common Stock paid (or with a record date) between the Execution Date and the Maturity Date in excess of Parent's regular $0.25 per share annual dividend; and 14
"Cap Number" means the lesser of (A) 11,000,000 and (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent in the Offer and the Merger (excluding consideration paid to holders of Dissenting Shares) minus one. (e) If, on the Maturity Date, Net Proceeds are equal to or less than the Deal Price, the CSRs shall automatically terminate and no consideration shall be deliverable in respect thereof. If, on the Maturity Date, the amount determined pursuant to the formula in Section 2.11(d) above is greater than zero, Parent will thereafter issue to each CSR holder the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled as herein described (rounded down to the nearest whole share, after aggregating all CSRs held by such holder), and the CSRs shall be automatically cancelled. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if between the Effective Time and the Maturity Date the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, then the number of and kind of shares issuable in respect of the CSRs shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction. (g) If shares of Parent Common Stock become issuable under the CSRs, Parent will determine the amount required under applicable tax laws to be treated as interest income, and may, at its option, issue two stock certificates to each holder of CSRs, one certificate in respect of the shares treated as interest and the other certificate in respect of the remaining shares; provided, however, that in no event will Leucadia issue any fractional share interests. (h) All computations and determinations relating to the CSRs shall be made by Parent in good faith. Promptly after the Maturity Date, Parent shall notify holders of CSRs in writing (which notification may be made through a press release which will be attached to a submission that is made publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR system) of Parent's determination as to (i) whether a Sale of the Company occurred after the Effective Time and on or before the Maturity Date, (ii) the amount of any Net Proceeds received in respect thereof, (iii) the amount (if any) of any resulting Sale Profit, and (iv) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) due and payable to CSR holders under this Agreement ((i) through (iv) collectively, the "Relevant Determinations"). Following such notice, CSR holders shall have 180 days to communicate to Parent in writing any objections to Parent's determination of the Relevant Determinations; provided that a CSR holder may object to Parent's determinations only (A) on the basis that Parent's determinations, including determinations regarding fair market value in the definition of "Net Proceeds" being made in good faith, were not made in accordance with this Agreement, (B) to the extent that if such holder's objection was upheld, Parent would be required to issue an aggregate of at least 25,000 more shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of the CSRs than would be issuable according to Parent's determinations and (C) if the bases for such holder's objection are specified in writing and in reasonable detail (an "Objection Notice"). If Parent receives one or more Objection Notices, then Parent and the CSR holders who delivered such Objection Notice shall discuss the objections set forth therein in good faith and Parent agrees, and each CSR holder, by accepting a CSR agrees, to use all reasonable efforts to 15
ensure that any final resolution of such objections will be applicable to, and binding on, all CSR holders (and not only those CSR holders who objected to Parent's determinations). If shares are issued or other amounts are paid in settlement of one or more Objection Notices, then all objecting and non-objecting CSR holders shall, to the extent practicable, be treated equally by Parent and receive the same amount and form of consideration as the objecting CSR holders, based on and in proportion to the number of CSRs held by each such holder. If any such objections are not resolved by the date that is 270 days after the Maturity Date, then Parent and the CSR holders shall submit the matter to an Agreed Court for resolution through appropriate proceedings, provided that Parent and such holders shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that such proceedings are conducted as a class action such that any final resolution in such proceedings will be applicable to, and binding on, all CSR holders (and not only those CSR holders who objected to Parent's determinations), provided further that, if class action status is not available for such proceedings, Parent agrees, and each CSR holder, by accepting a CSR agrees, to use all reasonable efforts to ensure that any final resolution in such proceedings will be applicable to, and binding on, all CSR holders (and not only those CSR holders who objected to Parent's determinations). By accepting a CSR, each CSR holder irrevocably waives any rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding related to the CSRs. (i) The holder of a CSR will not be entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder in Parent (including, without limitation, voting and dividend rights). (j) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date before the Maturity Date will be paid in respect of, and no interest will be paid or will accrue on, any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of CSRs. None of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of CSRs delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent shall be free to conduct its business (including, without limitation, all decisions relating to whether, when, how and for what consideration to dispose of any assets) as it in its sole discretion shall determine. ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 3.1 Organization.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean, with respect to any party, a state of facts, effect, event or change which has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, net assets, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. 16

For those amounts of directors' and officers' liability insurance in excess of the insurance described in the preceding sentence which are currently provided under the Company's other current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (the "Other Policies"), for a six year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make payments to those persons who are currently covered by such Other Policies to the extent such payments otherwise would have been made under such Other Policies (as in effect on the Execution Date) had such Other Policies remained in effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the maximum amount of payments that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to make shall not exceed $50 million in the aggregate.

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, identify the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

Exhibit 99.1 LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND WILTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC. ANNOUNCE SIGNING OF MERGER AGREEMENT NEW YORK - (BUSINESS WIRE) - August 21, 2003 -- Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE and PCX: LUK) ("Leucadia") and WilTel Communications Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:WTEL) ("WilTel") today announced board approval and execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the merger of a subsidiary of Leucadia into WilTel, with WilTel as the surviving corporation. This announcement follows a joint announcement by Leucadia and WilTel on August 12, 2003 of an agreement in principle regarding this merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Leucadia will first commence an exchange offer in which tendering WilTel stockholders will receive 0.4242 of a Leucadia common share and one contingent sale right for each share of WilTel common stock tendered in the offer. The exchange offer, if consummated, will be followed by a back-end merger for the same consideration as offered in the exchange offer. In general, the contingent sale rights give WilTel stockholders the opportunity to receive additional Leucadia common shares if Leucadia sells substantially all of WilTel's assets or outstanding shares of capital stock prior to October 15, 2004 (which Leucadia has no plans to do) and the net proceeds from such sale exceeds the valuation in this transaction accorded to WilTel's equity. The Board of Directors of WilTel, acting on the recommendation of a special committee composed of independent directors, approved and adopted the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that WilTel stockholders accept the offer, tender their WilTel common stock in the offer and, if required, approve the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan Securities, the special committee's financial advisor, has opined that, subject to customary assumptions, the merger consideration is fair from a financial point of view to WilTel's stockholders other than Leucadia and its affiliates. Consummation of the transaction is subject to the condition that there be validly tendered (and not withdrawn) at least a majority of the shares of WilTel's outstanding common stock not owned by Leucadia, receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. This press release may contain "forward-looking statements" as defined by federal law. Although Leucadia and WilTel believe any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. Leucadia and WilTel assume no obligation to update those statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions and other factors. The forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Additional information that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") made by Leucadia and WilTel. Leucadia National Corporation is a holding company engaged in a variety of businesses, including telecommunications (principally through its 47.4% interest in WilTel), banking and lending (principally through American Investment Bank, N.A.), manufacturing (through its Plastics Division), real estate activities, winery operations, development of a copper mine (through its 72.8% interest in MK Gold Company) and property and casualty reinsurance. Leucadia currently has
equity interests of more than 5% in the following domestic public companies: AmeriKing, Inc. (6.8%), Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (11%), GFSI Holdings, Inc. (6.9%), The FINOVA Group, Inc. (indirectly 25% through its interest in Berkadia), HomeFed Corporation (30.3%), Jackson Products, Inc. (8.8%), Jordan Industries, Inc. (10.1%), ParkerVision, Inc. (7.4%) and WilTel (47.4%). WilTel Communications Group, Inc., through its operating subsidiary WilTel Communications, LLC, provides data, voice and media transport solutions to a growing carrier-class customer base with complex communications needs. Such customers include leading global telecommunications and media and entertainment companies -- companies where bandwidth is either their primary business or a core component of the products and services they deliver. WilTel's advanced network infrastructure reaches border-to-border and coast- to-coast with international connectivity to accommodate global traffic. Leucadia will file an amended Schedule 13D with the SEC, which shareholders can obtain free of charge from the SEC's website at http:www.sec.gov. This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Any offer will only be made through a prospectus, which is part of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC. WilTel stockholders are urged to carefully read the registration statement and the prospectus included therein, together with the Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9 and other documents relating to the exchange offer when they become available because these documents will contain important information relating to the offer. You may obtain a free copy of these documents after they have been filed with the SEC at the SEC's website at http:www.sec.gov. Once a registration statement, as well as any documents incorporated by reference therein and a Schedule TO and Schedule 14D-9 have been filed with the SEC, you will also be able to inspect and copy these documents at the public reference room maintained by the SEC at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20549. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE PROSPECTUS, THE TENDER OFFER STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE TO AND MANAGEMENT'S SOLICITATION / RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9 WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION CONCERNING THE OFFER. 2
