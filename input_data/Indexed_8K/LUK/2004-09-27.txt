Section 8 - Other Events Item 8.01 Other Events. Leucadia National Corporation had previously disclosed that it had filed a notification and report pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with respect to acquiring 50% or more of the outstanding common stock of MCI Inc., a telecommunications company (formerly known as WorldCom Inc.), that the waiting period had expired on August 9, 2004, and that it owned 15,738,100 shares of MCI common stock for an aggregate investment of approximately $245.9 million. The Company has sold its interest in MCI stock for an aggregate pre-tax gain of approximately $20 million (inclusive of dividends received), which will be reflected in the Company's third quarter results of operations. The Company's sale of MCI stock should not be interpreted to mean that the Company is no longer interested in acquiring control of MCI, but no assurance can be given that the Company will acquire control of MCI. 2
