Section 1- Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On September 24, 2004, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, WilTel Communications Group, Inc., and certain of its subsidiaries ("WilTel") refinanced its existing $375 million credit agreement by entering into a Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"). The New Credit Agreement consists of a $240 million first lien term loan facility (the "First Lien Term Loan Facility"), a $120 million second lien term loan facility (the "Second Lien Term Loan Facility") and a $25 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). WilTel also used $90.0 million of its cash and investments to repay in full one of the outstanding notes that was secured by its headquarters building ($54.6 million including accrued interest), reduce the amount outstanding under its credit agreement ($15 million), reduce the amount outstanding under the other note that is secured by its headquarters building ($13.3 million) and pay expenses. The New Credit Agreement has not been guaranteed by Leucadia National Corporation and is not secured by any of the Company's assets other than the assets of WilTel. The First Lien Term Loan Facility requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $632,000 commencing December 31, 2004 through June 30, 2009, and quarterly principal payments of $57 million thereafter until final maturity on June 30, 2010. The Second Lien Term Loan Facility matures on December 31, 2010. However, if WilTel does not refinance its obligations under the remaining promissory note that is secured by its headquarters building ($60.4 million outstanding) prior to October 1, 2009, then the First Lien Term Loan Facility will mature on October 1, 2009, and if such promissory note is not refinanced by January 1, 2010, then the Second Lien Term Loan Facility will mature on January 1, 2010. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on September 24, 2009. The New Credit Agreement is subject to mandatory prepayment following the occurrence of certain events, including, with certain exceptions, with the proceeds of issuances of capital stock or incurrence of certain indebtedness by WilTel or its subsidiaries, sales of certain assets, Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) beginning in 2005 and in certain other circumstances. Loans under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based upon either the prime rate or LIBOR, at WilTel's option, plus a specified margin in each case. Currently, the rate on the First Lien Term Loan Facility is 7.25% and the rate on the Second Lien Term Loan Facility is 9.5%. These interest rates will be recalculated periodically based on changes in the LIBOR and prime rates. WilTel's obligations under its credit agreement are secured by substantially all of its assets other than those assets securing its headquarters building, for which the New Credit Agreement lenders have a second priority lien, and its aircraft capital lease. The New Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, creating liens or other encumbrances on their assets or revenues and certain other matters. The New Credit Agreement includes a Change of Control provision (as defined in the New 2
Credit Agreement), which is an event of default applicable to the First Lien Term Loan Facility and a triggering event for WilTel's obligation to offer to prepay the Second Lien Term Loan Facility. Copies of the New Credit Agreement and the related Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 9.01 and 9.02, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

The application of any prepayment of Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be made, first, to ABR Loans and, second, to Eurodollar Loans. Each prepayment of the Loans under this Section 2.12 (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans and Swingline Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid. The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each First Lien Facility Lender by facsimile or telephone (promptly confirmed by facsimile) notice of each prepayment of First Lien Facility Loans in whole or in part pursuant to Section 2.12(a), (b), (c) or (d) not less than five (5) Business Days' prior to the date such prepayment shall be made (each, a "Mandatory Prepayment Date"). Such notice shall set forth (i) the Mandatory Prepayment Date, (ii) the aggregate amount of such prepayment and (iii) the option of each First Lien Term Lender and New First Lien Term Lender to (x) decline to accept its share of such prepayment or (y) accept First Lien Declined Amounts. Any First Lien Term Lender or New First Lien Term Lender that wishes to exercise its option to decline such prepayment or to accept First Lien Declined Amounts shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by facsimile or telephone (promptly confirmed by facsimile) not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date. To the extent there are First Lien Declined Amounts that will not be accepted by the First Lien Facility Lenders, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Second Lien Facility Lender by facsimile or telephone (promptly confirmed by facsimile) notice of each prepayment of Second Lien Facility Loans in whole or in part pursuant to Section 2.12(a), (b), (c) or (d) not less than three (3) Business Days' prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date. Such notice shall set forth (i) the Mandatory Prepayment Date, (ii) the aggregate amount of such prepayment and (iii) the option of each Second Lien Facility Lender to (x) decline to accept its share of such prepayment or (y) accept Second Lien Declined Amounts. Any Second Lien Facility Lender that wishes to exercise its option to decline such prepayment or to accept Second Lien Declined Amounts shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by facsimile or telephone (promptly confirmed by facsimile) not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date. (f) If there shall exist any Borrowing Base Deficiency that remains uncured for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days following the delivery to the Administrative Agent of any Borrowing Base Certificate, the Borrower shall, without notice or demand by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, on such sixtieth (60th) day immediately first, prepay the Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans in accordance with Section 2.18(d) and second, prepay the First Lien Term Loans and New First Lien Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.18(b), in an aggregate amount equal to such Borrowing Base Deficiency. For purposes of this Section 2.12(f), a Borrowing Base Deficiency shall be deemed cured upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of a supplemental Borrowing Base Certificate of the Borrower containing the information prescribed by Exhibit G that is accurate as of a date not more than ten days prior to the date of delivery of such supplemental Borrowing Base Certificate, together with such supporting detail and documentation as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable credit judgment, evidencing the absence of any Borrowing Base Deficiency. (g) Immediately upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Borrower will give written notice (a "Control Change Notice") of such fact to the Administrative Agent, the Second Lien Lenders and the New Second Lien Lenders. The Control Change Notice shall (i) describe the facts and circumstances of such Change in Control in reasonable detail, (ii) make reference to this Section 2.12(g) and state that, unless such Lender makes a declaration of its intent not to have its Loans prepaid, or to have its Loans prepaid in part, as provided below, such Loans shall be prepaid in full, (iii) specify the date of prepayment, which shall be no earlier than five (5) Business Days nor later than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such 47
notice (the "Control Change Payment Date") and (iv) specify the date (the "Response Date") by which such Lender must respond to such Control Change Notice pursuant to this Section 2.12(g) in order not to have its Loans prepaid or to have its Loans partially prepaid (which shall not be earlier than five (5) Business Days after the date of delivery of the Control Change Notice). All Second Lien Facility Loans of such Lender shall be prepaid in full on the Control Change Payment Date unless on or prior to the Response Date such Lender delivers to the Borrower written notice (the "Response Notice") (i) not to prepay such Lender's Second Lien Facility Loans or (ii) to partially prepay such Lender's Second Facility Loans. The Borrower shall prepay in part on the Control Change Payment Date, in accordance with the applicable Response Notice, each Second Lien Facility Loan for which a Response Notice has been delivered specifying partial prepayment of such Second Lien Facility Loans. If on or prior to the Response Date a Lender provides a Response Notice declining prepayment of such Lender's Second Lien Facility Loans, the Second Lien Facility Loans of such Lender shall not be prepaid on the Control Change Payment Date. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no prepayments pursuant to Section 2.12(g) shall be made with respect to Second Lien Facility Loans until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations. (i) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments of Second Lien Facility Loans pursuant to Section 2.12(e) shall be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien Facility Loans in accordance with Section 2.18(c); provided that any Second Lien Lender or New Second Lien Lender may decline to accept any such prepayment (collectively, the "Second Lien Declined Amount"), in which case the Second Lien Declined Amount shall be used to pay, on a pro rata basis, the Second Lien Facility Loans held by Second Lien Facility Lenders that have elected to accept such Second Lien Declined Amounts. (j) If any mandatory prepayment of Second Lien Loans pursuant to Section 2.12(b) or (g) is made on or prior to the first anniversary of the Restatement Effective Date, the Borrower shall on the date of such prepayment, pay to the Lenders that hold (and accept prepayment for) such Loans a prepayment premium equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Loans so prepaid. 2.13 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date; provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor); provided that if the Borrower shall give notice of such conversion but fails to specify the length of the Interest Period to be applicable to the converted Loans, the Interest Period applicable to such Loans shall be one month; and provided, further, that no ABR Loan under a particular Facility may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. (b) Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance 48
with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans; provided that no Eurodollar Loan under a particular Facility may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations; and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall give notice of continuation but fails to specify the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, the Interest Period applicable to such Loans shall be one month; and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice of continuation as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the first proviso of this clause (b), such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 2.14 Amounts of Eurodollar Loans; Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans shall be in amounts equal to $2,000,000 or a whole multiple of $200,000 in excess thereof and (b) all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans shall be in such amounts and made pursuant to such elections so that, (i) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $2,000,000 or a whole multiple of $200,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no more than ten Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 2.15 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. (c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any (A) First Lien Facility Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or (B) Second Lien Facility Loan shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), all outstanding (A) First Lien Facility Loans and Reimbursement Obligations or (B) Second Lien Facility Loans, as applicable (in each case, whether or not overdue), shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of any of the Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility plus 2%, and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any (A) First Lien Facility Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or (B) Second Facility Loan, or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2% (or, in the case of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility, the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility plus 2%), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand. 2.16 Computation of Interest and Fees. 49
(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.15(a). 2.17 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans. 2.18 Pro rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder under the Revolving Facility, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to Revolving Percentages of the relevant Lenders. (b) Each prepayment by the Borrower on account of principal of the First Lien Term Loans and the New First Lien Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the applicable First Lien Term Lenders and New First Lien Term Lenders (provided that such pro rata requirement shall not apply with respect to 50
any First Lien Declined Amounts). The amount of each principal prepayment of the First Lien Term Loans and New First Lien Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the then remaining installments of the First Lien Term Loans and New First Lien Term Loans, as the case may be, in direct chronological order of maturity based upon the respective then remaining principal amounts thereof. Each scheduled payment by the Borrower on account of principal of or interest on First Lien Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the First Lien Term Loans then held by the First Lien Term Lenders. Each scheduled payment by the Borrower on account of principal of or interest on New First Lien Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the New First Lien Term Loans then held by the New First Lien Term Lenders. Amounts prepaid or repaid on account of any First Lien Term Loans or New First Lien Term Loans may not be reborrowed. (c) Each prepayment by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Second Lien Facility Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the applicable Second Lien Lenders and New Second Lien Lenders (provided that such pro rata requirement shall not apply with respect to any Second Lien Declined Amounts). Each scheduled payment by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on Second Lien Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of Second Lien Loans held by Second Lien Lenders. Each scheduled payment by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on New Second Lien Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of New Second Lien Loans held by New Second Lien Lenders. Amounts prepaid on account of any Second Lien Facility Loans may not be reborrowed. (d) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders. (e) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the 51
absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower. (g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 2.19 Requirements of Law. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof: (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.20 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding 52
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction. (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.20 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between any Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from any Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings or liabilities ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official 53
receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agents or any Lender as a result of any such failure. (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or (i) in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased and (ii) in the case of a Related Lender Assignment, to the assigning Lender thereunder) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY (or any subsequent version thereof or successors thereto), in each case, claiming exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If any Non-U.S. Lender is claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, such Non-U.S. Lender represents and warrants that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of Holdings and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Parent (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code), and such Non-U.S. Lender agrees that it shall provide the Administrative Agent with prompt written notice at any time after becoming a Lender hereunder in the event that at such time it could no longer make any of the foregoing representations and warranties. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender. (f) If any Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority but, in the case of penalties or other charges, only to the extent such penalties or other charges are indemnifiable hereunder) 54
to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (g) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.21 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.22 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.19 or 2.20(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20(a). 2.23 Defaulting Lenders; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Defaulting Lenders. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender, other than at the direction or request of any regulatory agency or authority, defaults (a "Defaulting Lender") in its obligation to fund (a "Funding Default") any Revolving Loan or its portion of any unreimbursed payment under Section 2.7(b) or Section 3.4 (in each case, a "Defaulted Loan"), then (i) during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Loan Documents; (ii) in the event of a failure of a Defaulting Lender to make payments owed hereunder to the Administrative Agent, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the 55
Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be required to make all voluntary or mandatory payments it would be required to make hereunder as if there was no Defaulting Lender, and the Administrative Agent may apply all amounts that otherwise would have been payable to the Defaulting Lender under the Loan Documents to the Administrative Agent, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, until the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, to the extent permitted by applicable law; (iii) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment and outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the Revolving Commitment fee payable to Revolving Lenders in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Revolving Commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.8 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender; and (iv) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender. No Revolving Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.23(a), performance by the Borrower of its obligations hereunder and the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of any Funding Default or the operation of this Section 2.23(a). The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.23(a) are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default and that the Administrative Agent, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default. (b) Replacement of Lenders. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20(a), (b) is a Defaulting Lender or otherwise defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder or (c) fails to consent to a requested waiver, amendment, supplement or other modification to any of the Loan Documents that, specifically or effectively, requires, to become effective, the consent of (i) each of the Lenders, (ii) each of the First Lien Facility Lenders, (iii) each Lender holding First Lien Term Loans or New First Lien Term Loans, (iv) each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders, (v) each Lender holding Second Lien Loans or New Second Lien Loans, (vi) each Lender holding Revolving Extensions of Credit or (vii) the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 15.1(b) or Section 15.1(c), in each such case, with a replacement financial or other commercial lending institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) in the case of clause (a), prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.22 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20(a), (iii) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (iv) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.21 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (v) the Borrower shall pay to such replaced Lender, in the case of a purchase of any Second Lien Loans on or prior to the first anniversary of the Restatement Effective Date, a premium equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of the Loans purchased from such replaced Lender by a replacement financial or other commercial lending institution, (vi) the replacement financial or other commercial lending institution, if not (x) already First Lien Facility Lender and purchasing First Lien Facility Loans or (y) already a Second Lien Facility Lender and purchasing Second Lien Facility Loans, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be deemed to have made such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any registration and processing fee required to be paid and referred to therein), (vii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20(a), as the case may be, (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, any Agent or any other Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall have against the replaced Lender and (x) in the case of clause (c) above, to the extent the consent of all Lenders or all First Lien Facility Lenders or all Second Lien Facility Lenders is required with respect to any Facility, the 56
Required Lenders, the Required First Lien Facility Lenders or the Required Second Lien Facility Lenders, as applicable, shall have consented to such waiver, amendment, supplement or other modification. Upon receipt by the replaced Lender of all amounts required to be paid to it pursuant to this Section 2.23(b), the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) and authorized to execute an Assignment and Assumption on behalf of such replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and Assumption so executed by the Administrative Agent, the replacement Lender and, to the extent required pursuant to Section 15.6, the Issuing Lender, shall be effective for purposes of this Section 2.23(b) and Section 15.6. Upon any such assignment, such replaced Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes hereof; provided that any rights of such replaced Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such replaced Lender. 2.24 Additional First Lien Term Facility. The Borrower may, during the period from and including the Restatement Effective Date to but excluding September 30, 2009, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, elect to request the establishment of New First Lien Term Loan commitments (each, a "New First Lien Term Commitment"), the proceeds of which shall be used solely to refinance outstanding Indebtedness under the OTC Long Term Note and pay related fees and expenses. Such notice shall specify (a) the date (the "First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date") on which the Borrower proposes that the New First Lien Term Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (b) the identity of each Lender or other Assignee (each, a "New First Lien Term Lender") to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of such New First Lien Term Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations; provided that (i) such New First Lien Term Commitments shall initially be offered to the First Lien Facility Lenders in proportion to their respective Aggregate First Lien Exposure Percentages and (ii) any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the New First Lien Term Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a New First Lien Term Commitment. Such New First Lien Term Commitments shall become effective as of such First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date; provided that (a) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such New First Lien Term Commitments; (b) both before and after giving effect to the making of the New First Lien Term Loans, each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 shall be satisfied; (c) the Loan Parties shall be in pro forma compliance with the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement (including Section 8.1 and Section 9.1, it being understood that for purposes thereof such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been consummated and incurred as of the first day of the immediately preceding four fiscal quarter period for which financial results are available and such Indebtedness shall be deemed outstanding for purposes of such pro forma compliance, and any Indebtedness repaid with New First Lien Term Loans shall be deemed to have been repaid as of the first day of such four quarter period) after giving effect to such New First Lien Term Commitments and New First Lien Term Loans, as certified by a Responsible Officer; (d) the New First Lien Term Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more joinder agreements (each, a "First Lien Term Loan Joinder Agreement") executed and delivered by Holdings, the Borrower, each other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and each New First Lien Term Lender (each of which shall be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 2.20(d)); and (e) the Borrower and the Loan Parties shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction and shall enter into such amendments to the Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order for the New First Lien Term Loans to be secured with respect to the Collateral on a basis similar to the First Lien Term Loans. Upon the effectiveness of the New First Lien Term Commitments on the First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each New First Lien Term Lender shall make a Loan to the Borrower (the "New First Lien Term Loans") in an amount equal to its New First Lien Term Commitment and (ii) each New First Lien Term Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New First Lien Term Commitment and the New First Lien Term Loans made pursuant thereto. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrower's notice of the First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date and in respect thereof the New First Lien Term Commitments and the New First Lien Term Lenders. The terms and provisions 57
of the New First Lien Term Loans and New First Lien Term Commitments shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein or in the First Lien Term Loan Joinder Agreement, identical to the First Lien Term Loans. In any event (i) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of all New First Lien Term Loans shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the First Lien Term Loans and (ii) the maturity date of the New First Lien Term Loans shall be no earlier than the First Lien Term Loan Maturity Date. In the event that the Net Yield for the New First Lien Term Loans is in excess of the per annum rate of interest applicable to the First Lien Term Loans, then the per annum rate of interest for all outstanding First Lien Term Loans shall automatically be increased to the extent required so that the per annum rate of interest for all outstanding First Lien Term Loans is equal to the Net Yield for the New First Lien Term Loans without any action or consent of Holdings, the Borrower, any other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender. "Net Yield", for purposes of New First Lien Term Loans, shall mean the sum of (a) the Applicable Margin applicable to such New First Lien Term Loans at the First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date plus (b) any original issue discount offered to New First Lien Term Lenders amortized equally over the period from the First Lien Term Loan Increased Amount Date to the applicable maturity date of the New First Lien Term Loans; provided that such original issue discount shall not be amortized over a period of greater than four years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Holdings, the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, and the Administrative Agent may execute such amendments and/or amendments and restatements to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.24, and each First Lien Term Loan Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect any such amendments and/or amendments and restatements to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.24. 2.25 Additional Second Lien Facility.

Such notice shall specify (a) the date (the "Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date") on which the Borrower proposes that the New Second Lien Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (b) the identity of each Lender or other Assignee (each, a "New Second Lien Lender") to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of such New Second Lien Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations; provided (i) such New Second Lien Commitments shall initially be offered to the Second Lien Facility Lenders in proportion to their respective Aggregate Second Lien Exposure Percentages and (ii) that any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the New Second Lien Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a New Second Lien Commitment. Such New Second Lien Commitments shall become effective as of such Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date; provided that (a) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such New Second Lien Commitments; (b) both before and after giving effect to the making of the New Second Lien Loans, each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 shall be satisfied; (c) the Loan Parties shall be in pro forma compliance with the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement (including Section 8.1 and Section 9.1, it being understood that for purposes thereof such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been consummated and incurred as of the first day of the immediately preceding four fiscal quarter period for which financial results are available and such Indebtedness shall be deemed outstanding for purposes of such pro forma compliance, and any Indebtedness repaid with New Second Lien Loans shall be deemed to have been repaid as of the first day of such four quarter period) after giving effect to such New Second Lien Commitments and New Second Lien Loans, as certified by a Responsible Officer; (d) the New Second Lien Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one 58
or more joinder agreements (each, a "Second Lien Loan Joinder Agreement") executed and delivered by Holdings, the Borrower, each other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and each New Second Lien Lender (each of which shall be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 2.20(d)); and (e) the Borrower and the Loan Parties shall deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction and shall enter into such amendments to the Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order for the New Second Lien Loans to be secured with respect to the Collateral on a basis similar to the Second Lien Loans. Upon the effectiveness of the New Second Lien Commitments on the Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each New Second Lien Lender shall make a Loan to the Borrower (the "New Second Lien Loans") in an amount equal to its New Second Lien Commitment and (ii) each New Second Lien Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New Second Lien Commitment and the New Second Lien Loans made pursuant thereto. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrower's notice of the Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date and in respect thereof the New Second Lien Commitments and the New Second Lien Lenders.

In any event (i) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of all New Second Lien Loans shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Second Lien Loans and (ii) the maturity date of the New Second Lien Loans shall be no earlier than the Second Lien Loan Maturity Date. In the event that the Net Yield for the New Second Lien Loans is in excess of the per annum rate of interest applicable to the Second Lien Loans, then the per annum rate of interest for all outstanding Second Lien Loans shall automatically be increased to any extent required so that the per annum rate of interest for all outstanding Second Lien Loans is equal to the Net Yield for the New Second Lien Loans without any action or consent of Holdings, the Borrower, any other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender. "Net Yield", for purposes of New Second Lien Loans, shall mean the sum of (a) the Applicable Margin applicable to such New Second Lien Loans at the Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date plus (b) any original issue discount offered to New Second Lien Lenders amortized equally over the period from the Second Lien Loan Increased Amount Date to the applicable maturity date of the New Second Lien Loans; provided that such original issue discount shall not be amortized over a period of greater than four years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Holdings, the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, and the Administrative Agent may execute such amendments and/or amendments and restatements to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.25, and each Second Lien Loan Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect any such amendments and/or amendments and restatements to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.25. 2.26 Determination of Borrowing Base. (a) Eligible Accounts. On any date of determination of the Borrowing Base, all of the Accounts owned by each Borrowing Base Party and reflected in the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered by the Borrower to the First Lien Administrative Agent shall be "Eligible Accounts" for the purposes of this Agreement, except any Account to which any of the exclusionary criteria set forth below applies. In addition, the First Lien Administrative Agent reserves the right, at any time and from time to time after the Restatement Effective Date, to adjust any of the criteria set forth below, to establish new criteria and to adjust the percentage of Eligible Accounts included in the Borrowing Base, in its reasonable credit judgment, subject to the approval of the Required First Lien Lenders in the case of adjustments, new criteria or changes in the percentage of Eligible Accounts included in the Borrowing Base which have the effect of increasing the Borrowing Base from that which would have been applicable if the standards in effect on the Restatement 59
Effective Date had continued to be in effect. Eligible Accounts shall not include any of the following Accounts: (i) any Account on which the First Lien Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the First Lien Lenders, does not have a first priority and exclusive (except with respect to any second priority Liens securing the Second Lien Obligations) perfected Lien; (ii) any Account due from an Account Debtor that is not domiciled in the United States or Canada and (if not a natural person) organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or the laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof unless such Account is fully backed by an irrevocable letter of credit issued on terms and by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to the First Lien Administrative Agent; (iii) any Account that is payable in any currency other than Dollars; (iv) any Account that does not arise from the sale, lease, license, assignment or other disposition of goods or services rendered by such Borrowing Base Party in the ordinary course of its business; (v) any Account that does not comply with all applicable legal requirements, including all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority (including any Account due from an Account Debtor located in any State, unless the applicable Borrowing Base Party (at the time the Account was created and at all times thereafter) (i) had filed and has maintained effective a current notice of business activities report with the appropriate office or agency of such State, as applicable, or (ii) was and has continued to be exempt from filing such report); (vi) any Account that is not a true and correct statement of bona fide indebtedness or obligations incurred in the amount of the Account for the sale, lease, license, assignment or other disposition of goods or services rendered and accepted by the applicable Account Debtor; (vii) any Account that arises from a sale to, or services rendered to, any Group Member or any director, officer or other employee of any Group Member; (viii) any Account that is in default; provided that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Account shall be deemed in default if it is more than 90 days past due according to its original terms; (ix) any Account that is the obligation of an Account Debtor if 50% or more of the dollar amount of all Accounts owing by that Account Debtor are ineligible under the other criteria set forth in this Section 2.26(a); (x) any Account as to which any of the representations or warranties in the Loan Documents is untrue; (xi) to the extent such Account is evidenced by a judgment, Instrument or Chattel Paper; 60

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit ("Letters of Credit") for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date; provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods of up to one-year (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above). 61
(b) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law. 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application (a) the Administrative Agent shall inform the Issuing Lender of the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans then outstanding and (b) the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof). 3.3 Fees and Other Charges. (a) The Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans under the Revolving Facility, shared ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit. 3.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage in the Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any 62
other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it. 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower.

Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 2.15(b) and (y) thereafter, Section 2.15(c). 3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter 63
of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower. 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 3.8 Applications.

In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree: (i) to cooperate in good faith in order to determine, upon any request by the First Lien Administrative Agent or the Second Lien Administrative Agent, the specific assets included in the First Lien Collateral and the Second Lien Collateral, the steps taken to perfect the First Priority Liens and the Second Priority Liens thereon and the identity of the parties obligated under the Loan Documents; (ii) that the documents, agreements and instruments creating or evidencing the First Lien Collateral and the First Priority Liens shall be the same documents, agreements and instruments as (or shall be in all material respects the same form as) the documents, agreements and instruments creating or evidencing the Second Lien Collateral and the Second Priority Liens, and, except with respect to Mortgages executed prior to the Restatement Effective Date, shall set forth therein the first priority and second priority nature of the Liens created or evidenced thereunder; and (iii) to the extent that, notwithstanding this Section 14.1(e), the First Lien Collateral and the Second Lien Collateral are not identical, each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that any amounts received by or distributed to any of the Second Lien Secured Parties pursuant to or as a result of Second Priority Liens on assets that are not subject to the First Priority Lien shall be subject to Section 14.4(b). 14.2 Enforcement of Rights; Matters Relating to Collateral. (a) Exercise of Rights and Remedies. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced, the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights and exercise remedies (including any right of setoff) with respect to the Collateral (including making determinations regarding the release (subject to the terms of Section 14.3(c)), Disposition or restrictions with respect to the Collateral), or to commence or seek to commence any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any foreclosure action or proceeding or any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), in each case, without any consultation with or the consent of the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the Second Lien Administrative Agent may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Second Lien Obligations; (ii) the Second Lien Administrative Agent may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Second Priority Liens (provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the First Priority Liens or the rights of the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Section 14, including the automatic release of Second Priority Liens provided in Section 14.3(c)); (iii) the Second Lien Secured Parties may file any necessary responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims of the Second Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, or otherwise make any agreements or file any motions pertaining to the Second Lien Obligations, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Section 14; (iv) the Second Lien Secured Parties may exercise rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as provided in Section 14.3(b); and (v) subject to Section 14.3(a), the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second 123
Lien Secured Parties may enforce any of their rights and exercise any of their remedies with respect to the Collateral after the termination of the Standstill Period (the actions described in this proviso being referred to herein as the "Second Lien Permitted Actions"). Except for the Second Lien Permitted Actions, unless and until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred, the sole right of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral shall be to receive a share of the proceeds of the Collateral, if any, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred and in accordance with the Loan Documents and applicable law. (b) In exercising rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Loan Documents related to or securing the First Lien Facilities and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to Dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with any such Disposition and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code, the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law. The First Lien Administrative Agent agrees to provide at least five days' prior written notice to the Second Lien Administrative Agent of its intention to foreclose upon or Dispose of any Collateral. (c) Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), hereby acknowledges and agrees that no covenant, agreement or restriction contained in any Security Document or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights and remedies of the First Lien Administrative Agent or the other First Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral as set forth in this Section 14 (including, without limitation, and subject to the provisions of Section 14.3(c)) and the other Loan Documents. 14.3 No Interference. (a) Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that, whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced, the Second Lien Secured Parties: (i) will not, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, (A) enforce or exercise, or seek to enforce or exercise, any rights or remedies (including any right of setoff) with respect to any Collateral (including the enforcement of any right under any lockbox agreement, account control agreement, landlord waiver or bailee's letter or any similar agreement or arrangement to which the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party is a party) or (B) commence or join with any person (other than the Administrative Agent and the First Lien Administrative Agent) in commencing, or petition for or vote in favor of any resolution for, any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any foreclosure action or proceeding or any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding); provided that the Second Lien Administrative Agent may enforce or exercise any or all such rights and remedies, or commence or petition for any such action or proceeding, after a period of 180 days has elapsed since the date on which the Second Lien Administrative Agent has delivered to the First Lien Administrative Agent written notice of the existence of a Second Lien Event of Default, so long as such Second Lien Event of Default has not been cured or waived and is continuing since the date of such notice (the "Standstill Period"); provided, further, that (I) notwithstanding the expiration of the Standstill Period or anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured 124
Party enforce or exercise any rights or remedies with respect to any Collateral, or commence or petition for any such action or proceeding, if the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is diligently pursuing in good faith the enforcement or exercise of their rights or remedies with respect to a material portion of the Collateral or any such action or proceeding (prompt written notice thereof to be given to the Second Lien Administrative Agent) and (II) in the event that the Second Lien Secured Parties (or the Second Lien Administrative Agent on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Parties) have commenced any actions to enforce the Second Lien Administrative Agent's Lien on any Collateral to the extent permitted hereunder and are diligently pursuing such actions, neither the First Lien Administrative Agent nor any First Lien Secured Party shall take any action of a similar nature with respect to such Collateral; (ii) will not contest, protest or object to any foreclosure action or proceeding brought by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party, or any other enforcement or exercise by any First Lien Secured Party of any rights or remedies relating to the Collateral under the Loan Documents or otherwise, so long as Second Priority Liens attach to the proceeds thereof subject to the relative priorities set forth in Section 14.1(a); (iii) subject to the Second Lien Secured Parties' rights under clause (i) above, will not object to the forbearance by the First Lien Administrative Agent or the other First Lien Secured Parties from commencing or pursuing any foreclosure action or proceeding or any other enforcement or exercise of any rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral; (iv) will not, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred and except for Second Lien Permitted Actions, take or receive any Collateral, or any proceeds thereof or payment with respect thereto, in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including any right of setoff) with respect to any Collateral or in connection with any insurance policy award or any condemnation award (or deed in lieu of condemnation); (v) will not, except for Second Lien Permitted Actions, take any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, hinder, in any manner, any exercise of remedies of any First Lien Secured Party under the Loan Documents, including any Disposition of any Collateral, whether by foreclosure or otherwise; (vi) will not, except for Second Lien Permitted Actions, object to the manner in which the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may seek to enforce or collect the First Lien Obligations or the First Priority Liens, regardless of whether any action or failure to act by or on behalf of the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is, or could be, adverse to the interests of the Second Lien Secured Parties, and will not assert, and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to demand, request, plead or otherwise assert or claim the benefit of any marshalling or, provided the First Lien Administrative Agent or such other First Lien Secured Party conducts such enforcement or collection actions in a commercially reasonable manner, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the Collateral or any similar rights a junior secured creditor may have under applicable law; and 125
(vii) will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial proceeding or otherwise, to challenge or question the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligation or any provisions of any Loan Document (other than provisions related solely to the Second Lien Facilities), or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or obligations established by this Section 14. (b) Rights as Unsecured Creditors. The Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties may, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and applicable law, exercise against the Borrower and any Guarantor rights and remedies as unsecured creditors. Nothing in this Section 14 shall prohibit the receipt by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party of the required payments of principal, premium, interest, fees and other amounts due under and in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents so long as such receipt is not the direct or indirect result of the enforcement or exercise by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party of rights or remedies as a secured creditor (including any right of setoff) or enforcement in contravention of this Section 14 of any Second Priority Lien. (c) Automatic Release of Second Priority Liens. If, in connection with (i) any Disposition of any Collateral (other than as provided in clause (ii)) permitted under the terms of the Loan Documents the First Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other First Lien Secured Parties) releases any of the First Priority Liens, other than any such release granted (A) in connection with the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Second Lien Event of Default, or (ii) the enforcement or exercise of any rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral during the existence of any First Lien Event of Default, including any Dispositions of the Collateral, the First Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other First Lien Secured Parties) releases any of the First Priority Liens, other than any such release granted (A) in connection with the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or (B) in connection with the foreclosure, sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Collateral, then, in each such case, the Second Priority Liens on such Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released, and the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall, for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties, promptly execute and deliver to the First Lien Administrative Agent or the relevant Loan Party such termination statements, releases and other documents as the First Lien Administrative Agent or such Loan Party may reasonably request to effectively confirm such release; provided that, in the case of a Disposition of Collateral (other than any such Disposition in connection with the enforcement or exercise of any rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral), the Second Priority Liens shall not be so released if such Disposition is not otherwise permitted under Section 9.5; and provided, further, that if the Aggregate First Lien Exposure of all First Lien Facility Lenders shall be less than 30% of the sum of (I) the Aggregate First Lien Exposure of all First Lien Facility Lenders plus (II) the Aggregate Second Lien Exposure of all Second Lien Facility Lenders, any release of Second Priority Liens pursuant to clause (ii) above shall require the consent of Lenders representing in the aggregate more than 50% of the sum of (x) the Aggregate First Lien Exposure of all First Lien Facility Lenders plus (y) the Aggregate Second Lien Exposure of all Second Lien Facility Lenders. Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations occurs, each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of each other Second Lien Secured Party), hereby appoints the First Lien Administrative Agent, and any officer or agent of the First Lien Administrative Agent, with full power of substitution, as the attorney-in-fact of each Second Lien Secured Party for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 14.3(c) and taking any action and executing any instrument that the First Lien Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Section 14.3(c) (including any endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release), which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest; provided that unless the First Lien Secured Parties reasonably believe that they would be materially and adversely affected as a result thereof, the First Lien Administrative Agent will not be entitled to exercise such power of attorney to execute and deliver a release or other 126
document or instrument of transfer unless the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall have been requested to execute and deliver such release or other document or instrument of transfer and shall not have done so within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of such request. This Section 14.3(c) shall also be applicable in connection with actions taken by the Administrative Agent with respect to Collateral held by it for the benefit of all Secured Parties, and shall permit the Administrative Agent to release Liens on such Collateral to the same extent as the Second Priority Liens on such Collateral would otherwise be required to be released by the Second Lien Administrative Agent if such Liens were granted directly to the Second Lien Administrative Agent. (d) Insurance and Condemnation Awards. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a First Lien Event of Default, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right, subject to the rights of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, to settle and adjust claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding, or any deed in lieu of condemnation, in respect of the Collateral. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a First Lien Event of Default, all proceeds of any such policy and any such award, or any payments with respect to a deed in lieu of condemnation, shall (i) first, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and subject to the rights of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, be paid to the First Lien Administrative Agent for the benefit of First Lien Secured Parties pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, (b) second, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and subject to the rights of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, be paid to the Second Lien Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Second Lien Secured Parties pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, and (c) third, if no Second Lien Obligations are outstanding, be paid to the owner of the subject property, such other Person as may be entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party shall, at any time, receive any proceeds of any such insurance policy or any such award or payment, it shall transfer and pay over such proceeds to the First Lien Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 14.4(b). 14.4 Payments. (a) Application of Proceeds. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by the First Lien Administrative Agent in connection with any Disposition of, or collection on, such Collateral upon the enforcement or exercise of any right or remedy (including any right of setoff) shall be applied by the First Lien Administrative Agent to the First Lien Obligations in such order as is specified in Section 7.5 of the Security Agreement. Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Second Lien Administrative Agent any remaining Collateral and any proceeds thereof then held by it in the same form as received, together with any necessary endorsements, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct, to be applied by the Second Lien Administrative Agent to the Second Lien Obligations in such order as is specified in the Security Agreement. The provisions of this Section 14.4(a) shall equally apply to any Collateral or such proceeds held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of all Lenders, which shall be applied to the First Lien Obligations in such order as is specified in the Security Agreement, until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, and thereafter, to the Second Lien Obligations as specified in Section 8.5 of the Security Agreement. (b) Payment Over. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, any Collateral, or any proceeds thereof or payment with respect thereto (together with assets or proceeds subject to Liens referred to in the final sentence of Section 14.1(c)), received by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including any right of setoff) with respect to the Collateral, or in connection with any insurance policy claim or any 127
condemnation award (or deed in lieu of condemnation), in contravention of this Section 14 shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith transferred or paid over to the First Lien Administrative Agent for the benefit of the First Lien Secured Parties in the same form as received, together with any necessary endorsements, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations occurs, each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of each other Second Lien Secured Party), hereby appoints the First Lien Administrative Agent, and any officer or agent of the First Lien Administrative Agent, with full power of substitution, the attorney-in-fact of each Second Lien Secured Party for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 14.4(b) and taking any action and executing any instrument that the First Lien Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Section 14.4(b), which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. 14.5 Bailment and Sub-Agency for Perfection of Certain Security Interests. (a) Each of the First Lien Facility Lenders and the First Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of each other First Lien Secured Party) agrees that if the First Lien Administrative Agent shall at any time hold a First Priority Lien on any Collateral that can be perfected by the possession or control of such Collateral or of any account in which such Collateral is held, and if such Collateral or any such account is in fact in the possession or under the control of the First Lien Administrative Agent, or of agents or bailees of the First Lien Administrative Agent (such Collateral being referred to herein as the "Pledged or Controlled Collateral"), the First Lien Administrative Agent shall, solely for the purpose of perfecting the Second Priority Liens granted under the Loan Documents and subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 14.5, also hold such Pledged or Controlled Collateral as bailee for the Second Lien Administrative Agent, to the extent the Second Lien Administrative Agent does not otherwise have possession or control thereof. (b) So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, the First Lien Administrative Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Pledged or Controlled Collateral in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Section 14 and the other First Lien Loan Documents as if the Second Priority Liens did not exist. The obligations and responsibilities of the First Lien Administrative Agent to the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties under this Section 14.5 shall be limited solely to holding or controlling the Pledged or Controlled Collateral as bailee in accordance with this Section 14.5. Without limiting the foregoing, the First Lien Administrative Agent shall have no obligation or responsibility to ensure that any Pledged or Controlled Collateral is genuine or owned by any of the Loan Parties. The First Lien Administrative Agent acting pursuant to this Section 14.5 shall not, by reason of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other document, have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any other First Lien Secured Party, the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party. (c) Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Administrative Agent shall transfer the possession and control of the Pledged or Controlled Collateral, together with any necessary endorsements but without recourse or warranty, (i) if the Second Lien Obligations are outstanding at such time, to the Second Lien Administrative Agent, and (ii) if no Second Lien Obligations are outstanding at such time, to the Borrower, in each case so as to allow such person to obtain possession and control of such Pledged or Controlled Collateral. In connection with any transfer under clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence, the First Lien Administrative Agent agrees to take all actions in its power as shall be reasonably requested by the Second Lien Administrative Agent to permit the Second Lien Administrative Agent to obtain, for the benefit of the Second Lien Secured Parties, a first priority, perfected security interest in the Pledged or Controlled Collateral. 128
14.6 Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. (a) Finance and Sale Matters. (i) Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred, each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that, in the event of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the Second Lien Secured Parties: (A) will not oppose or object to the use of any Collateral constituting cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, unless the First Lien Secured Parties, or a representative authorized by the First Lien Secured Parties, shall oppose or object to such use of cash collateral; (B) will not oppose or object to any post-petition financing provided by any First Lien Secured Party or any Affiliate of any First Lien Secured Party, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other Bankruptcy Law (a "DIP Financing"), unless (I) the First Lien Secured Parties, or a representative authorized by the First Lien Secured Parties, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or (II) the aggregate principal amount of loans and letter of credit accommodations outstanding under such DIP Financing, together with the aggregate principal amount of the pre-petition First Lien Obligations, exceeds the Maximum First Lien Obligations Amount; and (C) except to the extent permitted by subparagraph (ii) of this Section 14.6(a), in connection with the use of cash collateral as described in clause (A) above or a DIP Financing, will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing. (ii) Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that no Second Lien Secured Party shall contest, or support any other Person in contesting, (A) any request by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party for adequate protection or (B) any objection, based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection, by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if, in connection with any DIP Financing, any First Lien Secured Party is granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral or a replacement lien or superpriority claims, then the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), may seek or accept adequate protection consisting solely of (A) replacement liens or additional collateral, which Liens will be subordinated to the First Priority Liens and the Liens securing the DIP Financing and all obligations related thereto ("DIP Financing Liens") on the same basis as the other Second Priority Liens are subordinated to the First Priority Liens under this Section 14 and (B) superpriority claims junior in all respects to the superpriority claims granted to the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party. In addition to the foregoing, if the First Lien Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection which provides for the current payment in full of interest on the First Lien Facility Loans and payment of the First Lien Secured Parties' fees and expenses, then in connection with any such 129
DIP Financing, the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties) may seek or accept adequate protection in connection with any such DIP Financing which provides solely for the payment of interest on the Second Lien Facility Loans and the payment of the Second Lien Secured Parties' fees and expenses. (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Second Lien Secured Parties may object to any DIP Financing that purports to govern or control the provisions or content of a plan of reorganization of any Loan Party, other than providing for satisfaction in full in cash of the DIP Financing on or prior to the effective date of such plan of reorganization and (B) nothing herein shall prohibit the Second Lien Secured Parties from proposing any alternative DIP Financing to any Loan Party or the relevant bankruptcy court. (b) Relief from the Automatic Stay. Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, no Second Lien Secured Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Required First Lien Facility Lenders, seek or request relief from or modification of the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding in respect of any part of the Collateral, any proceeds thereof or any Second Priority Lien. (c) Reorganization Securities. If, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, on account of both the First Lien Obligations and the Second Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the First Lien Obligations and on account of the Second Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same assets or property, the provisions of this Section 14 will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations. (d) Post-Petition Interest. (i) Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders and the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), agrees that no Second Lien Secured Party shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of First Lien Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or expenses to the extent of the value of the First Priority Liens (it being understood and agreed that such value shall be determined without regard to the existence of the Second Priority Liens on the Collateral or the Second Lien Obligations). (ii) Each of the First Lien Facility Lenders and the First Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other First Lien Secured Parties), agrees that no First Lien Secured Party shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of Second Lien Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or expenses to the extent of the value of the Second Priority Liens (it being understood and agreed that such value shall be determined taking into account the First Priority Liens on the Collateral). 130
(e) Separate Classes. Each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other Second Lien Secured Parties), the First Lien Facility Lenders, the First Lien Administrative Agent (for itself and on behalf of the other First Lien Secured Parties), the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, Holdings and the other Loan Parties irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that (i) the claims and interests of the First Lien Secured Parties and the Second Lien Secured Parties are not "substantially similar" within the meaning of Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, (ii) the grants of the First Priority Liens and the grants of the Second Priority Liens constitute two separate and distinct grants of Liens (other than Liens granted in respect of the existing Mortgages for which Mortgage Amendments shall not be delivered in accordance with Section 5.1(o)(i) or Section 6.11), (iii) the First Lien Secured Parties rights in the Collateral are fundamentally different from the Second Lien Secured Parties' rights in the Collateral and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, among other things, the First Lien Obligations and the Second Lien Obligations must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or adopted in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. Each of the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the First Lien Secured Parties, the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the Second Lien Secured Parties further irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that the First Lien Secured Parties and the Second Lien Secured Parties shall in all respects be deemed to be, and shall vote as, separate classes of creditors in connection with any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, including, without limitation, for purposes of determining the allowance of any claim by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party for First Lien Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or expenses and with respect to voting on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan with respect to any Loan Party. 14.7 Other Agreements. (a) Matters Relating to Loan Documents. (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 15.1, the provisions of the Loan Documents related to the First Lien Facilities may be amended, restated supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms, and new Loan Documents related to the First Lien Facilities may be entered into (any of the foregoing, a "First Lien Loan Documents Modification" and such amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified First Lien Facilities, "Modified First Lien Facilities"), and the Indebtedness under the First Lien Facilities may be Refinanced (such Refinanced First Lien Facilities, "Refinanced First Lien Facilities"), in each case, without the consent of any Second Lien Secured Party (except as required under Section 15.1); provided that no such First Lien Loan Documents Modification or Refinancing shall (A) result in the sum of (I) the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under such Modified First Lien Facilities or Refinanced First Lien Facilities, plus (II) the unused portion of the revolving commitments under such Modified First Lien Facilities or Refinanced First Lien Facilities, plus (III) the aggregate face amount of all letters of credit issued or deemed issued and outstanding under such Modified First Lien Facilities or Refinanced First Lien Facilities, plus (IV) the aggregate amount of any new term loan commitments that may be established at the request of the Borrower under the Modified First Lien Facilities or Refinanced First Lien Facilities (in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (I), (II), (III) and (IV), as determined after giving effect to such First Lien Loan Documents Modification or Refinancing) exceeding the sum of (v) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding First Lien Facility Loans, plus (w) the unused portion of the Revolving Commitments, plus (x) the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit issued or deemed issued and outstanding, plus (y) if the OTC Long Term Note is then outstanding, the amount of First Lien Facility Loans permitted under Section 9.2(g) (for the purposes set forth therein) (in the case of each the foregoing 131

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an "Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it and the Note or Notes (if any) held by it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for (1) an assignment of all or any portion of a First Lien Term Loan or a New First Lien Term Loan to a First Lien Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a First Lien Facility Lender or a First Lien Approved Fund, (2) an assignment of all or any portion of a Second Lien Facility Loan to a Second Lien Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a Second Lien Facility Lender or a Second Lien Approved Fund, (3) an assignment of a Revolving Commitment to a First Lien Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a First Lien Facility Lender or a First Lien Approved Fund, (4) an assignment of all or any portion of a Loan or Commitments by CSFB to any Person or (5) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, an assignment of all or any portion of a Loan or Commitments 144
to any other Person; provided that, in each case, with respect to the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), such Assignee is not a Competitor at the time of assignment; (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for (1) an assignment of all or any portion of a First Lien Term Loan or a New First Lien Term Loan to a First Lien Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a First Lien Facility Lender or a First Lien Approved Fund or (2) an assignment of all or any portion of a Second Lien Facility Loan to a Second Lien Facility Lender, an Affiliate of a Second Lien Facility Lender or a Second Lien Approved Fund; and (C) with respect to any proposed assignment of all or a portion of any Revolving Commitment, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender. (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents; provided that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any; (B) the parties to each assignment shall (1) electronically execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which initially shall be ClearPar, LLC) or (2) manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that only one such fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Approved Funds); and (C) except in the case of a Related Lender Assignment, the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 15.6 to the contrary, a Lender may effect a Related Lender Assignment without delivering an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent and without payment of the processing and recordation fee (provided that, subject to Section 15.6(b)(ii)(B), such fee shall be payable if a Related Lender Assignment is disclosed by the delivery of a manually executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent) and without delivering an administrative questionnaire (provided that should an Assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment that is not a Lender deliver an Assignment and Assumption Agreement for recording, such Assignee shall deliver an administrative questionnaire); provided that the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to 145
deal solely and directly with such assigning Lender until such Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been delivered to the Administrative Agent and promptly recorded in the Register in accordance with Section 15.6(b)(iv). The failure of such assigning Lender to deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to such Related Lender Assignment shall not affect the legality, validity or binding effect of such assignment, which shall be effective upon the execution of such Related Lender Assignment by the parties thereto. Each assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment shall be deemed to have consented to be bound by the terms of Section 14. Subject to the provisions set forth in the following sentence, the Borrower agrees that each assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 to the same extent as if it had consummated such assignment by delivery of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 15.7(c), provided that as a Lender such assignee shall be subject to Section 15.7(a) and Section 15.7(b). An assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable assignor Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the Loans assigned in such Related Lender Assignment until an Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been delivered to the Administrative Agent and promptly recorded in the Register in accordance with Section 15.6(b)(iv). Any assignee party to a Related Lender Assignment shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20(a) unless such assignee complies with Section 2.20(d). (iii) Except in the case of Related Lender Assignments, subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20, 2.21 and 15.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 15.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. In the case of Related Lender Assignments (and notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence), the failure of the assigning Lender to deliver an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to any such Related Lender Assignment to the Administrative Agent shall not affect the legality, validity or binding effect of such assignment, which shall be effective upon the execution of such Related Lender Assignment by the parties thereto; provided that the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such assigning Lender until such Assignment and Assumption Assignment has been delivered to the Administrative Agent and promptly recorded in the Register in accordance with Section 15.6(b)(iv) below. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations (a "Registered Loan") owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may 146
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In the case of a Related Lender Assignment that is not reflected in the Register, the assigning Lender, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a comparable register. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed administrative questionnaire and any forms required under Section 2.20(d) (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section (in each case to the extent required), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (except to the extent provided herein with respect to Related Lender Assignments). (c) (i) Any Lender may sell participations to one or more banks, financial institutions or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that participations may not be sold to any Person that is a Competitor at the time of such sale; and provided, further, that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 15.1(b) or (c) and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 15.7(c) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant shall be subject to Section 15.7(a) and Section 15.7(b) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20(a) unless such Participant complies with Section 2.20(d). (iii) In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Registered Loan, such Lender shall maintain a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it (the "Participant Register"). A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in 147
whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. (d) Without the consent of or notice to any Agent or any Loan Party, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 15.6(b). Each of Holdings, the Borrower and each other Loan Party, each Lender and each Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance. 15.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 14, and except to the extent that this Agreement otherwise expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any First Lien Facility Lender (a "Benefited First Lien Facility Lender") shall receive any payment of all or part of the First Lien Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10(f) or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other First Lien Facility Lender, if any, in respect of the First Lien Obligations owing to such other First Lien Facility Lender, such Benefited First Lien Facility Lender shall purchase for cash from the other First Lien Facility Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the First Lien Obligations owing to each such other First Lien Facility Lender, or shall provide such other First Lien Facility Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited First Lien Facility Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the First Lien Facility Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited First Lien Facility Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 14, and except to the extent that this Agreement otherwise expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Second Lien Facility Lender (a "Benefited Second Lien Facility Lender") shall receive any payment of all or part of the Second Lien Obligations owing to 148
it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10(f) or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Second Lien Facility Lender, if any, in respect of the Second Lien Obligations owing to such other Second Lien Facility Lender, such Benefited Second Lien Facility Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Second Lien Facility Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Second Lien Obligations owing to each such other Second Lien Facility Lender, or shall provide such other Second Lien Facility Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Second Lien Facility Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Second Lien Facility Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Second Lien Facility Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 14, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender and any Affiliate thereof shall have the right, without prior notice to Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being expressly waived by Holdings, the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or Affiliate thereof or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of Holdings, the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 15.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 15.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 15.10 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of Holdings, the Borrower and the other Loan Parties, the Agents and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. 15.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 149

(i) all Instruments; (j) all Intellectual Property; (k) all Inventory; (l) all Investment Property; (m) all Letter-of-Credit Rights; (n) all other property not otherwise described above; (o) all books and records pertaining to the Second Lien Collateral; and (p) to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds, Supporting Obligations and products of any and all of the foregoing and all collateral security and guarantees given by any Person with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that notwithstanding any of the other provisions set forth in this Section 3, this Agreement shall not constitute a grant of a security interest in (a) any Excluded Capital Stock (to the extent the pledge thereof would require "nonbank lenders" to file a "Form FRG-1" or a "Form FRG-4" (as such quoted terms are used in Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect)) or (b) any property to the extent that such grant of a security interest is prohibited by any Requirement of Law of a Governmental Authority, requires a consent not obtained of any Governmental Authority pursuant to such Requirement of Law or is prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of or requires any consent not obtained under, any contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or giving rise to such property, except (i) to the extent that the terms in such contract, license, instrument or other document providing for such prohibition, breach, default or termination, or requiring such consent are not permitted under Section 8.14 of the Credit Agreement or (ii) to the extent that such Requirement of Law or the term in such contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document providing for such prohibition, breach, default or termination or requiring such consent is ineffective under Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code) or principles of equity; provided, however, that such security interest shall attach immediately at such time as such Requirement of Law is not effective or applicable, or any such consent is obtained, or such prohibition, breach, default or termination is no longer applicable or is waived, and to the extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of the Second Lien Collateral that does not result in such consequences; and provided, further, that no United States intent-to-use trademark or service mark application shall be included in the Second Lien Collateral to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark or service mark application under Federal law. After such period, each Grantor acknowledges that such interest in such trademark or service mark application shall be subject to a security interest in favor of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and shall be included in the Second Lien Collateral. Section 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce each Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions of credit to the Borrower thereunder, each Grantor hereby represents and warrants to each Agent and each other Secured Party that: 7

For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any Grantor may, as part of its business, grant licenses to third parties to use Intellectual Property owned or developed by a Grantor. For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such licensing activity shall not constitute a "Lien" on such Intellectual Property. Each Agent and each other Secured Party understands that any such licenses may be exclusive to the applicable licensees, and such exclusivity provisions may limit the ability of any Agent to utilize, sell, lease or transfer the related Intellectual Property or otherwise realize value from such Intellectual Property pursuant hereto. 4.2 Perfected Liens.

(b) All the shares of the Pledged Stock of each Subsidiary of such Grantor have been duly and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. (c) Such Grantor is the record and beneficial owner of, and has title to, the Pledged Stock and Pledged Notes pledged by it hereunder, free of any and all Liens or options in favor of, or adverse claims of, any other Person, except the security interests created by this Agreement. 4.7 Investment Accounts.

Neither the First Lien Administrative Agent nor any other First Lien Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. 7.3 Investment Property.

In addition to the rights of the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties specified in Section 7.1 with respect to payments of Receivables, if a First Lien Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks, Cash Equivalents and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the First Lien Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the First Lien Administrative Agent, if required). All Proceeds received by the First Lien Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the First Lien Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held by the First Lien Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the First Lien Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 7.5. 21
7.5 Application of Proceeds.

If a First Lien Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the First Lien Administrative Agent, on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the First Lien Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the First Lien 22
Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the First Lien Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the First Lien Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the First Lien Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the First Lien Administrative Agent's request, to assemble the First Lien Collateral and make it available to the First Lien Administrative Agent at places which the First Lien Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. The First Lien Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 7.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the First Lien Collateral or in any way relating to the First Lien Collateral or the rights of the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the First Lien Obligations, in such order as the First Lien Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the First Lien Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the First Lien Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of First Lien Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition. 7.7 Registration Rights. (a) If the First Lien Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 7.6, and if in the opinion of the First Lien Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be, in the opinion of the First Lien Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the First Lien Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any and all jurisdictions which the First Lien Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act. 23
(b) Each Grantor recognizes that the First Lien Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The First Lien Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so. (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 7.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any applicable Requirement of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 7.7 will cause irreparable injury to the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties, that the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 7.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no First Lien Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement. 7.8 Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the First Lien Collateral are insufficient to pay its First Lien Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to collect such deficiency. 7.9 Section 7 for the Exclusive Benefit of the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 7 are for the exclusive benefit of the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties and that the provisions of this Section 7 do not apply to the Second Lien Administrative Agent or the other Second Lien Secured Parties in any manner whatsoever. Section 8. SECOND LIEN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT REMEDIAL PROVISIONS Subject, in each case, to the provisions of Section 14 of the Credit Agreement, each Grantor covenants and agrees with the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Discharge of Second Lien Obligations: 8.1 Certain Matters Relating to Receivables.

After the occurrence of a Second Lien Event of Default, each such deposit of Proceeds of Receivables shall be accompanied by a report identifying in reasonable detail the nature and source of the payments included in the deposit. 24
(b) At the Second Lien Administrative Agent's request, after the occurrence of a Second Lien Event of Default each Grantor shall deliver to the Second Lien Administrative Agent all original and other documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions which gave rise to the Receivables, including, without limitation, all original orders, invoices and shipping receipts and permit any of the Second Lien Administrative Agent's officers, employees or agents, at any time or times, in the name of the Second Lien Administrative Agent, any designee of the Second Lien Administrative Agent or the Borrower, to confirm the validity, amount or any other matter relating to Receivables by mail, telephone, electronic communication, personal inspection or otherwise. The Borrower shall cooperate fully with the Second Lien Administrative Agent in an effort to facilitate and promptly conclude any such process. 8.2 Communications with Obligors; Grantors Remain Liable. (a) The Second Lien Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Second Lien Event of Default communicate with obligors under the Receivables and parties to the Contracts to verify with them to the Second Lien Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Receivables or Contracts. (b) Upon the request of the Second Lien Administrative Agent, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Second Lien Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables and parties to the Contracts that the Receivables and the Contracts have been assigned to the Second Lien Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Second Lien Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Second Lien Administrative Agent. (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Receivables and Contracts to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto. Neither the Second Lien Administrative Agent nor any other Second Lien Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. 8.3 Investment Property. (a) Unless a Second Lien Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall have given notice to the relevant Grantor of the Second Lien Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to Section 8.3(b), each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Stock and all payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate or other organizational rights with respect to the Investment Property; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other organizational right exercised or other action taken which, in the Second Lien Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, would impair the Second Lien Collateral or which would be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 25
(b) If a Second Lien Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds paid in respect of the Investment Property and make application thereof to the Second Lien Obligations in such order as the Second Lien Administrative Agent may determine, and (ii) any or all of the Investment Property shall be registered in the name of the Second Lien Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Second Lien Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (x) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such Investment Property at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (y) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Investment Property as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or other organizational structure of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Second Lien Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Second Lien Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it, but the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. (c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Pledged Stock or Pledged Notes pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Second Lien Administrative Agent in writing that (x) states that a Second Lien Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the Pledged Stock and Pledged Notes directly to the Second Lien Administrative Agent. (d) If a Second Lien Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply the balance from any Deposit Account or instruct the bank at which any Deposit Account is maintained to pay the balance of any Deposit Account to or for the benefit of the Second Lien Administrative Agent. 8.4 Proceeds to be Turned Over To Second Lien Administrative Agent. In addition to the rights of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties specified in Section 8.1 with respect to payments of Receivables, if a Second Lien Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks, Cash Equivalents and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Second Lien Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Second Lien Administrative Agent, if required). All Proceeds received by the Second Lien Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the Second Lien Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held by the Second Lien Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the Second Lien Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 8.5. 26
8.5 Application of Proceeds. If a Second Lien Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Second Lien Administrative Agent's election, the Second Lien Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of Proceeds constituting Second Lien Collateral, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, in payment of the Second Lien Obligations in the following order: (a) First, to the payment of all costs and expenses of any sale, collection or other realization on the Second Lien Collateral, including reasonable compensation to the Second Lien Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent and their agents and counsel, and reimbursement for all other costs, expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Second Lien Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent in connection therewith (including as described in Section 8.6 hereof), and all amounts for which Second Lien Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent is entitled to indemnification hereunder and all advances made by Second Lien Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the applicable Grantor, and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by Second Lien Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document and to the payment or reimbursement of all indemnification obligations, fees, costs and expenses owing to the Administrative Agent or the Second Lien Administrative Agent hereunder or under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, all in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof; (b) Second, to pay accrued and unpaid fees and expenses of the Second Lien Secured Parties under the Loan Documents; (c) Third, for application by it towards payment of amounts then due and owing and remaining unpaid in respect of the Second Lien Obligations, pro rata among the Second Lien Facility Lenders according to the amounts of the Second Lien Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Second Lien Facility Lenders; (d) Fourth, for application by it towards prepayment of the Second Lien Obligations, pro rata among the Second Lien Facility Lenders according to the amounts of the Second Lien Obligations then held by the Second Lien Facility Lenders; and (e) Fifth, any balance of such Proceeds remaining after the Discharge of Second Lien Obligations shall be paid over to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. 8.6 Code and Other Remedies. If a Second Lien Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Second Lien Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Second Lien Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Second Lien Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Second Lien Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Second Lien Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the Second Lien Administrative Agent or 27
any other Second Lien Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Second Lien Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Second Lien Administrative Agent's request, to assemble the Second Lien Collateral and make it available to the Second Lien Administrative Agent at places which the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. The Second Lien Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 8.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Second Lien Collateral or in any way relating to the Second Lien Collateral or the rights of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Second Lien Obligations, in such order as the Second Lien Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the Second Lien Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Second Lien Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Second Lien Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition. 8.7 Registration Rights. (a) If the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 8.6, and if in the opinion of the Second Lien Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be, in the opinion of the Second Lien Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the second public offering of the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Second Lien Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Second Lien Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act. (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Second Lien Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Second Lien Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so. 28
(c) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 8.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any applicable Requirement of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 8.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties, that the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 8.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Second Lien Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement. 8.8 Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Second Lien Collateral are insufficient to pay its Second Lien Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Second Lien Administrative Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party to collect such deficiency. 8.9 Section 8 for the Exclusive Benefit of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree and acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 8 are for the exclusive benefit of the Second Lien Administrative Agent and the other Second Lien Secured Parties and that the provisions of this Section 8 do not apply to the First Lien Administrative Agent or the other First Lien Secured Parties in any manner whatsoever. Section 9. THE FIRST LIEN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT Subject, in each case, to the provisions of Section 14 of the Credit Agreement, each Grantor covenants and agrees with the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties that: 9.1 First Lien Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc. (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the First Lien Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the First Lien Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following: (i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other First Lien Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the First Lien Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other First Lien Collateral whenever payable; 29
(ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the First Lien Administrative Agent may request to evidence the First Lien Administrative Agent's and the other First Lien Secured Parties' security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby; (iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the First Lien Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof; (iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 7.6 or 7.7, any indorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the First Lien Collateral; and (v) (1) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the First Lien Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the First Lien Administrative Agent or as the First Lien Administrative Agent shall direct; (2) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any First Lien Collateral; (3) sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the First Lien Collateral; (4) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the First Lien Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any First Lien Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any First Lien Collateral; (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the First Lien Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (7) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the First Lien Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (8) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the First Lien Collateral as fully and completely as though the First Lien Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the First Lien Administrative Agent's option and such Grantor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the First Lien Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the First Lien Collateral and the First Lien Administrative Agent's and the other First Lien Secured Parties' security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do. Anything in this Section 9.1(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the First Lien Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 9.1(a) unless a First Lien Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. (b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the First Lien Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement. (c) The expenses of the First Lien Administrative Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 9.1, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on any category of past due ABR Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the First Lien Administrative Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the First Lien Administrative Agent on demand. 30
(d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released. 9.2 Duty of First Lien Administrative Agent. The First Lien Administrative Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the First Lien Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the First Lien Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the First Lien Administrative Agent, any other First Lien Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the First Lien Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any First Lien Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the First Lien Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the First Lien Administrative Agent's and the other First Lien Secured Parties' interests in the First Lien Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the First Lien Administrative Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The First Lien Administrative Agent and the other First Lien Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 9.3 Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to any applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the First Lien Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the First Lien Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the First Lien Administrative Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the First Lien Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
