Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release: LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES THREE-FOR-TWO STOCK SPLIT AND INCREASED CASH DIVIDEND New York, NY, - (Business Wire) - December 8, 2004. Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE and PCX: LUK) ("Leucadia") announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a three-for-two split of Leucadia's common shares. The split will be effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend to be paid on December 31, 2004 to holders of record of the common shares at the close of business on December 23, 2004. Leucadia also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend equal to $0.375 per Leucadia common share (on a pre-split basis) payable on December 31, 2004 to record holders of Leucadia common shares on December 23, 2004.
