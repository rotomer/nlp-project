Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On May 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in conjuntion with the Board of Directors, awarded bonuses for 2004 to each of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the Board and President, respectively, of the Company, under the Company's 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan in the amount of $1,403,750. The Incentive Bonus Plan provides for annual incentive bonuses to be paid to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each fiscal year through 2014. The amount of the annual incentive bonus awarded to each participant in any given year is subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. The Incentive Bonus Plan is designed so that the cash bonuses awarded under the plan will qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Compensation Committee did not take action to reduce the amount of the 2004 incentive bonus for Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg. 2
