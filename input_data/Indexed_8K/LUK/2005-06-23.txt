Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. A. On June 17, 2005, Leucadia National Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with VarTec Telecom, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Excel Communications Marketing, Inc., Excel Management Service, Inc., Excel Products, Inc., Excel Telecommunications, Inc., Excel Telecommunications of Virginia, Inc., Excelcom, Inc., Telco Communications Group, Inc., Telco Network Services, Inc., VarTec Business Trust, VarTec Properties, Inc., VarTec Resource Services, Inc., VarTec Solutions, Inc., VarTec Telecom Holding Company, VarTec Telecom International Holding Company and VarTec Telecom of Virginia, Inc., (collectively referred to as the "VarTec Companies"). The VarTec Companies are debtors-in-possession under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The VarTec Companies are telecommunications carriers that provide long distance, local, wireless and Internet access services to residential, midsize business and wholesale customers in the United States. Pursuant to the Agreement and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court administering the VarTec Companies' chapter 11 proceedings, the Company will acquire substantially all of the assets and certain operating liabilities of the VarTec Companies. The cash portion of the purchase price under the Agreement is $61.5 million, if the Bankruptcy Court order approving the transaction is entered on or before July 31, 2005 or $58 million if the order is entered after July 31, 2005. The purchase price will be subject to a working capital adjustment that could increase or decrease the price based upon the change in VarTec Companies' working capital during the period from April 30, 2005 and the date on or about the entry of the Bankruptcy Court order approving the sale to the Company. The Company will also be required to fund any cure payments under certain executory contracts that would be assigned in the transaction with the consent of the Bankruptcy Court. The VarTec Companies have the right to solicit competing bids, which could result in Leucadia not being the winning bidder. In such event, the Company would be entitled to a $2 million termination fee, which is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve this termination fee, or certain other elements of the bid procedures, the Company will be relieved of its obligations under the Agreement. In addition to Bankruptcy Court approval, the closing is also subject to regulatory approvals. B. On June 17, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company, in conjunction with the Compensation Committee of the Board, awarded a $200,000 discretionary bonus to H.E. Scruggs, Vice President of the Company. 2
