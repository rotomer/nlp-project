Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. As previously reported by Leucadia National Corporation in its Form 8-K filed April 28, 2005, Leucadia was awaiting receipt of annual financial statements of ATX Communications, Inc. in order to determine whether or not the acquisition of 94% of the outstanding stock of ATX was an acquisition that was required to be reported under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K. Such financial statements have now been reviewed by Leucadia. As a result, Leucadia has determined that the acquisition was not an acquisition that was required to be reported under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K. Accordingly, as previously reported, Leucadia is hereby amending its April 28, 2005 Form 8-K to reflect that no Form 8-K filing is required and accordingly will not be filing financial information as part of this Form 8-K. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired. None. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information. None. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
