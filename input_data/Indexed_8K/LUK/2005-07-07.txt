Subject to the credits provided in Section 3.1.A, Section 3.1.B, Section 3.1.F and Section 3.1.G, SBC and its Affiliates shall purchase from WilTel and pay in accordance with this Section 3.1 for at least (i) $600,000,000 of Included Services during the period beginning January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2007 (such period, the "First Purchase Period") and (ii) $75,000,000 of Included Services during the period beginning January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2009 (such period, the "Second Purchase Period") (collectively, the "Purchase Commitment"). 2. Included Services. "Included Services" shall mean (a) all Services provided by WilTel to SBC under this Agreement that are not Excluded Services (as hereinafter defined); (b) all services provided by WilTel to SBC under the Wholesale Services Agreement that are not Excluded Services; and (c) with respect to the portion of the First Purchase Period that is prior to the Effective Date, all services purchased by SBC and its Affiliates pursuant to any Alliance Agreement that (i) with respect to the period from January 1, 2005 through and including April 30, 2005, are set forth on Schedule A8 as "Included Services" or (ii) with respect to the period from May 1, 2005 through and including the Effective Date, are not Excluded Services. In addition, after the consummation of any business combination involving WilTel with another carrier, "Included Services" shall include all Off-Net Services provided to SBC by WilTel through such other carrier. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall Included Services include any services other than Included Services purchased from WilTel under this Agreement and Included Services shall exclude any services purchased directly by SBC under any agreement with another carrier with whom WilTel may combine. 17 of 53
Schedule A8 sets forth all Included Services and all Excluded Services purchased by SBC and its Affiliates from WilTel during the period from January 1, 2005 through and including April 30, 2005 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Parties agree that the aggregate amount of Included Services purchased by SBC and its Affiliates during the period from January 1, 2005 through and including April 30, 2005 is $98,819,657, and that $91,572,946 of such amount has been paid to WilTel on or prior to the Effective Date and the Purchase Commitment for the First Purchase Period is hereby reduced by such $91,572,946 previously paid to WilTel. 3. Excluded Services. "Excluded Services" under this Agreement and the Wholesale Services Agreement shall mean those Services provided by WilTel to SBC on a Pass Through Basis in compliance with this Agreement and such other Services purchased by SBC from WilTel for which the entire amount paid to WilTel by SBC was paid by WilTel to a Third Party or an SBC Affiliate consistent with the allocation methodology in effect on February 9, 2005 and used in the preparation of Schedule A8, or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties. To the extent that a Service provided hereunder consists of both Included Services and Excluded Services components (i.e., an Off-Net Service provided on a Pass Through Basis with a mark-up or profit margin to WilTel) consistent with Schedule A8 or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, the amount of the Pass Through Basis component invoiced for such Service shall be deemed an Excluded Service and the amount of the mark-up or profit margin retained by WilTel and invoiced as such for such Service shall be deemed an Included Service. For the avoidance of any doubt, no payment in respect of Excluded Services shall count toward the Purchase Commitment. 4. Certification. Each month during the Term until the Purchase Commitment is fully utilized, WilTel shall deliver a certificate signed by its senior finance officer (as of the Effective Date, WilTel's Senior Vice President of Finance) certifying that, to such officer's knowledge after diligent inquiry, the calculation of Included Services and Excluded Services set forth in the monthly accounting required to be delivered in accordance with Section 3.1.D (x) is true and correct, (y) has been done in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the methodologies for pricing services in effect as of February 9, 2005 or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing and (z) that the amount reflected as Excluded Services consists solely of amounts charged on a Pass Through Basis or otherwise paid by WilTel directly to Third Parties or SBC Affiliates in accordance with the definition of Excluded Services and in compliance with Section 8.1.D and Schedule A8. Schedule A8 hereto includes the form of such officer's certificate which shall be delivered to SBC together with the monthly accounting deliveries to be made pursuant to Section 3.1.D. 5. Audit. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the First Purchase Period, SBC shall have the right to conduct periodic reviews of WilTel's books and records (including books and records relating to original invoices, bills and payments to WilTel from Third Parties or SBC Affiliates and 18 of 53
the allocation of amounts to SBC) to verify to SBC's reasonable satisfaction that the amounts of such payments by SBC for Excluded Services do not exceed WilTel's actual or properly allocated costs to such Third Parties or SBC Affiliates for such Excluded Services. In such periodic reviews, SBC may review each of the following categories no more than once per year: (a) access/egress-variable costs; (b) access/egress-fixed costs; (c) IXC-Off-Net; and (d) Local Access - Off-Net; with such reviews to be at the time and in the manner mutually agreed to between SBC and WilTel. Any such periodic review shall be (i) at SBC's sole cost and expense, (ii) performed by SBC personnel, (iii) limited in scope to determining whether amounts have been properly identified and calculated as Excluded Services, and for no other purpose, and (iv) designed specifically to achieve such purposes using sampling and other time/cost saving techniques as agreed upon by WilTel with an objective to limit disruption of WilTel's business. Additionally, during the First Purchase Period and to the extent SBC does not gain reasonable satisfaction though these periodic reviews, SBC shall have the right pursuant to this Section 3.1.A.5 from time to time (but no more frequently than once per month), as determined by SBC, to audit WilTel's books and records (including books and records relating to original invoices, bills and payments to WilTel from Third Parties or SBC Affiliates and the allocation of amounts to SBC) to verify to SBC's reasonable satisfaction that the amounts of such payments by SBC for Excluded Services do not exceed WilTel's actual or properly allocated costs to such Third Parties or SBC Affiliates for such Excluded Services. Any such audit pursuant to this Section 3.1.A.5 shall be (1) at SBC's sole cost and expense, (2) performed by a Third Party auditor selected by SBC and reasonably satisfactory to WilTel, (3) limited in scope to determining whether amounts have been properly identified and calculated as Excluded Services, and for no other purpose, and (4) reasonably designed to achieve such purposes (using sampling and other time/cost saving techniques where appropriate) with an objective to limit disruption of WilTel's business. In furtherance of the foregoing, WilTel shall retain such records and reasonable billing detail for disputed items until such dispute has been fully and finally resolved. WilTel shall have the right to review the results of any such audit performed on behalf of SBC. Upon satisfaction in full of the Purchase Commitment and the other provisions of this Section 3.1, such audit rights pursuant to this Section 3.1.A.5 shall terminate. B. Credit Against Purchase Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during each month in calendar year 2005 beginning with the Effective Date, SBC shall be entitled to a monthly credit against any payment that it would otherwise have to make for any services purchased from WilTel pursuant to this Agreement, the Wholesale Services Agreement or any Alliance Agreement in calendar year 2005 in an amount equal to $18,000,000 credited in five equal monthly installments commencing with the invoice for Services rendered in the month of August 2005. C. Payment Upon Expiration of Purchase Commitment Periods. In the event that SBC fails to fulfill the applicable portion of the Purchase Commitment during the First Purchase Period or the Second Purchase Period (each, a "Purchase Commitment Period"), SBC shall pay WilTel the unfulfilled amount (after accounting for the payments and credits referenced in Section 3.1.A, Section 3.1.B, Section 3.1.F and Section 3.1.G) of the applicable portion of the Purchase Commitment for such Purchase Commitment Period (such amount being a "Purchase Commitment Payment") in accordance with Section 3.1.E. Any Purchase Commitment Payment shall constitute a prepayment for Included Services to be provided during the remaining duration of the Term and, to the extent that any Purchase Commitment Payment or any portion thereof remains 19 of 53
unused at the end of the Term, all such remaining amounts shall constitute a prepayment for Included Services to be provided to SBC by WilTel thereafter pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Amounts owed by SBC in respect of Included Services provided by WilTel after a Purchase Commitment Payment has been made shall be credited dollar-for-dollar against such Purchase Commitment Payment until its balance has been completely offset by amounts credited in respect of Included Services. After all Purchase Commitment Payments, if any, have been completely offset in accordance with this Agreement, SBC shall resume paying for Included Services provided by WilTel in accordance with this Agreement. If upon the expiration of this Agreement any Purchase Commitment Payment (or portion thereof) has not been completely offset, SBC shall be entitled to receive Included Services from WilTel that would constitute "Included Services" under the terms of this Agreement sufficient to offset the remaining balance thereof, and SBC shall be entitled to apply such remaining balance in payment for such Included Services without limitation, irrespective of when such Included Services may be provided. Following the expiration of the Term, SBC shall attempt in good faith to purchase Services as promptly as reasonably practicable to utilize any remaining balance of the Purchase Commitment Payment. Following the expiration of the Term, WilTel shall have no obligation to continue to provide any specific Services for the benefit of SBC. In the event that SBC purchases Included Services during the First Purchase Period in an amount that exceeds the applicable portion of the Purchase Commitment for the First Purchase Period, then the applicable portion of the Purchase Commitment for the Second Purchase Period shall be reduced by the amount of such excess. D. Monthly and Quarterly Accounting. Except pursuant to the credits provided in Section 3.1.A, Section 3.1.B, Section 3.1.F and Section 3.1.G, the outstanding balance of the Purchase Commitment shall not be reduced unless and until SBC remits payment to WilTel for the Included Services purchased, at which time the outstanding balance of the Purchase Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of such payment. Once every three (3) months, the Parties shall review and agree upon the amount of the outstanding balance of the Purchase Commitment (or, if applicable, the unused balance of any Purchase Commitment Payment). To assist in tracking performance under the Purchase Commitment, on or before the fifteenth (15th) Day of each month during the Term, until the Parties agree that the Purchase Commitment is fully satisfied (or, if applicable, that each Purchase Commitment Payment has been completely offset as provided in Section 3.1.C), WilTel shall initially calculate, the amount of Included Services, and report to SBC such calculation, of the outstanding balance of the Purchase Commitment (and, if applicable, any Purchase Commitment Payment) as of the first (1st) Business Day of such month, which statement shall include the amount by which the Purchase Commitment would be reduced upon SBC's payment in respect of the Included Services for the previous month. SBC shall have the right to review and dispute any such initial calculation for a period of fifteen (15) Days after SBC's receipt of such initial calculation. E. Purchase Commitment Payments. No later than thirty (30) Days after the termination of a Purchase Commitment Period, WilTel shall prepare and deliver to SBC a draft of the final accounting of SBC's purchases during such Purchase Commitment Period of Included Services, including all invoices for Included Services provided through the end of such Purchase Commitment Period (the "Year End Invoices") and, if applicable, an invoice for the amount of the applicable Purchase Commitment Payment. The Parties shall jointly review WilTel's calculation of the amount of such purchases and the remaining balance, if any, of the applicable portion of the Purchase Commitment as specified on such invoice. If WilTel delivers an invoice to SBC for such Purchase Commitment Payment, then no later than thirty (30) Days after SBC's receipt of such invoice (together with such final accounting and such Year End Invoices), SBC shall pay WilTel the portion of such Purchase Commitment Payment that exceeds the amount of all unpaid 20 of 53
Year End Invoices for such Purchase Commitment Period and that is undisputed, provided that any dispute with respect to the calculation of such Purchase Commitment Payment shall be limited to whether Services included in the calculation of such Purchase Commitment Payment constitute Included Services as opposed to Excluded Services. Upon resolution of any such dispute, SBC shall promptly pay WilTel any agreed upon amount within thirty (30) Days after the resolution of such dispute. The amount of any unpaid Year End Invoices shall be paid by SBC as provided in Article 11 hereunder, to the extent deducted from a Purchase Commitment Payment, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the extent the resolution of any disputes result in a reduction of the invoiced amounts. F. Additional Credits. 1. Unavailability or Termination of Included Services. During the Term, in the event that WilTel, for any reason whatsoever, ceases to provide or terminates any Included Service that WilTel is provisioning to SBC of the type that was being provided to SBC by WilTel as of February 9, 2005, the Purchase Commitment shall be reduced as set forth below. The amount by which the Purchase Commitment shall be reduced shall be equal to the product of (i) the aggregate amount spent by SBC for such Included Service as accurately reflected on the monthly invoice representing full month of usage delivered to SBC immediately preceding WilTel's Notice to SBC pursuant to this Section 3.1.F.1 that it will not provide such Included Service or that it has terminated such Included Service, as the case may be (which Notice WilTel shall provide SBC promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Days after any such termination or cessation of any Included Service), and (ii) the number of calendar months remaining until the end of the Term. For the avoidance of any doubt, (a) if SBC terminates a Service as a result of a Chronic Outage, the applicable credit shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.1.F.2 and not this Section 3.1.F.1 and (b) if SBC's traffic for 1+ Voice Service exceeds the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth on Appendix G for such 1+ Voice Service, no credit pursuant to this Section 3.1.F.1 shall be available if WilTel is unable to provide 1+ Voice Service above the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth on Appendix G. During the First Purchase Period, if SBC elects to receive a credit pursuant to this Section 3.1.F.1 for such a termination or cessation of an Included Service, such termination or cessation shall not constitute a default pursuant to Section 13.1. 2. Services Terminated by SBC. SBC shall receive a credit against the Purchase Commitment for all Services SBC terminates as a result of a Chronic Outage in respect of such Service. If SBC so terminates any Service other than a 1+ Voice Service (and the ability to terminate is not disputed by WilTel or SBC prevails in any such dispute), the amount of the associated credit against the Purchase Commitment shall be equal to the amount that would have been payable for all such terminated Circuits: (i) during the First Purchase Period, for a one (1) year period after the date of such termination or (ii) during the Second Purchase Period, for a six (6) month period after the date of such termination. If SBC so terminates a 1+ Voice Service as a result of a Chronic Outage for 1+ Voice Services (and the ability to terminate is not disputed by WilTel or SBC prevails in any such dispute), the amount of the associated credit against the Purchase Commitment shall be equal to the amount that would have been charged for actual MOUs of 1+ Voice Services, to the extent such amount would have been included as an Included Service, for the relevant month(s); provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate 21 of 53
credit to be applied pursuant to this sentence in respect of Chronic Outages for 1+ Voice Services exceed $20,000,000. Nothing in this Section 3.1.F.2 is intended to limit any other rights or remedies that may be available to SBC under this Agreement, including the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.2 hereof. The Parties agree to work together in good faith in an effort not to exceed the applicable maximum traffic volume per Circuit set forth on Appendix G. 3. Credits and Offsets. If SBC receives any credits or offsets against any amounts otherwise payable by SBC pursuant to this Agreement for Included Services (including any credits or offsets pursuant to any SLAs or remedies set forth in any Schedule), the amount of all such credits and offsets shall be deemed to have been paid by SBC for purposes of calculating the outstanding balance of the Purchase Commitment (and, if any Purchase Commitment Payment has been made, such amount shall increase the remaining balance of the Purchase Commitment Payment). 4. New or Additional 1+ Voice Services. If, at any time during the First Purchase Period, (a) SBC requests any new or additional On-Net 1+ Voice Service, (b) such requested Service would not cause traffic to exceed the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G, (c) WilTel fails to offer and provide such Service, and (d) SBC obtains or provisions substitute services (which, at SBC's discretion, may be obtained from any provider including SBC, an Affiliate of SBC or any Third Party), then the Purchase Commitment shall be reduced each month until the earlier of the end of the First Purchase Period or term of the requested Service by the aggregate amount equal to the product of (x) the number of MOUs so requested by SBC and for which SBC obtained substitute service (up to the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G) and (y) the price per MOU that would have been payable for such Service if it had been provided by WilTel pursuant to this Agreement. For each month for which SBC claims a credit hereunder, SBC shall deliver a certificate signed by the Vice President - Corporate Finance of SBC certifying to such officer's knowledge (1) the number of MOUs which SBC was required to obtain from a provider other than WilTel as a result of WilTel's failure to offer and provide new or additional On-Net 1+ Voice Services under this provision and (2) that the provision of such MOUs by WilTel would not have caused SBC traffic to have exceeded the applicable maximum traffic volume for such month as set forth in Appendix G. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to provide Services (A) as a result of normal outages, (B) in a manner consistent with the timeliness of past provisioning performance or (C) as a result of the failure, despite WilTel's commercially reasonable efforts, of a Third Party (including an SBC ILEC) to perform, shall, in each case, not constitute a failure to offer and provide Services hereunder. 5. New or Additional DS-1/DS-3 Services. If, at any time during the First Purchase Period, SBC requests any new or additional On-Net DS-1 Service or On-Net DS-3 Service, irrespective of whether it is provisioned as part of an ATM Service, Frame Relay Service or Private Line Service, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and WilTel fails to offer and provide such Service, and SBC obtains or provisions substitute services (which, at SBC's discretion, may be obtained from any provider including SBC, an Affiliate of SBC or any Third Party), then the Purchase Commitment shall be reduced by the amount equal to the price that would be payable for such Services pursuant to this Agreement for the term of the Circuit requested (in the event that the term of the Circuit extends beyond December 31, 2009, such credit shall only apply until December 31, 2009). For each period for which SBC claims a credit hereunder, SBC shall deliver a certificate signed by the 22 of 53
Vice President - Corporate Finance of SBC certifying that SBC actually obtained Services that WilTel failed to offer and provide hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to provide Services as a result of the failure, despite WilTel's commercially reasonable efforts, of a Third Party (including an SBC ILEC) to perform, shall not constitute a failure to offer and provide Services hereunder. 6. New or Additional OC-n Services. All On-Net OC-n Services requested under this Section 3.1.F.6 shall be subject to a term of at least one (1) year. If SBC requests a Service that requires an On-Net OC-n Circuit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including provisioning intervals sufficient to enable WilTel to perform hereunder), WilTel shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to reconfigure its capacity to accommodate the requested Service, provided that WilTel shall not be required to expend any new capital in connection with such requested Service or to take any action which is reasonably likely to disrupt the WilTel Network. If SBC shall request an On-Net OC-n Service, WilTel shall promptly respond to any such Service request with a price quote on an Individual Case Basis. This price quote shall reasonably reflect past practices for such types of price quotes and include any additional capital requirements WilTel may have in provisioning such requested Service. If SBC elects, at SBC's sole discretion, not to accept such price quote, then WilTel shall have no obligation to provision such requested Service. If SBC elects to accept such price quote, WilTel shall provide such requested Service in accordance with such request, provided that reasonably sufficient time has been given to allow WilTel to install such requested Service. If WilTel has available capacity that can be reconfigured and WilTel fails to take commercially reasonable efforts to reconfigure as described above, SBC shall be entitled to a reduction in the Purchase Commitment calculated in the same manner as set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.1.F.5. For each period for which SBC claims a credit hereunder, SBC shall deliver a certificate signed by the Vice President - Corporate Finance of SBC certifying that SBC actually obtained Services that WilTel failed to offer and provide hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to provide Services as a result of the failure, despite WilTel's commercially reasonable efforts, of a Third Party (including an SBC ILEC) to perform, shall not constitute a failure to offer and provide Services hereunder. G. Purchase or Lease of Assets. At any time after the Effective Date and during the Term, SBC may submit a written request to purchase or lease specific WilTel assets (including IRUs, fiber routes, interests in real property, switches, switch infrastructure, network management systems, operational support systems, customer network management systems and network facilities) (each a "Requested Asset"). WilTel will consider the sale or lease of any Requested Asset in good faith and within thirty (30) Days of receipt of any such request, and if WilTel is willing to sell or lease such Requested Asset, WilTel will present a written offer to SBC containing a price for each Requested Asset. If SBC agrees to such price, the Parties will work diligently and in good faith to negotiate terms for WilTel to sell or lease each Requested Asset to SBC and WilTel will reasonably provide due diligence information as requested by SBC relating to the Requested Assets. If the Parties reach agreement and close a transaction transferring Requested Assets to SBC (or one of its Affiliates), the aggregate consideration paid (including the mutually agreed fair market value of any non-cash consideration paid) shall be credited, dollar for dollar, against the Purchase Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, WilTel shall not be obligated to sell or lease any assets requested by SBC to be sold hereunder unless WilTel agrees, in its sole discretion, to sell or lease such assets to SBC. 23 of 53
3.2 Quality of Service. ------------------ A. For each of the following periods (each a "Quality of Service Period"): (i) the period beginning on January 1, 2006 and ending on December 31, 2006 (the "First QoS Period") and (ii) the period beginning on January 1, 2007 and ending on December 31, 2007 (the "Second QoS Period"), subject to any credit pursuant to Section 3.2.F: 1.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Service Assurance End of Year Bonus for the Second QoS Period shall not include any Service Assurance Monthly Bonus amounts not paid by SBC due to WilTel's failure to meet the Minimum Service Assurance Standard in [***] of the Second QoS Period. 2. Service Delivery. If WilTel achieves the Minimum Service Delivery Standard for the requisite period, SBC shall pay to WilTel up to $3,750,000 with respect to the First QoS Period (such payment a "Service Delivery Bonus") as follows: i. In each calendar month in the First QoS Period, if WilTel achieves the Minimum Service Delivery Standard for such month, SBC shall pay to WilTel the Service Delivery Monthly Bonus. For purposes hereof, "Service Delivery Monthly Bonus" shall mean [***]. ii.

At the end of the First QoS Period, if WilTel has achieved the Minimum Service Delivery Standard in [***] in the First QoS Period, SBC shall pay to WilTel the Service Delivery End of Year Bonus. For purposes 24 of 53
hereof, "Service Delivery End of Year Bonus" shall mean the aggregate amount of (i) [***] and (ii) any Service Delivery Monthly Bonus amount not paid by SBC during the First QoS Period. 3. Migration. If WilTel achieves the Minimum Migration Standard for the requisite period, SBC shall pay to WilTel up to $8,749,996 with respect to the First QoS Period and up to $12,500,008 with respect to the Second QoS Period (each such payment a "Migration Bonus") as follows: i. In each calendar month in the First QoS Period or the Second QoS Period, if WilTel achieves the Minimum Migration Standard for such month, SBC shall pay to WilTel the applicable Migration Monthly Bonus. For purposes hereof, "Migration Monthly Bonus" shall mean (x) for any month during the First QoS Period, [***], and (y) for any month during the Second QoS Period, [***]. ii. In each calendar month in the applicable Quality of Service Period, if WilTel fails to achieve the Minimum Migration Standard, SBC shall not be required to pay the Migration Monthly Bonus for such month. iii. At the end of each Quality of Service Period, if WilTel has achieved the Minimum Migration Standard in [***] in such Quality of Service Period, SBC shall pay to WilTel the Migration End of Year Bonus.

B. Certification. For each month in each Quality of Service Period, WilTel shall submit to SBC, no later than fifteen (15) Days after the end of such month, a certificate (together with reasonably sufficient information, consistent with current practices between the Parties as of the Effective Date) indicating whether WilTel has or has not achieved the Minimum Service Assurance Standard, Minimum Service Delivery Standard and the Minimum Migration Standard, as applicable, for such month. SBC shall have fifteen (15) Days from the receipt of such certificate and information to dispute the accuracy of the certificate or to pay the Service Assurance Monthly Bonus, Service Delivery Monthly Bonus and the Migration Monthly Bonus, as applicable, to the extent required pursuant to Section 3.2.A. In the event that SBC does not dispute the accuracy of such certificate (unless such certificate indicates that WilTel has not achieved the Minimum Service Assurance Standard, Minimum Service Delivery Standard or the Minimum Migration Standard, as applicable) within such fifteen (15) Day period from the receipt of such certificate, WilTel shall be deemed to have achieved the Minimum Service Assurance Standard, Minimum Service Delivery Standard and the Minimum Migration Standard, as applicable, for such month. SBC shall promptly pay any Service Assurance Monthly Bonus, Service Delivery Monthly Bonus and Migration Monthly Bonus payments, as applicable, together with any End of Year Bonus, if applicable, in each case that is due and payable upon the resolution of any 25 of 53
disputes under this Section 3.2.B in WilTel's favor. For the avoidance of doubt, if for any period a particular Service Metric is no longer applicable for any reason set forth in this Agreement, including (i) due to the decrease in MOU below the applicable thresholds as set forth in Appendix B, (ii) because SBC traffic exceeds the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G or (iii) because SBC fails to fund capital expenditures required to be funded pursuant to Section 3.3, such Service Metric shall be deemed to have been fulfilled with respect to such period for the applicable purposes to the extent specified hereunder in accordance with Appendix B or the relevant provisions of this Agreement. C. No Waiver. For the avoidance of doubt, the determination that a Service Assurance Bonus, Service Delivery Bonus or Migration Bonus is due and payable shall not constitute a waiver of any claim for breach or default related to WilTel's failure to meet any particular Specification, service level or standard set forth or referenced in this Agreement. D. Known Changes. SBC shall use reasonable efforts to advise WilTel of major projects or other known changes in SBC's business that would significantly change SBC's demand for Services. E. Consultation. In the event that WilTel fails to satisfy any Minimum Quality of Service Standard in any calendar month, the Parties shall promptly consult regarding the reasons for the failure to satisfy such Minimum Quality of Service Standard, and jointly discuss how WilTel will improve its performance to satisfy such Minimum Quality of Service Standard in the future. F. Additional Personnel Resources. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that WilTel fails to fully satisfy the Minimum Service Assurance Standard or Minimum Service Delivery Standard [***], in addition to any and all remedies available to SBC in or in connection with this Agreement, the Parties shall promptly consult with each other in order to determine whether additional personnel resources could help WilTel improve its ability to satisfy the applicable Minimum Quality of Service Standard(s). If the Parties, acting in their reasonable discretion, agree that additional personnel could help improve WilTel's performance, then SBC shall have the right to use its own resources to remedy any and all such deficiencies unless and until WilTel has hired sufficient additional personnel to satisfy the applicable Minimum Quality of Service Standard(s) and has satisfied the applicable Minimum Quality of Service Standard(s) for at least one (1) month. Subject to WilTel's applicable legal and other contractual confidentiality obligations (which, to the extent any such obligations require WilTel to restrict SBC's access, shall be disclosed in reasonable detail to SBC), for a reasonable period of time, WilTel will grant SBC reasonable access to WilTel's facilities, systems, equipment, records and network assets, as necessary to allow SBC personnel to assist in remedying such deficiencies, and shall cooperate with SBC to remedy the deficiencies. SBC's exercise of these rights shall not diminish, alter or waive in any respect WilTel's obligation to satisfy the Minimum Quality of Service Standards. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if WilTel satisfies a Minimum Quality of Service Standard with respect to which SBC has exercised its right to provide resources to WilTel under this Section, and as a result SBC is obligated to pay any portion of a Service Delivery Bonus or Service Assurance Bonus as provided in Section 3.2.A, then SBC's expense (including the fully loaded labor cost for any employees) associated with providing such resources shall be credited against any such bonus and reduce the amount to be paid by SBC to WilTel in respect of such bonus. SBC shall provide WilTel sufficient information to substantiate its calculations of any such credit. Furthermore, if for [***] WilTel satisfies each applicable Minimum Quality of Service Standard with respect to which SBC has exercised its right to provide resources to WilTel under this Section, then WilTel may request in writing that SBC cease providing such resources on a date not less than three (3) Days after the delivery of such written request and SBC shall withdraw such resources. 26 of 53
3.3 Voice Network Augmentation. -------------------------- A. Augmentation. On and promptly after the Effective Date, WilTel shall use [***] to fund an augmentation of the WilTel Network as set forth in Appendix G. Appendix G sets forth the maximum traffic volume levels by MOU by switch for 1+ Voice Service that can be transported on the WilTel Network on a monthly basis through the end of the Term. As specified on Appendix G, after completion of the augmentation of the WilTel Network contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 3.3.A, the WilTel Network shall transport an aggregate maximum traffic volume for 1+ Voice Service of [***] MOUs per month through the end of the Term. In the event that SBC's traffic exceeds the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G, then (i) WilTel will use commercially reasonable efforts to transport all SBC traffic [***], (ii) WilTel shall be deemed to have met the Service Assurance Metrics under Section 3.2 for (1) 1+ Voice Service - Switched switchport availability, (2) 1+ Voice Service - Switched MTTR, (3) DAL Service monthly network availability (-aggregate) and (4) DAL Service MTTR, and all SLAs related to 1+ Voice Service, in each case for each month during which SBC's traffic exceeds the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G; and (iii) SBC shall pay for all traffic terminated on other providers via WATS from WilTel on a Pass Through Basis as an Excluded Service; provided, however, WilTel's request for reimbursement for WATS MOUs shall be limited to the number of MOUs by which SBC's traffic for that month exceeded the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G. In addition, in the event that SBC requests that WilTel provide Services for traffic volumes in excess of the applicable maximum traffic volume set forth in Appendix G, WilTel agrees to reasonably cooperate in responding to such request for additional traffic volumes, provided that WilTel shall not be obligated to make any additional capital investment, whether or not funded by SBC. B. Reimbursement Obligations. SBC shall also reimburse WilTel for (i) all non-recurring charges charged by an SBC ILEC, where such non-recurring charges are reasonably incurred by WilTel to carry additional SBC traffic and (ii) all non-recurring charges, termination Liabilities and reconfiguration charges charged by and paid to an SBC LEC from the Effective Date until the end of the Term, up to an aggregate amount for this clause (ii) not to exceed [***]. 3.4 Transition. The Parties acknowledge and agree that during the Term, SBC may transition a substantial proportion of the Services that it currently purchases from WilTel to another provider. The Parties agree to cooperate in developing and implementing an orderly and efficient transition. Upon Notice from SBC ("Transition Notice"), the Parties shall work together in good faith to implement such transition. 27 of 53
3.5 Other Terms. ----------- A. Changes in Transport Services Parameters. 1. Disconnection of Services. SBC may disconnect any 1+ Voice Service with an SOSN prior to the Effective Date on one (1) Business Day's Notice without any Liability to WilTel, except as provided under this Section 3.5. SBC may disconnect any existing non-voice On-Net Transport Service with an SOSN prior to the Effective Date before the expiration of the Minimum Term or any renewal term, if applicable, by giving Notice to WilTel at least thirty (30) Days in advance of the effective date of disconnect. [***] All On-Net Services with SOSNs on or subsequent to the Effective Date shall have a termination Liability equivalent to the sum of the Monthly Recurring Charges for all months remaining in the service term, and SBC shall also reimburse WilTel for any termination liability and/or disconnection fees incurred with any Off-Net Service. These Off-Net Services shall be charged on a Pass Through Basis. i. Notification. WilTel will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify SBC on a monthly basis of any Transport Service with a Minimum Term or renewal term which will expire within the ensuing ninety (90) Days. If SBC does not give WilTel Notice of its intent to disconnect or renew such Circuits within such ninety (90) Day period, WilTel will continue to provide such Transport Service on a month to month basis at the then existing rate applicable to such Circuit; provided that SBC shall bear any increase in the cost of Off-Net Services associated with such Transport Service. 2. Dedicated Circuit Term. The term associated with each Dedicated Circuit will be as set forth on the Service Order (the "Minimum Term"). SBC may order Dedicated Circuits that have a one (1) year or a three (3) year Minimum Term. If no term is specified on the Service Order, the Minimum Term shall be one (1) year. B. Changes in Service Parameters for Local Services. 1. Disconnection of Local Services. With respect to Local Services: i. [***] ii. SBC may disconnect any Local Service after the expiration of the Minimum Term on thirty (30) Days' Notice to WilTel. In such event, SBC's Liability to WilTel shall be limited to any amounts charged by a Third Party or SBC Affiliate, which amounts SBC shall reimburse to WilTel. C. Application of Certain Payments. Any amounts paid in respect of termination Liabilities for On-Net Services under Section 3.5.A.1 shall constitute payments for Included Services and shall be credited against the Purchase Commitment or the Purchase Commitment Payment. Any amounts paid in respect of termination Liabilities and/or disconnection fees for Off-Net Services that arise under Section 3.5.A.1 or any amounts paid in respect of Liabilities under Section 3.5.B.1 shall not constitute payments for Included Services and shall in no event be credited against the Purchase Commitment or the Purchase Commitment Payment. 28 of 53
3.6 Term of New Services. -------------------- A. Order Survival. Orders that do not have a specified term shall be treated as orders subject to a one (1) year minimum term. Except for non-payment or other material breach by SBC, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, any Orders placed, but not installed, prior to the Effective Date shall be invoiced at the monthly prices set forth in the response to the RFQ or ASR/Service Order and shall be subject to a one (1) year minimum term when they are placed in service. B. Service Survival. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, and except for nonpayment or other material breach by the Party purchasing a service ("Purchasing Party"), the Party supplying a Service ("Supplying Party"), subject to Section 7.3, if applicable, shall not disconnect that Service, unless or until the Supplying Party receives a disconnect order ("Disconnect Order") from the Purchasing Party. C. Term Order Survival. Orders which have a specified term are referred to herein as "Term Orders." Each Term Order shall commence on the billing commencement date and shall expire at the end of the term set forth in each Order, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. For On-Net Services, if the Term Order ends before the termination of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, or unless WilTel receives a new Term Order or a Disconnect Order from SBC for such Service, the Services associated with such Term Order shall convert to a monthly order at the same monthly prices charged during the term. For Off-Net Services, WilTel will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify SBC on a monthly basis of any disconnection or renewal of any Circuits with a Minimum Term or renewal term which will expire within ninety (90) Days. If SBC does not give WilTel Notice of its intent to disconnect or renew such Circuits within such ninety (90) Day period, WilTel will continue, on a month to month basis, if Available, or, if not Available, the shortest term then Available, to provide such Off-Net Services on a Pass Through Basis. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the Services associated with a Term Order that expires after the termination of this Agreement shall convert on the date of expiration of such Term Order to a monthly order at the same prices charged during the term. In such event, SBC's Liability to WilTel shall be limited to any amounts charged by Third Party Providers or SBC Affiliates, which amounts SBC shall reimburse to WilTel. 3.7 Continuation of Existing Services. --------------------------------- A. Existing Contractual Arrangements for Collocation Service. The existing contractual arrangements between the Parties or their respective Affiliates relating to Collocation Service, the locations and certain terms of which are set forth in Appendix D, shall continue in full force and effect after the Effective Date in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A11, subject solely to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Collocation Service Order specified in Appendix D and this Agreement (including Schedule A11), the Collocation Service Agreement specified in Appendix D shall prevail. B. DNA Agreement. SBC shall receive Direct Network Access service from WilTel in accordance with the service supplement for Direct Network Access in Annex 1 to Appendix F. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the DNA Agreement and this Agreement, the DNA Agreement shall prevail. 29 of 53
C. Services Generally. [***] On or after January 1, 2008, WilTel may terminate any Service that is being provided to SBC at such time so long as WilTel gives SBC [***] prior Notice of such termination. 3.8 Reconfiguration of Local Access Services Purchased by WilTel. The Parties anticipate that SBC may substantially decrease its purchase of Transport Services from WilTel during the Term of this Agreement. If such a reduction in Transport Services purchased by SBC occurs, WilTel may choose to reconfigure and reduce its Local Access and Off-Net purchases. SBC agrees to comply with all reasonable requests made by WilTel, including by timely providing authorizations, consents and other documentation, to assist WilTel in moving Local Access and Off-Net Services to more cost-effective configurations and, if not detrimental either to SBC or any of its Customers, rearranging SBC's traffic in support of WilTel's grooming of Local Access and Off-Net Facilities; provided, however, that to the extent SBC determines that WilTel's proposed reconfiguration would adversely affect SBC or any of its Customers, SBC's obligations hereunder shall be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to work with WilTel and the affected Customer(s) to attempt to minimize or eliminate such adverse effect in a manner consistent with the Parties' past practices. This assistance may include grooming end-user loops and interoffice transport to new facilities or channels, support in converting WilTel-purchased facilities to LEC-owned facilities where SBC and its Affiliates purchase access directly from the serving Local Exchange Carrier, and other support that WilTel may reasonably deem necessary to optimize its purchase of local access services. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 3.8 shall not allow WilTel to terminate a Service other than in accordance with Section 3.7.C. ARTICLE 4. ORDERING AND INSTALLATION OF WILTEL SERVICES 4.1 Affiliate Orders for Services Provided by WilTel. SBC and its Affiliate SBC Long Distance, LLC, and any other Affiliates of SBC as mutually agreed by the Parties, together with each of their respective successors (collectively, the "Approved Affiliates"), may order Services and/or place Service Orders under this Agreement. WilTel agrees that any Approved Affiliate (including such Approved Affiliate's successors) may place Orders with WilTel that incorporate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and that the term "SBC" shall be deemed to refer to an Approved Affiliate when an Approved Affiliate places an Order with WilTel under this Agreement. SBC shall remain ultimately responsible for all obligations of such Approved Affiliate. 4.2 Ordering Process. SBC and any Approved Affiliate may order Services and/or place Service Orders under this Agreement in accordance with Schedule C. In addition to any other information required to be contained therein, each Firm Price Quote shall specify whether the requested Service will be provisioned On-Net or Off-Net and to the extent that any Services are being provided Off-Net, the amount of the applicable mark-up being charged by WilTel, to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 8.1.B. ARTICLE 5. TROUBLE, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF WILTEL SERVICES 5.1 Network Monitoring. WilTel shall provide network monitoring in accordance with Schedule D. 5.2 Trouble, Maintenance and Repairs. Planned Maintenance, trouble management and reporting and repairs of the WilTel Network shall be provided in accordance with Schedule D. ARTICLE 6. SBC PLATFORM SERVICES 6.1 Platform Services.

B. Additional Platform Services and Features. To the extent that (i) SBC continues to offer the Platform Services or features which it has discontinued providing to WilTel pursuant to Section 6.2.A, upon WilTel's request, SBC will offer to sell such Platform Services and features to WilTel on the prices and terms set forth herein, or (ii) SBC has the existing capability to offer additional Platform Services or features, upon WilTel's request, SBC will offer to sell such Platform Services and features to WilTel upon prices and terms as agreed to by the Parties; PROVIDED THAT ANY SUCH PLATFORM SERVICES OR FEATURES SHALL BE OFFERED AND TRANSFERRED WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY SERVICE LEVEL REQUIREMENTS OR ASSURANCES.

D. Termination for Breach. Either Party may, in addition to its rights available to it at Law or in equity, terminate this Agreement in its entirety and all Orders issued pursuant hereto, if the other Party has substantially failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and such failure materially and adversely affects the expected benefits of this Agreement to the non-breaching Party, and the breaching Party fails to cure such failure within thirty (30) Days from the later of (a) the date on which Notice of such failure is given and (b) if applicable, the date on which any dispute about such failure is resolved in favor of the non-breaching Party in accordance with the terms of Article 12. For the avoidance of any doubt, such non-breaching Party shall not have the right pursuant to this Section 7.2.D to terminate this Agreement or any such Orders if a dispute about such breach is raised and is resolved in favor of the other Party in accordance with the terms of Article 12. In the event of termination for breach under this Section 7.2.D, the non-breaching Party may elect to continue to receive any Services then being provided to such Party (but no new or additional Services may be ordered) from the other Party for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) Days and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of any doubt, (i) a Party's failure to meet Specifications, SLOs or SLAs with respect to a specific Service provided by such Party hereunder, (ii) any failure by SBC to perform its obligations under Article 6 of this Agreement and (iii) any failure by a Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement that are being disputed in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 12 shall not in and of itself be deemed to be a "substantial failure" of its obligations under this Section 7.2. 7.3 Survival.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in addition to the Articles, Sections, Schedules and Appendices specified in the immediately preceding sentence, in the event that this Agreement expires at the expiration of the Term and a Purchase Commitment Payment has been made, and such Purchase Commitment Payment or any portion thereof remains unused, SBC's rights to use any such remaining balance pursuant to Section 3.1.C, and Section 3.1.F.3 shall also survive until none of such Purchase Commitment Payment remains unused. 7.4 Effect of Termination. In the event that WilTel terminates this Agreement, SBC shall promptly pay to WilTel any undisputed outstanding invoiced amounts. Upon termination of this Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement, nothing herein shall relieve any Party of any Liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

Either Party may invoice the amount of any federal excise taxes or state or local sales taxes imposed on the other Party in connection with the provision of Services under this Agreement; provided that (i) such obligation is imposed by legislation or regulation and (ii) such obligation arises out of the use of Services provided under this Agreement. All such taxes shall be stated as separate items on a timely invoice and shall list the taxing jurisdiction imposing the tax. Installation, labor and other non-taxable charges must be separately stated. The invoicing Party agrees to remit taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities, as appropriate. Each Party agrees to honor properly prepared tax exemption certificates, which one Party may submit to the other Party, pursuant to the relevant tax provisions of the taxing jurisdictions. Neither Party shall be obligated to pay any amount otherwise collectible under this Section 8.3 that is invoiced after the later of (i) one hundred eighty (180) Days after the date that such Services are rendered and (ii) ninety (90) Days after the other Party's receipt of any statement or invoice for such amount; provided, however, that the invoice for any amount otherwise collectible under this Section must be received by billed Party within twenty-four (24) months after the date of the transaction giving rise to such tax. C. The invoicing Party agrees to pay, and to hold the other Party harmless from and against, any penalty, interest, additional tax, or other charge that may be levied or assessed as a result of the delay or failure of the invoicing Party, for any reason, to pay any tax or file any return or information required by Law or by this Agreement to be paid or filed by the invoicing Party. The invoicing Party agrees to pay and to hold the other Party harmless from and against any penalty or sanction assessed as a result of the invoicing Party doing business with any country subject to U.S. trade restrictions. 34 of 53
D. Upon SBC's request, the Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the basis and rates upon which WilTel shall pay any taxes or fees for which SBC is obligated to reimburse WilTel under this Agreement. If SBC determines that in its opinion any such taxes or fees are not payable, or should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than the full tax rate, WilTel shall make payment in accordance with such determinations and SBC shall be responsible for such determinations. If collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater amount of taxes than that so determined by SBC, WilTel shall promptly notify SBC. WilTel shall cooperate with SBC in contesting such determination, but SBC shall be responsible and shall reimburse WilTel for any tax, interest, or penalty in excess of its determination. If SBC desires to contest such collection, SBC shall promptly notify WilTel. If SBC determines that in its opinion it has reimbursed WilTel for sales or use taxes in excess of the amount which SBC is obligated to reimburse WilTel, SBC and WilTel shall consult with each other to determine the appropriate method of recovery of such excess reimbursements. WilTel shall credit any excess reimbursements against tax reimbursements or other payments due from SBC if and to the extent WilTel can make corresponding adjustments to its payments to the relevant tax authority. At SBC's request, WilTel shall timely file any claims for refund and any other documents required to recover any other excess reimbursements, and shall promptly remit to SBC all such refunds and interest received. E. If any taxing authority advises either Party that it intends to audit that Party with respect to any taxes for which the other Party is obligated to reimburse the Party being audited under this Agreement, the Party being audited shall (i) promptly so notify the other Party, (ii) afford the other Party an opportunity to participate on an equal basis with the audited Party in such audit with respect to such taxes and (iii) keep the other Party fully informed as to the progress of such audit. Each Party shall bear its own expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any additional tax, penalty or interest resulting from such audit shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section. F. The invoicing Party's failure to comply with the notification requirements of this Section 8.3 shall relieve the other Party of its responsibility to reimburse the invoicing Party for taxes only if the invoicing Party's failure materially prejudiced the other Party's ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes. G. In addition to its rights under Section 8.3.C with respect to any tax or tax controversy covered by this Section 8.3, either Party may contest, pursuant to applicable Law and Tariffs, and, at its own expense, any tax previously billed that it is ultimately obligated to pay. The contesting Party will be entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts that it had previously paid resulting from such a contest. The other Party will cooperate in any such contest, provided that all costs and expenses incurred in obtaining a refund or credit for the contesting Party shall be paid by the contesting Party. H. The invoicing Party shall reimburse the other Party for any tax benefits (for instance, refunds, including interest if paid by the applicable taxing authority) associated with taxes previously paid by the other Party. I. The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to any audit, tax controversy, tax refund matter, claim, action, or similar proceeding by a taxing authority or other governmental agency. The degree of cooperation contemplated by this Section 8.3 is to enable any resulting inquiry or controversy to be resolved expeditiously and includes, but is not limited to, assisting with responses to audit inquiries and producing documents and information. 35 of 53
J. WilTel will from time to time invoice SBC, and SBC agrees to pay for the "Net Amount," as defined in this Section 8.3.J of any USF payment obligations that WilTel is required or permitted by ordinance, statute, regulation or administrative pronouncement to collect from SBC as a result of the sale of Services to SBC (hereinafter, such amount referred to as the "USF Recovery Fee"). Such invoice shall list each applicable state or federal USF Recovery Fee as separate items, listing the jurisdiction imposing the USF payment obligations on WilTel. WilTel agrees to pay all Universal Service Fund payment obligations as required by Law. SBC's obligation to pay the USF Recovery Fee applies only to the extent that the SBC payments for Services, upon which the USF Recovery Fee is imposed, are included in the Net Amount that WilTel actually uses in determining its payment of its USF payment obligations. As used in this Section 8.3.J, the term "Net Amount" means the portion of the USF payment obligation that WilTel would not have otherwise incurred, but for the sale of Services pursuant to this Agreement, less any refunds or credits, if any, that WilTel could not have otherwise obtained, but for the sale of Services pursuant to this Agreement. Accordingly, SBC shall not be obligated to pay USF Recovery Fees to the extent they are not included in, or are deductible, or excludable from the amounts upon which WilTel is obligated to pay as its state or federal USF payment obligations. WilTel shall, within thirty (30) Days of a request by SBC, provide to SBC a statement by an officer of WilTel, stating the method used to compute SBC's USF Recovery Fee for the preceding twelve (12) month period during which the USF Recovery Fee was invoiced pursuant to this Section 8.3.J, as well as a computation of SBC's USF Recovery Fees invoiced during such period based on WilTel's USF payment obligations. SBC shall not be obligated to pay any such amount otherwise collectable under this Section 8.3.J, nor shall SBC be entitled to any refund otherwise payable under this Section 8.3.J, that is determined more than three (3) years after the date of the transaction giving rise to such obligation. Sections 8.3.E, 8.3.F and the first two sentences of Section 8.3.G shall not apply to this Section 8.3.J. The remaining subsections and portions of Section 8.3 shall continue to apply, and the terms "taxes" and/or "fees" as used herein shall include the USF Recovery Fees and USF payment obligations of this Section 8.3.J. The Parties shall have the right to audit, upon reasonable Notice and at a reasonable time and place, each other's computations of all amounts that are payable under this Section. Neither Party may exercise this right more frequently than once during any calendar year. ARTICLE 9. SBC RESPONSIBILITIES 9.1 SBC Responsibilities. A. SBC will not be relieved of any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder due to the fact that Service is ultimately provided to End Users. B. SBC will be solely responsible for End User solicitation, service requests, creditworthiness, SBC service, billing and collection, unless otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement. SBC remains responsible for its compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including payment responsibilities, without regard to SBC's ability to charge for Services used by End Users or to collect payment from End Users. C. Except as set forth in Section 15.3, SBC will be financially responsible for usage generated by each End User ANI activated by WilTel pursuant to a request by SBC until such ANI is presubscribed to another interexchange carrier or SBC requests that service be terminated. SBC may request WilTel to block an ANI upon the End User's failure to pay SBC, subject to SBC's prior certification to WilTel that it has given the End User any notice required by any applicable statute, rule or regulation. SBC will reimburse WilTel for reasonable expenses incurred to block an ANI. 36 of 53
D. SBC has sole responsibility for installation, testing and operation of its facilities, services and equipment ("SBC Facilities") other than those specifically provided by WilTel as part of the Service as described in a Service Order or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. ARTICLE 10. WILTEL RESPONSIBILITIES 10.1 Network Upgrade. WilTel hereby covenants and agrees that it shall keep the WilTel Network upgraded in the ordinary course of business, consistent with WilTel's past practices, with the most recent generic releases of system operating software that are generally available, unless operational issues, in WilTel's reasonable business judgment, require use of a different release. 10.2 Maintenance Capital. WilTel hereby further covenants and agrees that it shall expend maintenance capital in the ordinary course of business consistent with past business practices necessary to sustain its network operations and services. 10.3 [***] 10.4 End to End Services Ordered under WilTel's ACNA. Unless and to the extent SBC from time to time specifically instructs WilTel otherwise, SBC desires WilTel to manage all relationships with any Third Party Provider or Local Access Provider to the extent necessary to provide end-to-end service. SBC acknowledges that WilTel is unable to guarantee the level of service provided by any such Local Access Provider or Third Party Provider, although WilTel agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to manage these relationships in such a manner so as to ensure that the Transport Services meet the performance guarantees, if any, provided by such Local Access Provider or alternate interexchange service provider. 10.5 [***] 10.6 [***] Units Agreement. WilTel agrees to provide SBC installation and other services in connection with [***] units pursuant to the provisions set forth in Appendix H. ARTICLE 11. INVOICE, BILLING AND PAYMENT TERMS 11.1 Due Date and Invoice. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.5, all amounts stated on each monthly invoice are due and payable thirty (30) Days from the date on which a Party ("Paying Party") receives an invoice ("Due Date") from the other Party ("Billing Party"); provided, however, that the Paying Party may deduct from any amount due, any credit or remedy amount authorized under this Agreement. The Paying Party shall itemize the credit or remedies which are deducted from the payment. The Paying Party shall remit payment to the Billing Party at the remittance address. In the event that the Paying Party fails to make full payment the undisputed amounts to the proper address by the Due Date, the Paying Party shall also pay a late fee in the amount of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the unpaid balance per month or the maximum lawful rate under applicable state law which shall accrue from the Due Date. The Paying Party acknowledges and understands that all charges are computed exclusive of any applicable federal, state or local use, excise, valued added, gross receipts, sales and privilege taxes, tax or charge levied to support the Universal Fund contemplated by the Communications Act, taxes on Payphone Charges, duties, fees or similar liabilities (other than general income or property taxes imposed on the Billing Party), whether charged to or against the Billing Party ("Additional Charges"). Such Additional Charges are not classified as Service charges and shall be paid by the Paying Party in addition to all other charges provided for herein. Any late fees payable pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall not be counted towards the satisfaction of the Purchase Commitment. 37 of 53
11.2 Billing Periods. The Billing Party will bill the Paying Party monthly for Services provided hereunder. Charges for usage and all prorated MRCs (charges for monthly Service provided for less than a calendar month), installation and other NRCs shall be billed following the receipt of any such Services. Charges for all non-usage based MRCs for full months during which Service are to be provided shall be billed in advance. 11.3 Timeliness. The Billing Party will render invoices for Services not later than the [***] after the monthly billing cycle in which any usage is recorded.

If the Paying Party in good faith disputes any portion of an invoice it must pay the undisputed amount of the invoice on or before its Due Date and provide Notice to the Billing Party of the billing dispute within [***] thereafter. Such Notice must include documentation substantiating the dispute. The Paying Party's failure to notify the Billing Party of a dispute shall be deemed to be the Paying Party's acceptance of such charges. The Parties will make a good faith effort to resolve billing disputes expeditiously. If the Paying Party has already made payment of a disputed charge and a dispute is resolved in favor of the Paying Party, the Paying Party shall receive a credit on its next invoice for the amount determined to be due, including interest in the disputed amount of [***] per month from the date the Paying Party paid the disputed amount. If the dispute is resolved in favor of the Billing Party, the Paying Party shall immediately pay the resolved amount, to the extent not already paid, plus interest on such amount at the rate of [***] per month from the Due Date. Any interest payments payable pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall not be counted towards the satisfaction of the Purchase Commitment. 11.6 Adjustments.

The provisions of this Article 19 shall survive two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. ARTICLE 20. PUBLICITY 20.1 Publicity.

that the use of the On-Net Transport Services by SBC as the IP Indemnified Party, or the Platform Services by WilTel as the IP Indemnified Party, as the case may be, infringes any United States trade secret, patent, copyright or other proprietary right of any Third Party. The indemnification obligations hereunder shall not apply any claim arising out of or relating to: (i) infringement of any claim in a patent, which is comprised of a number of elements which include both the elements of the IP Indemnifying Party's Services and other elements not provided by the IP Indemnifying Party, where such elements not provided by the IP Indemnifying Party produce the infringement by providing the element(s) of novelty in such patent claim, or (ii) any allegedly infringing activity by the IP Indemnified Party based on the use of the On-Net Transport Services or the Platform Services, as the case may be, after the IP Indemnifying Party has notified the IP Indemnified Party of such allegations thereof and the IP Indemnifying Party has requested that the IP Indemnified Party use an identified non-infringing substitute.

D. The Parties agree that the provisions of Sections 15.1.C, 15.2, 16.1.C and 16.1.D shall apply to the indemnity under this Section 21.1. 21.2 Intellectual Property Rights.

C-10
IX. GENERAL PROVISIONS: A. Integration: This Settlement Agreement, together with the other Effective Date Documents, contains the entire agreement pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, representations, agreements and understandings of the Parties and Leucadia with respect to such subject matter (including the Alliance Agreements), whether written or oral. The Parties and Leucadia acknowledge that they have not relied on any promise, representation or warranty, expressed or implied, not contained in or contemplated by this Settlement Agreement or the other Effective Date Documents. B. Challenges: The Parties and Leucadia each agree that they will not seek to challenge or to have determined invalid, void or unenforceable any provision of this Settlement Agreement or the Settlement Agreement itself. The Parties and Leucadia understand that this Settlement Agreement contains the relinquishment of legal rights and each has, as each has deemed appropriate, sought the advice of legal counsel, which each of the Parties and Leucadia has encouraged the other to seek. Further, the Parties and Leucadia agree that none of them has reposed such trust or confidence in the other Party or Leucadia so as to create a fiduciary, agency or confidential relationship. C. Non-Waiver: Except as otherwise specified in this Settlement Agreement, no amendment of or waiver of the performance of any provision of this Settlement Agreement and no consent to any default under this Settlement Agreement shall be effective unless the same is in writing and properly executed by or on behalf of the Party or Leucadia against whom such waiver, amendment or consent is claimed. Waiver by either Party or Leucadia of any default by the other Party or Leucadia shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default. Failure of a Party or Leucadia to insist on performance of any term or condition of this Settlement Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall not be construed as a continuing or future waiver of such term, condition, right or privilege. No course of dealing or failure of any Party or Leucadia to strictly enforce any term, right or condition of this Settlement Agreement in any instance shall be construed as a general waiver or relinquishment of such term, right or condition. D. No Admission: This Settlement Agreement is the result of good faith negotiations and compromise. The agreements and the Releases contained in this Settlement Agreement affect the Claims which are denied and contested, and nothing set forth herein shall be construed as an admission by any Party or Leucadia hereto of any liability of any kind to the other, or to any other Person. C-11
E. Additional Actions: Each of the Parties and Leucadia covenants and agrees, severally and for itself and its Affiliates only, to take additional actions that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to fully effectuate the terms, intent and conditions of this Settlement Agreement.

Binding Nature: This Settlement Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and Leucadia and shall be binding upon the Parties and Leucadia and their respective successors and permitted assigns. G. Equitable Relief: Each Party and Leucadia acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Settlement Agreement by another Party or Leucadia, as the case may be, and that the non-breaching Party or Parties or Leucadia will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance for any such breach. Such remedies are not to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Settlement Agreement, but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. H. No Drafting Presumption: The Parties and Leucadia hereto have had the opportunity to be represented by counsel in their negotiations of the terms of this Settlement Agreement. This Settlement Agreement will be deemed to have been drafted jointly by the Parties and Leucadia and therefore no provision of this Settlement Agreement shall be construed against any Party or Leucadia on the theory that such Party or Leucadia drafted such provision. I. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction: This Settlement Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Settlement Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in a state court or any federal court sitting in New York County, the State of New York. The Parties and Leucadia each hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such state or federal court sitting in New York County, the State of New York for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Settlement Agreement brought by any Party or Leucadia and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such action or proceeding is improper, or that this Settlement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. C-12
J. Validity of Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures: This Settlement Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts and sent via facsimile to the other Party or Leucadia, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be taken to be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same document.
