Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. As previously disclosed in its Form 8-K dated June 17, 2005, Leucadia National Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with VarTec Telecom, Inc. and subsidiaries of VarTec (collectively, the "VarTec Companies"), debtors-in-possession under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Agreement was subject to approval of the bankruptcy court overseeing the VarTec Companies' bankruptcy. In an auction held on July 25, 2005, the contract to purchase the assets of the VarTec Companies was awarded to another party. At a hearing held on July 27, 2005, the bankruptcy court approved the results of the auction and authorized the VarTec Companies to consummate the sale with the party that won the auction. As a result, pursuant to bankruptcy court approved terms, the previously announced Agreement was terminated and the Company will be entitled to a $2 million termination fee, payable in the third quarter of 2005. 2
