Exhibit 99.1 August 8, 2005 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Laura Ulbrandt (212) 460-1900 LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SIX MONTH 2005 RESULTS Leucadia National Corporation (LUK - NYSE) today announced its operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2005. In June 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment that reduced the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and credited income tax expense by $1,110,000,000. Although this adjustment significantly increases reported net income for the period and shareholders' equity as of June 30, 2005, it is not a cash gain, and it does not represent any immediate income tax savings. The adjustment results from the Company's conclusion that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the net deferred tax asset, and is required to be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles. Net income was $1,273,724,000 (including the $1,110,000,000 adjustment referred to above) or $11.09 per diluted common share for the six month period ended June 30, 2005 compared to net income of $22,023,000 or $.21 per diluted common share for the six month period ended June 30, 2004. Net income per share included income of $.47 for the 2005 period and a loss of $.02 for the 2004 period related to discontinued operations. For more information on the adjustment described above and the Company's results of operations for the first half of 2005, please see the Company's Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2005, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
