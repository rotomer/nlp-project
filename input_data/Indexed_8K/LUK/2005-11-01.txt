If the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital set forth on the schedule accompanying the Month End Balance Sheet exceeds $26 million, the Cash Purchase Price payable to the Seller at the Closing shall be increased by an amount equal to such surplus. 13
SECTION 3.2. Post-Closing Determination. Within 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Measurement Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet").

The calculation of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital shall be examined by the Buyer who shall, not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, deliver a report thereon (the "Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report") to the Seller. The Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report shall list those items included in the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital, if any, to which the Buyer takes exception and the Buyer's proposed adjustment. If the Buyer fails to deliver to the Seller the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report within 30 calendar days following receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3. If the Seller does not give the Buyer notice of its objections to the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report within 30 calendar days following receipt of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet as adjusted by the Buyer in the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3. If the Seller gives the Buyer notice of its objections to the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital Report, and if the Seller and the Buyer are unable, within 15 calendar days after receipt by the Buyer of the notice from the Seller of objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such disputed exceptions will be referred to Deloitte & Touche LLP or another firm of independent certified public accountants (the "Independent Accounting Firm") mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Buyer. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within 60 days following its selection, deliver to the Seller and the Buyer a written report determining such disputed exceptions, and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the parties thereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm acting under this Section 3.2 shall be apportioned between the Buyer and the Seller based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm as the aggregate disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accounting Firm. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery and timing of receipt of any document sent by the parties pursuant to this Section 3 shall be governed by the provisions set forth in Section 13.5 - "Notices." 14

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries' operations. SECTION 7.2. Consents and Approvals. Leucadia and the Seller shall, and shall cause each of the Company and its Subsidiaries to (a) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Entities, and of all other Persons, required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Seller and Leucadia of this Agreement, and the Buyer and Level 3 shall cooperate with the Seller and Leucadia in obtaining such consents and (b) cooperate with the Buyer and Level 3 in preparing and filing all documents required to be submitted by the Buyer or Level 3 to any Governmental Entity, in connection with such transactions and in obtaining any governmental consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals which may be required to be obtained by the Buyer or Level 3 in connection with such transactions (which assistance and cooperation shall include, without limitation, timely furnishing to the Buyer and Level 3 all information concerning Leucadia, the Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries that counsel to the Buyer determines is required to be included in such documents). SECTION 7.3. Access to Properties and Records. Leucadia and the Seller shall cause each of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to afford to the Buyer and Level 3, and to the accountants, counsel and representatives of the Buyer and Level 3, reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12) to all properties, books, contracts, commitments and files and records (but limited with respect to Tax Returns and 41
correspondence with accountants to these portions of Tax Returns and correspondence with accountants that relate to the Company and its Retained Subsidiaries and to the extent reasonably necessary to evaluate the purchase of the Membership Units) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to the Buyer and Level 3 all other information concerning the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries, properties and personnel as the Buyer and Level 3 may reasonably request to evaluate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that neither Leucadia nor the Seller shall be required to provide access to any such properties, personnel or information to the extent relating exclusively to the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities. Leucadia and the Seller also shall cause each of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to afford to the Buyer and Level 3 reasonable access to its assets and operations throughout the period prior to the Closing Date to evaluate the transactions contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise agreed to by Leucadia and the Seller, all information provided to Buyer and Level 3 and their advisors and representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that such obligation will terminate upon the Closing with respect to information relating to the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries (except, if the Buyer has not exercised the Benefit Plan Substitution Right pursuant to Section 2.2(b), in connection with Level 3's and the Buyer's investigation of the Transferred Benefit Plans in accordance with Section 7.16). No investigation or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall qualify any representation or warranty of Leucadia or the Seller or the conditions to the obligations of the Buyer or Level 3. SECTION 7.4. Pre-Closing Transfers. On or prior to the Closing, Leucadia and the Seller shall cause the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to transfer to one or more entities directly or indirectly wholly owned by Leucadia (other than the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries) (the "Transferee") all of the right, title and interest of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries in and to the Excluded Assets. Such transfer shall be on an "as is, where is" basis, and the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries will make no representations or warranties, either express or implied, to the Transferee with respect to the Excluded Assets and the Transferee will have no recourse against the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries with respect to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. In addition, Leucadia and the Seller shall cause the Transferee to assume and to pay, perform, settle and discharge when due all obligations with respect to the Excluded Liabilities. Furthermore, to the extent that any of the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities require the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to perform obligations thereunder (including any guarantees), Leucadia and the Seller shall, prior to the Closing, obtain from the other parties thereto the written unconditional release of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries from all obligations (including any guarantees) and liabilities under such contracts and provide any required notices to any Person or shall otherwise indemnify the Buyer and Level 3 with respect thereto without limitation pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.3(b)(ii) and (iii) hereof. In connection with obtaining the release of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries from the Company's Credit Documents, the Company may borrow funds from Leucadia or an Affiliate of Leucadia and, subject to Section 7.15(a), such inter-company loans will be repaid by the Company at or prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, such transfer of the Excluded Assets and assumption of the Excluded Liabilities and release or indemnification of the Company's and the Retained Subsidiaries' obligations thereunder (including any guarantees) are collectively referred to as the "Pre-Closing Transfers." Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to transferring the capital stock, membership units or other ownership interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries to the Transferee, Leucadia and the Seller shall cause the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries to transfer to the Company or a Retained Subsidiary all of the right, title and interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries in and to any of the assets and rights primarily used in the Businesses. Leucadia and the Seller shall assume full liability for any and all Taxes that result from the Pre-Closing Transfers to the extent in excess of any Tax (except liability for any Income Tax) reflected in the determination of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital. 42
SECTION 7.5. Registration Statement and Level 3 Commission Filing Requirements. Leucadia and the Seller shall and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) prepare and timely deliver to the Buyer, such that the Buyer can meet any Commission filing deadlines with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, audited GAAP financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2004 and, upon the completion thereof, the year ended December 31, 2005, as well as unaudited quarterly financials of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the financial statements for 2006 quarterly periods ending prior to the Closing, for inclusion in the Registration Statement or to meet Level 3's Commission filing requirements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cause Leucadia's independent public accountants to perform the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of financial information as described in SAS 100, Interim Financial Information with respect to the unaudited financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the financial statements for 2006 quarterly periods ending prior to the Closing and (iii) to the extent required by the Company's independent public accountants, cooperate with Level 3 and the Company to obtain the consent of the Company's independent public accountants, when required, with respect to the 2004 and 2005 audited financial statements so that such audited financial statements can, if required, be included in the Registration Statement or other Commission reports required to filed with or furnished to the Commission by Level 3 with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Level 3 and the Buyer acknowledge that if the Closing has occurred, timely delivery of certain items required under this Section 7.5 will require the cooperation and efforts of Level 3 and the Buyer to the same extent as Leucadia and the Seller. SECTION 7.6. Negotiations. From and after the date hereof and until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12 hereof, Leucadia and the Seller shall not, and shall cause any Persons acting on behalf of Leucadia, the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries not to encourage, solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person or group (other than the Buyer or its representatives) concerning any merger, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock, membership units or partnership interests or similar transaction involving the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries (other than with respect to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities). SECTION 7.7. Certain Real Estate Matters. Prior to the Closing, Leucadia and the Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) renew the Leases set forth on Schedule 7.7(a), (ii) allow the Leases set forth on Schedule 7.7(b) to expire in accordance with their terms and (iii) terminate the intercompany leases set forth on Schedule 7.7(c), in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), with no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, the Retained Subsidiaries, the Buyer or Level 3, except as therein provided. 43
SECTION 7.8. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Leucadia and the Seller will use and shall cause each of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Leucadia and the Seller shall execute the Registration Rights Agreement on the Closing Date and Leucadia and the Seller shall cause the Company and WilTel Technology Center, LLC to execute the Lease Agreement on the Closing Date. SECTION 7.9. Notice of Breach. Through the Closing Date, Leucadia and the Seller shall (a) promptly give written notice with particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of Leucadia or the Seller contained in this Agreement and (b) promptly notify Level 3 upon having knowledge of the announced intention of any of the suppliers or customers listed on Schedule 5.22(a) and Schedule 5.22(b), respectively, to cancel, terminate or materially reduce its relationship with the Company or any Retained Subsidiary as such relationship exists on the date hereof. No notification pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall qualify any representation or warranty of Leucadia or the Seller or the conditions to the obligations of the Buyer or Level 3. SECTION 7.10. Stock Certificate Legend. The certificates evidencing the Shares will bear substantially the following legend reflecting the foregoing restrictions on the transfer of such Shares: "The securities evidenced hereby have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be transferred except pursuant to an effective registration under the Act or in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Level 3 Communications, Inc. qualifies as an exempt transaction under the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such securities are also subject to the agreements, covenants and restrictions in regard to the transfer of such securities as provided in that certain Registration Rights and Transfer Restriction Agreement, dated as of [the Closing Date], among Level 3 Communications, Inc., Leucadia National Corporation and Baldwin Enterprises, Inc., a copy of which Registration Rights and Transfer Restriction Agreement is on file at the office of the Secretary of Level 3 Communications, Inc." SECTION 7.11. Non-Solicitation. (a) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Initial Restricted Period"), each of the Seller and Leucadia shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, induce or solicit for employment or engagement as a consultant, or 44
hire or engage as a consultant, any Covered Employee of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries, provided, that neither (i) generalized searches through media advertisement, employment firms or otherwise that are not directed to such personnel nor (ii) soliciting or hiring such individuals following their termination of employment or notification of termination by the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries shall constitute a violation of the foregoing; provided, such hiring occurs after the actual date of termination. (b) During the period commencing on the day after the 12-month anniversary of this Agreement and ending on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Subsequent Restricted Period"), each of the Seller and Leucadia shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, induce or solicit for employment or engagement as a consultant, any Covered Employee of the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries, provided, that neither (i) generalized searches through media advertisement, employment firms or otherwise that are not directed to such personnel nor (ii) soliciting such individuals following their termination of employment or notification of termination by the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries shall constitute a violation of the foregoing. (c) The parties agree that a monetary remedy for a breach of the agreements set forth in Sections 7.11(a) and (b) hereof will be inadequate and impracticable and further agree that such a breach would cause Level 3 and the Buyer irreparable harm, and that Level 3 and the Buyer shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages. In the event of such a breach, Leucadia and the Seller agree that Level 3 and the Buyer shall be entitled to such injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions as a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine. (d) If any provision of this Section 7.11 is invalid in part, it shall be curtailed, as to time, location or scope, to the minimum extent required for its validity under the laws of the United States and shall be binding and enforceable with respect to the Seller and Leucadia as so curtailed. SECTION 7.12. Employees and Employee Benefits. (a) Certain current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including certain predecessor companies) participate in a qualified defined benefit pension plan known as the WilTel Communications, LLC Pension Plan (the "Retirement Plan"). Prior to the Closing Date, Leucadia and the Seller shall take all necessary and appropriate action to: (i) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to amend or revise the Retirement Plan so that no further benefits will be accrued by their employees under such plan on or after the Closing Date, (ii) assume the sponsorship of the Retirement Plan and the related obligations and liabilities thereunder accrued in respect of the eligible employees prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease to sponsor and maintain the Retirement Plan as of the date such sponsorship is assumed by Leucadia and the Seller; provided, however, that the covenants of the Seller set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 7.12(a) shall be of no further force and effect upon the exercise by the Buyer of its Benefit Plan Substitution Right in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to implement a qualified defined benefit pension plan for their employees on or after the Closing Date. 45
(b) Certain current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan known as the WilTel Communications, LLC Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). Prior to the Closing Date, Leucadia and the Seller shall take all necessary and appropriate action to: (i) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to amend or revise the Deferred Compensation Plan so that no further benefits will be accrued by their employees under such plan on or after the Closing Date, (ii) assume the sponsorship of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the related obligations and liabilities thereunder accrued in respect of the eligible employees prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease to sponsor and maintain the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the date such sponsorship is assumed by Leucadia and the Seller; provided, however, that the covenants of the Seller set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 7.12(b) shall be of no further force and effect upon the exercise by the Buyer of its Benefit Plan Substitution Right in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to implement a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for their employees on or after the Closing Date. (c) Within three days after the date hereof, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a list dated as of October 28, 2005 containing the name, position, starting employment date, current annual salary, bonus and commissions in 2004 of each current employee of either of the Company or its Retained Subsidiaries. (d) No provision of this Section 7.12 shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) and no provision of this Section 7.12 shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee plan or arrangement which may be established or maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Closing Date any such plans or arrangements of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. SECTION 7.13. Tax Matters. (a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all recording charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer and the parties shall cooperate in the filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and charges. (b) (i) The Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent that such Tax Returns are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, taking into account all valid extensions of time to file such returns. The Seller shall also prepare and file or cause to be prepared and 46
filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent such Tax Returns relate to Income Taxes, irrespective of when due. (ii) The Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent that such Tax Returns relate to Taxes other than Income Taxes and are required to be filed after the Closing Date, taking into account all valid extensions of time to file such returns. (iii) The Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, any Taxes due in respect of any such Tax Returns in excess of any Taxes reflected in the determination of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital, which shall be paid by the Company, but such limitation shall have no application to Income Taxes. In the case of Tax Returns prepared by the Buyer pursuant to clause (ii), the Buyer shall cooperate with and shall follow the direction of the Seller in the preparation of such Tax Returns and the Seller shall pay over to the Buyer the amount of any Tax owing under such Tax Return to be paid by the Seller under this Section 7.13(b) within three days of receiving notice from the Buyer of such amount, which notice shall be delivered not be less than seven days prior to the due date of such return; provided, however, that there is at least substantial authority for the positions required to be taken on such Tax Returns. The Tax Returns prepared pursuant to the first sentence of clause (i) and clause (ii) shall be prepared consistent with past practice unless there shall be no reasonable basis therefor and unless the failure to prepare such returns in such a manner would not reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Company, the Retained Subsidiaries or the Buyer after the Closing. (c) The Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when due all Straddle Tax Returns and shall cause the Company to pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon; provided, however, that the Seller shall pay over to the Buyer within three days of receiving notice from the Buyer of such amount, which notice shall be delivered not less than seven days prior to the due date of such Straddle Tax Return for the portion of any such Tax that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, but only to the extent in excess of any Taxes reflected in the determination of the Actual Adjusted Net Working Capital, which shall be paid by the Company. The Seller will furnish to the Buyer all information and records reasonably requested by the Buyer for use in preparation of any Straddle Tax Return. The Buyer shall furnish the Seller with a completed draft of any Straddle Tax Return for the Seller to review and comment upon no later that 20 days before the Buyer files any such return or such shorter period that may be practical in the circumstances, provided that reasonably adequate time under the circumstances is provided to the Seller for such review. The Buyer shall not file any such Straddle Tax Return without the Seller's consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (d) In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) Property Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than Property Taxes) for the portion of the Straddle Period that constitutes a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If necessary because the assets were reported to the tax authorities on a combined basis (i.e., Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2005), the Property Taxes shall be allocated by the Buyer between the assets acquired in this transaction and the Buyer's remaining assets in accordance with the Buyer's reasonable asset allocation practice. If the Buyer's allocation is disputed by the Seller, then the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. 47
(e) If a Tax authority commences any audit, examination, litigation or otherwise makes any claim or proposes any adjustment that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than an Straddle Period) (collectively, a "Tax Proceeding"), then the Buyer shall promptly furnish written notice to the Seller of such Tax Proceeding. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Seller from any liability which it may have on account of this indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Seller is prejudiced thereby. The Seller shall have the shorter of (i) 45 days after receipt of such notice or (ii) 15 days less than the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax authority is required, but in no event shall the Seller have less than 15 days, to decide whether to undertake, conduct and control (through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense) the response to such Tax Proceeding and the settlement or defense thereof, and the Buyer shall fully cooperate with Seller in connection therewith including, but not limited to, providing powers of attorney authorizing Leucadia (or its designee) to control and take action in connection with any such Taxes. The Seller shall permit the Buyer to participate in such response, settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the Buyer (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by Buyer). If any settlement materially adversely affects any Subsidiary in a Post-Closing Tax Period, the Seller shall not pay or settle any such claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If within the shorter of (x) 45 days after the receipt of the Buyer's notice of a Tax Proceeding or (y) 20 days less than the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax authority is required (but in no event less than 20 days), the Seller does not notify the Buyer that the Seller elects (at its cost and expense) to undertake the defense thereof, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest such claim in good faith, then the Buyer shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Tax Proceeding and the Buyer shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity for such Tax Proceeding under this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall be indemnified by the Seller for the Buyer's reasonable costs, including attorneys' and consultants' fees in defending and settling such proceedings; provided, however, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries not to, pay or settle any such Tax Proceedings without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (f) If a Tax authority commences any audit, examination, litigation, or otherwise makes any claim or proposes any adjustment that relates to a Straddle Period (collectively, a "Straddle Period Tax Proceeding"), then the Buyer shall promptly furnish written notice to the Seller of such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Seller from any liability which it may have on account of this indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Seller is prejudiced thereby. The Buyer shall undertake, conduct and control (through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense) the response to such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding and the settlement or defense thereof. The Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in connection therewith, and the Buyer shall permit the Seller to participate in such response, settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the Seller (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by Seller). To the extent any settlement adversely affects the Seller in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the 48
Buyer shall not pay or settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If within the shorter of (i) 45 days after the receipt of the Buyer's notice of a Straddle Period Tax Proceeding or (ii) 15 days less than the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax authority is required (but in no event less than 15 days), the Buyer fails to contest such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Buyer's property, then the Seller shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding and the Seller shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity for such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding under this Agreement; provided, however, the Seller shall not pay or settle any such Straddle Period Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (g) The Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, carry back any loss, credit or other Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (h) All tax sharing, indemnity or allocation agreements or arrangements among the Company and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and Seller, Leucadia or their Affiliates on the other hand shall terminate at or prior to the Closing and the parties thereto shall have no further obligation thereunder. (i) Level 3 and the Buyer, on the one hand, and Leucadia and the Seller, on the other hand, will cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns required under this Agreement and will provide to each other access, at any reasonable time and from time to time, at the business location at which the books and records are maintained, after the Closing Date, to such Tax data relating to the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries as Leucadia and the Seller or Level 3 and the Buyer, as the case may be, may from time to time reasonably request. SECTION 7.14. Name. Promptly after the Closing, Leucadia and the Seller shall cause WilTel Aircraft Leasing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and WilTel Technology Center, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, to change their names to such names that do not include "WilTel" and to otherwise cease using such name in its operations.

The Indemnitor agrees to 56
defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnitee against any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding at its sole cost and expense subject to the provisions of this Section 9. The Indemnitor shall have the sole power to direct and control the defense of any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding. The Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of the Indemnitee's choice.

In the event of a failure of the Indemnitee to provide cooperation as required under this Section 9.4, the Indemnitor's obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be reduced to the extent of the Losses with respect to which the Indemnitor's ability to defend against the action, investigation, claim or proceeding underlying such indemnification obligation has been prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding unless (x) such compromise or settlement is on exclusively monetary terms and shall be paid entirely by the Indemnitor (subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(b)(i) and (ii) and 9.3(b)(i) and (ii), which shall be controlling) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release in such compromise or settlement or (y) the Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to the terms of such compromise or settlement, which consent shall not unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee fails to consent thereto, the Indemnitor's liability with respect to such matter shall not exceed the proposed settlement amount. If the Indemnitor fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to make any compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnitor subject to the provisions of this Section 9, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding. SECTION 9.5. Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, except for claims relating to fraud or for injunctive relief, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Section 9.

Subject to Section 2.6 hereof, the Company shall (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Investors, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Investors or any such underwriter, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's accountants and auditors, to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Investors or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the underwritten offering, (iii) as may be reasonably requested, cause the Company's officers and employees to participate in investor presentations to prospective investors and analysts, 8
including via "road shows," and (iv) generally accommodate any participating underwriter's reasonable requests relating to its due diligence efforts; provided, however, that the Investors shall only be entitled to effect up to a total of three (3) underwritten offerings of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement; provided, further, however, that no such offering pursuant to Section 2.2.1 hereof shall be made by the Holder: (A) on more than one occasion during any period of sixty (60) consecutive days after any other such offering of Registrable Securities in accordance with this Section 2.2 was consummated; (B) within sixty (60) days of the consummation of an offering of Registrable Securities in which the Investors were offered the opportunity to participate pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, provided that all the Registrable Securities requested by the Investors to be so registered were registered for sale in such offering; and (C) unless the Investors will offer for sale at least thirty million (30,000,000) shares of Common Stock or the equivalent number of shares of Registrable Securities or, with respect to the third underwritten offering, at least forty million (40,000,000) shares of Common Stock or the equivalent number of shares of Registrable Securities. (1) 2.2.5 Effective Registration Statement. For purposes of determining an Investor's right to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement in an underwritten offering referred to in Section 2.2.1 hereof, an offering of such nature shall not be deemed to have been effected unless (A) a registration statement with respect thereto has become effective and remained in effect for the relevant period set forth in Section 2.4.1(b) hereof (provided, however, that a registration which does not become effective solely by reason of the refusal of all of the Investors to proceed with the offering or the refusal by the Company to proceed based upon the written opinion of outside counsel to the lead underwriter delivered to and reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that proceeding is inappropriate as a legal matter for a reason relating to circumstances of all of the Investors shall be deemed to have been effected), (B) after it has become effective, such registration has not become subject to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court for any reason, other than solely by reason of some act or omission by the Investors with respect thereto, or such stop order, injunction or other order has been lifted so as to permit such offering and sale of Registrable Securities, and (C) the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are satisfied or any failure to satisfy such conditions was solely by reason of some act or omission by the Investors. 2.2.6 Underwriting Agreements. If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering by the Investors to be conducted pursuant to Section 2.2.1 hereof, the Company will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be in customary form for offerings of this type and acceptable to the Investors (it being agreed that the - -------------------- (1) To the extent the Company exercises its Substitution Rights, these thresholds will be reduced proportionately. 9
Company's prior underwriting agreements to the extent applicable for offerings of this type will be considered in determining what is customary), whose acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, to contain such representations and warranties by the Company and such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of this type, including, without limitation, representations and indemnities by the Company and other customary indemnifications. The Investors will cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement and will give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the Company regarding the form thereof. 2.2.7 Holdback Agreement. Unless the managing underwriter otherwise agrees, each of the Company and the Investors agree (and the Company agrees, in connection with any underwritten registration, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to agree) not to effect any public sale or private offer or distribution of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents during such time period after the pricing of any underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 2.2 as may reasonably be requested by the managing underwriter (such period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days); provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) if applicable, any offering made as part of such underwritten registration, (ii) up to $100 million of 3(a)(9) offerings and (iii) other exceptions customary for offerings of this type (it being agreed that the Company's prior underwriting agreements to the extent applicable for offerings of this type will be considered in determining what is customary). 2.2.8 Selection of Underwriters. In an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to this Section 2.2, the Notifying Investors shall select the investment banking firm or firms to manage the underwritten offering; provided, however, that such selection shall be subject to the consent of the Company; provided, further, that the Company agrees that any selection of Jefferies & Company, Inc. shall be acceptable. 2.2.9 Participation in Underwritten Offerings. Neither an Investor nor any other Person may participate in any underwritten offering in which Registrable Securities are to be offered pursuant to this Section 2.2 unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, by the Company and the Investors to be included in such underwritten offering and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents (other than powers of attorney) reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 2.3 Piggyback Underwritten Offerings. 2.3.1 Right to Piggyback. In the event that the Company shall seek to undertake an underwritten public offering of registered shares of Common Stock for cash (whether for the account of the Company or the account of any securityholder of the Company), except in the case of an offering registered on Form S-4 or S-8 (or any successor form) for the registration of securities to be 10
offered in a transaction of the type referred to in Rule 145 or to be offered to employees of and/or consultants to the Company or subsidiaries thereof, the Company shall first give written notice thereof (the "Company Notice") to each Investor, which Company Notice shall be given not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated initiation of such underwritten offering and shall offer the Investors the opportunity to include any or all of its Registrable Securities in such underwritten offering, subject to the limitations contained in Section 2.3.3 hereof, unless the managing underwriter for such underwritten public offering has advised the Company that the shares to be offered by the Company in such offering constitute the Maximum Offering Size, in which case, the Company shall give the Investors written notice to this effect prior to the initiation of such offering in lieu of the Company Notice and each Investor shall not have the right to include its Registrable Securities in such offering. 2.3.2 Notice of Participation in Piggyback Offerings. Each Investor shall advise the Company in writing within five (5) Business Days after the date of receipt of the Company Notice, specifying the number of Registrable Securities, if any, the Investor seeks to include in such underwritten offering. The Company shall thereupon include in such underwritten offering the number of Registrable Securities so requested by such Investor to be included, subject to Section 2.3.3 hereof, and shall use reasonable best efforts to effect registration of such Registrable Securities under the Securities Act; provided, however, that the Company may at any time withdraw or cease proceeding with any such underwritten offering of such Investor's Registrable Securities if it shall at the same time withdraw or cease proceeding with the underwritten offering of all other shares of Common Stock originally proposed to be registered. 2.3.3 Priority on Piggyback Offerings. If the managing underwriter of the underwritten offering pursuant to which Registrable Securities are included pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall advise the Company and the Investors in writing that, in its view, the number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering (including securities to be sold by the Company or by other Persons not holding Registrable Securities) exceeds the Maximum Offering Size, the Company will include in such underwritten offering, to the extent of the number which the Company is so advised can be sold in such underwritten offering, (i) first, securities of the Company that the Company proposes to sell, (ii) second, Registrable Securities held by the Investors, and (iii) third, securities of the Company held by other Persons having registration rights proposed to be included in such registration statement, allocated, if necessary, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares proposed to be included in such registration by such Investors and/or such other Persons, as applicable. 2.3.4 Expenses. The Company shall be liable for and pay all of Registration Expenses in connection with any underwritten offering in which the Investors have the opportunity to participate pursuant to this Section 2.3; provided, however, that in any underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 2.3 the Investors shall pay any underwriting commissions and discounts incurred pursuant to and in connection with any underwritten offering by such Investor and the other fees and expenses in excess of the thresholds set forth in the definition of "Registration Expenses." 11
2.3.5 Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Company will not grant to any other Person or allow the exercise by any other Person rights to piggyback or participate in registered underwritten offerings of shares of Common Stock for cash in priority to the rights granted to the Investors in this Section 2.3 or that would impair the rights of the Investors under this Agreement (including with respect to the timing of any underwritten offering initiated by the Investors pursuant hereto). 2.4 Registration Procedures. 2.4.1 Actions to be taken by the Company. If and when the Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided herein, the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible, but subject to the provisions of Section 2.6 hereof: (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on any appropriate form under the Securities Act with respect to such Registrable Securities and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable under the circumstances and to remain effective for the period set forth in subparagraph (b) below; (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement until the earlier of such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of distribution thereof or, in the case of the Shelf Registration Statement, the expiration of the period set forth in Section 2.1 hereof; (c) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and the underwriters of the securities being registered such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), any documents incorporated by reference therein and such other documents as such seller or underwriters may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller or the sale of such securities by such underwriters (it being understood that, subject to Section 2.6 hereof and the requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, the Company consents to the use of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each seller and the underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement of which such prospectus, amendment or supplement is a part); 12
(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the managing underwriter reasonably requests (or, in the event the registration statement does not relate to an underwritten offering, as the holders of a majority of such Registrable Securities may reasonably request); use its reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period in which such registration statement is required to be kept effective and take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the Investor and such underwriter to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by the Investor; and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the Investor to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by the Investor in such jurisdictions (provided, however, that the Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph or (B) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction); (e) promptly notify each seller and each underwriter and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in writing (i) when the registration statement, a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed and, with respect to a registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of the issuance by any state securities or other regulatory authority of any order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities under state securities or "blue sky" laws or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and (iii) of the happening of any event which makes any statement made in a registration statement or related prospectus untrue or which requires the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or documents so that in either event they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC and furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (f) if requested by the managing underwriter or any seller promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriter or any seller reasonably requests to be included therein, including, without limitation, with respect to the Registrable Securities being sold by 13

(n) notify each of the sellers promptly of any request by the SEC for the amending or supplementing of such registration statement or prospectus or for additional information; (o) prepare and file with the SEC promptly any amendments or supplements to such registration statement or prospectus which, in the opinion of counsel for the Company or the managing underwriter, is required in connection with the distribution of the Registrable Securities; (p) enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements in the managing underwriter's customary form) as are customary in connection with an underwritten registration; and (q) advise each seller, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order should be issued. 2.4.2 Information to be Provided by the Investors. The Investors shall furnish the Company such information regarding such Investor and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with the Company's performance of its obligations hereunder. 2.5 Standstill Agreement; Restrictions on Transfer. 2.5.1 Standstill. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Holder nor any of its Affiliates shall (i) until June 22, 2006, increase its Beneficial Ownership of the Common Stock and (ii) thereafter until the third anniversary of the date hereof, increase its Beneficial Ownership above 15% (fifteen percent) of the Company's total outstanding Common Stock without the prior written consent of the Board, provided, however, that the foregoing limitation set forth in clause (ii) shall terminate and be of no further force and effect from and after the time, if ever, that, the Holder's and any of its Affiliates Beneficial Ownership of the Common Stock falls below 5% (five percent) of the Company's total outstanding Common Stock. 2.5.2 Prohibitions during Transfer Period. Prior to the Effective Date, neither the Holder nor its Affiliates shall Transfer any shares of Common Stock. Other than as set forth below, until the first to occur of (A) 150 days following the Effective Date and (B) June 22, 2006 (the "Transfer Period"), the Holder and its Affiliates shall not Transfer in the aggregate on any given day (a "Transfer Date") such number of shares of Common Stock that exceeds (i) the product of (x) three million (3,000,000) shares of Common Stock and (y) the number of trading days in the period from and including the Closing Date to and including the Transfer Date less (ii) the aggregate number of shares 15

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (other than as set forth in Section 2.1 hereof), for a period not to exceed twenty (20) consecutive calendar days and not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days in any twelve-month period (each a "Black Out Period"), provided that there must be an interim period of at least sixty (60) consecutive days between the end of one Black Out Period and the beginning of another Black Out Period, the Company will not be required to file any registration statement pursuant to this Agreement, file any amendment thereto, furnish any supplement to a prospectus included in a registration statement pursuant to Section 2.4.1(e)(iii) hereof, make any other filing with the SEC required pursuant to this Agreement, cause any registration statement or other filing with the SEC to become effective, or take any similar action, and any and all sales of Registrable Securities by the Investors pursuant to an effective registration 16
statement shall be suspended: (i) if an event has occurred and is continuing as a result of which any such registration statement or prospectus would, in the Company's reasonable judgment based on advice of outside counsel to the Company, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) if the Company notifies the Investors that such actions would, in the good faith judgment of outside counsel to the Company, require the disclosure of material non-public information which the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential and which the Company would not otherwise be required to disclose or (iii) if the Company notifies the Investors that, in the Company's good faith judgment (after consultation with the Company's proposed managing underwriter, initial purchaser or outside financial advisor), it is necessary to suspend sales of Registrable Securities by the Investors, to facilitate a pending or proposed public or Rule 144A offering by the Company or Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, provided, however, that the Company (X) shall not be able to exercise any rights under this clause (iii) during the first three (3) months following the date hereof, and (Y) shall only be able to use its blocking rights under this clause (iii) for a period not to exceed 15 consecutive days and not more than two times in any twelve month period.

If the Company does not take the foregoing action as required to permit the Investors to sell the Registrable Securities upon the end of the permitted relevant Black Out Period, the Company shall pay to the Investors the Delay Fee for the number of days that the Investors are unable to sell Registrable Securities. 2.6.2 Suspension of Dispositions. Each Investor agrees by acquisition of any Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice (a "Suspension Notice") from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.4.1(e)(iii) hereof such Investor will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Registrable Securities (the "Suspension Period") until such Investor's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus, or until it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, such Investor will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Investor's possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts and take such actions as are reasonably necessary to render the Advice as promptly as practicable. 2.6.3 Extensions. For the purposes of Sections 2.1.1, 2.1.6, 2.3.1 and 4.1 hereof, the occurrence of any Blackout Period or Suspension Period pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall cause the second anniversary of the date hereof to be deemed extended by the number of days equivalent to the duration of any periods during which the Holder may not sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement required hereunder. 17
2.7 Indemnification. 2.7.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each underwriter of Registrable Securities, each Investor and each of such Investor's directors, officers, employees and agents and each other Person who controls the Investor Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) (each an "Investor Affiliate" and collectively, the "Investor Affiliates") (i) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, joint or several (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements except as limited by Section 2.7.3 hereof) ("Damages") based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or preliminary prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage, and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission and (iii) against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) as may be reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, or such violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, to the extent that any such expense or cost is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such statements are made in reliance upon and in strict conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Investor or any Investor Affiliate for use therein or arise from an Investor's or any Investor Affiliate's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the Company has furnished an Investor or any Investor Affiliate with a sufficient number of copies of the same. The reimbursements required by this Section 2.7.1 will be made by periodic payments during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred. 2.7.2 Indemnification by the Investor. In connection with any registration statement in which an Investor is participating, each such Investor will, to the fullest extent permitted by law will indemnify the Company and its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) against any and all Damages resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material 18
fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus, or any preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Investor or any Investor Affiliate specifically for inclusion in the registration statement; provided, however, that the obligation to indemnify will be several, not joint and several, among such Investors of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Investor of Registrable Securities will be in proportion to, and provided, further, that such liability will be limited to, the net amount received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement; provided, that such Investor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that prior to the filing of any such registration statement or prospectus or amendment thereof or supplement thereto, such Investor has furnished in writing to the Company information expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto which corrected or made not misleading information previously furnished to the Company. 2.7.3 Notice of Claims, etc. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (A) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not limit the rights of such Person except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice) and (B) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with a single counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (X) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (Y) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person. In the event the indemnified party reasonably believes such a conflict of interest exists, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party for all reasonable costs and expenses of one separate counsel for the indemnified party in accordance with Sections 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof) above, as applicable. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). If such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (1) such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the indemnified party and the settlement or compromise does not require any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified party or (2) the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing. An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and 19
expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party, a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such additional counsel or counsels. 2.7.4 Contribution. Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided that in no event shall the obligation of any indemnifying party to contribute under this Section 2.7.4 exceed the amount that such indemnifying party would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Sections 2.7.1 or 2.7.2 hereof had been available under the circumstances. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.7.4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Investors or any underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 2.7.4. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or, except as provided in Section 2.7.3 hereof, defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.7.4, the Investors shall not be required to contribute an amount greater than the dollar amount by which the net proceeds received by the Investors with respect to the sale of any Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of damages which such Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any and all untrue or alleged untrue statements of material fact or omissions or alleged omissions of material fact made in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto related to such sale of Registrable Securities.

The rights to have the Company register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be assignable by the Holder and any subsequent Investor, in whole or in part, including the Holder's rights pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof to an Investor (a "Transferee"), provided that: (i) the Holder agrees in writing with the Transferee to transfer or assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is promptly furnished to the Company after such transfer or assignment; (ii) the Company is, promptly after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the name and address of such Transferee, and (b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned and the amount being transferred or assigned; (iii) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the Transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein (including with respect to Section 2.5.2); (iv) such Transferee shall be an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act; (v) in the event the assignment occurs subsequent to the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement required to be filed pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, the Transferee agrees to pay all reasonable expenses of amending or supplementing such Registration Statement to reflect such assignment; provided, however, that any assignment by the Holder of its rights hereunder to any of its subsidiaries shall not be subject to this clause v; and (vi) after giving effect to the Transfer, the Transferee will beneficially own not less than 30% of the Common Stock issued under the Acquisition Agreement (or such comparable amount of Registrable Securities).
