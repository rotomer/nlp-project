Item 2.01. Completion of Disposition of Assets. On December 23, 2005 (the "Closing Date"), Leucadia National Corporation (the "Company") completed the sale of its telecommunications subsidiary, WilTel Communications Group, LLC ("WilTel"), to Level 3 Communications, Inc. ("Level 3") for aggregate consideration of $486 million (including $16 million for excess working capital, which is subject to adjustment, and $100 million in cash to reflect that amount of cash left in WilTel), and 115 million newly issued shares of Level 3 common stock. In connection with the sale, the Company retained certain assets and liabilities of WilTel that were not purchased by Level 3. The retained assets include (i) WilTel's headquarters building located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (ii) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million, (iii) corporate aircraft and related capital lease obligations, and (iv) marketable securities. In addition, the Company retained all of WilTel's right to receive cash payments from SBC Communications Inc. totaling $236 million, pursuant to the previously announced Termination, Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement dated June 15, 2005 among the Company, WilTel and SBC. Prior to the closing, WilTel repaid its long-term debt obligations using its funds, together with funds advanced by the Company. The retained liabilities also include WilTel's defined benefit pension plan and supplemental retirement plan obligation and certain other employee related liabilities and other claims. The agreement with Level 3 requires that all parties make the appropriate filings to treat the purchase of WilTel as a purchase of assets for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. As a result, WilTel's operating loss carryforwards, including any tax loss carryforwards generated by the sale, will remain with the Company. The Company currently estimates that after the closing it has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4.9 billion, which are subject to qualifications, limitations and uncertainties as discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed during 2005. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (a) Financial statements of businesses acquired Not applicable. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, which have been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 2
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented for informational purposes only, is based upon estimates by the Company's management and is not intended to be indicative of the Company's actual consolidated financial position after the transaction was consummated on the Closing Date, and they may not be indicative of consolidated results of operations in the future. On December 23, 2005, the Company completed the sale to Level 3 of all of the membership interests in WilTel, excluding certain specified WilTel assets and liabilities. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2005 has been prepared assuming that the transaction was consummated on that date. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations have been prepared assuming that the transaction was consummated on January 1, 2002; however, the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations do not contain any pro forma adjustments to reflect hypothetical earnings on the sale proceeds received. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the following notes: 1. Pro Forma Adjustments for the Sale: The unaudited pro forma balance sheet reflects the purchase price paid by Level 3 of $486 million (including $16 million for excess working capital, which is subject to adjustment, and $100 million in cash to reflect that amount of cash left in WilTel), and 115 million newly issued shares of Level 3 common stock with an aggregate market value of $339 million based on the $2.95 per share closing price of Level 3 common stock on December 22, 2005. In addition, the Company retained all of WilTel's right to receive cash payments from SBC Communications Inc. totaling $236 million, pursuant to the previously announced Termination, Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement dated June 15, 2005 among the Company, WilTel and SBC. The pro forma adjustments include the recognition of $204.3 million of this amount as a receivable, which represents the amount of the SBC payment that had not been accrued in the historical financial statements as of September 30, 2005. The pro forma balance sheet also reflects the elimination of the historical assets and liabilities of WilTel purchased by Level 3, estimated expenses and other charges related to the transaction, estimated deferred income tax expense and estimated after-tax gain on the sale of $146 million. As discussed above, WilTel's headquarters building located in Tulsa, Oklahoma was not sold to Level 3. The Company believes that the closing of this transaction is a change in circumstances that indicates the carrying amount of the headquarters building may not be recoverable, and the Company will be evaluating the recoverability of this asset in connection with the preparation of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. Although the Company has not yet determined how much the carrying amount of the headquarters building needs to be adjusted (if any), the pro forma adjustments include a pre-tax charge of approximately $40 million to reduce the gain on sale for a possible impairment. 3
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations reflect the elimination of the historical operating results of WilTel, which will be classified as a discontinued operation. The pro forma adjustments reflected on the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations are the same adjustments the Company expects to record when it reclassifies WilTel's historical operating results as a discontinued operation in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. 2. Pro Forma Adjustments for Debt Repayment: The purchase agreement with Level 3 required the payment in full of WilTel's obligations under its credit agreement prior to closing ($357.5 million outstanding at September 30, 2005) and required the Company to obtain a release for WilTel from any obligation under the outstanding mortgage note secured by its headquarters building ($59.7 million outstanding at September 30, 2005). These obligations were paid in full in November 2005; the pro forma adjustments reflect this repayment along with accrued interest, the write-off of unamortized debt expenses and the reversal of accrued arrangement fees that will not be paid. 4
