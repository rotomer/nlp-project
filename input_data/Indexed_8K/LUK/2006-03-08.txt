March 8, 2006 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Laura Ulbrandt (212) 460-1900 LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 2005 RESULTS Leucadia National Corporation (LUK - NYSE) today announced its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005. During 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment that reduced the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and credited income tax expense by $1,135,100,000. Although this adjustment significantly increases reported net income for the period and shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2005, it is not a cash gain, and it does not represent any immediate income tax savings. The adjustment results from the Company's conclusion that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the net deferred tax asset, and is required to be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles. Net income was $1,636,041,000 (including the $1,135,100,000 adjustment referred to above) or $14.27 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $145,500,000 or $1.34 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net income for 2005 included $411,929,000 of income from discontinued operations or $3.56 per diluted common share, including gain on disposal, while net income for 2004 included $63,049,000 of losses from discontinued operations or $.56 per diluted common share, including gain on disposal. For more information on the adjustment described above and the Company's results of operations for 2005, please see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
