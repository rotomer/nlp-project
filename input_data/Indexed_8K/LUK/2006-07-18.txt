Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On July 15, 2006, Leucadia National Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Subscription Agreement dated July 15, 2006 by and among Fortescue Metals Group Ltd ("Fortescue"), its subsidiary, FMG Chichester Pty Ltd ("FMG"), and the Company pursuant to which the Company has agreed to invest an aggregate of $400 million in Fortescue and its Pilbara iron ore infrastructure project in Western Australia (the "Project"). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Company will acquire 26.4 million common shares of Fortescue, representing approximately 9.99% of the common stock of Fortescue to then be outstanding, and a 13 year, $100 million note of FMG. Interest on the note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the Project. The note will be unsecured and will be subordinate to the secured debt to be issued in respect of the Project. The Company's obligation to consummate the investment is subject to Fortescue obtaining approximately $2 billion of additional financing for the Project, including senior secured financing, on terms acceptable to the Company. If this condition is not satisfied or waived by December 31, 2006, either party will be able to terminate the Subscription Agreement. Following consummation of the investment, Leucadia will have the right to nominate one director to the Fortescue Board of Directors.
