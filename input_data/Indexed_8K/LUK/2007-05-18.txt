Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers: - --------------------------------------------- On May 15, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company awarded performance bonuses for 2006 of $3,908,304 (the "2006 Bonus") to each of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the Board and President, respectively, of the Company. The 2006 Bonuses were awarded under the Company's 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, which provides for an annual incentive bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each year through 2014, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. The amount of the 2006 Bonus was equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 and did not reflect any discretionary reduction as permitted under the Incentive Bonus Plan. The Incentive Bonus Plan is designed so that the cash bonuses awarded under will qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. After giving effect to the 2006 Bonus, the amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table contained in the Company's Proxy Statement dated April 17, 2007 under the columns "Bonus" and "Total" would have increased by the amount of the 2006 Bonus for each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg. As a result, total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2006 would have been $11,805,034 for Mr. Cumming and $11,824,949 for Mr. Steinberg. 2
