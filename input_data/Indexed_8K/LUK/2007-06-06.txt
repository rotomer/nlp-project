Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. The response to this Item is contained in the response to Item 2.01 below. Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On June 1, 2007, BEI-RZT Corporation ("BEI-RZT"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation (the "Company"), completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ResortQuest International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, from Gaylord Hotels, Inc., pursuant to a stock purchase agreement entered into on June 1, 2007 between BEI-RZT, Gaylord Hotels, Inc., and Gaylord Entertainment Company (the "Agreement"). Prior to this transaction, ResortQuest International sold its Hawaiian subsidiaries; as a result, BEI-RZT only acquired the continental United States and Canadian subsidiaries of ResortQuest International, Inc., referred to as ResortQuest Mainland. ResortQuest Mainland is engaged in offering management services to vacation properties in beach and mountain resort locations in the continental U.S. and Canada, as well as in real estate brokerage services and other rental and property owner services. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the contractual purchase price of $35,000,000 will be adjusted to reflect net working capital (as defined in the Agreement) at closing, and is payable in cash and an $8,000,000 10% four-year promissory note of BEI-RZT. At closing, estimated net negative working capital of $16,400,000 reduced the cash portion payable at closing by BEI-RZT to $10,600,000; this amount is subject to final adjustment once the actual closing date net working capital is determined. For accounting purposes, assuming no change to estimated net working capital, the aggregate purchase price was $18,600,000, excluding expenses. The Company is reporting this acquisition pursuant to Instruction 4 (ii) of Item 2.01. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired. To be filed by amendment by August 17, 2007. (b) Pro Forma Financial Information. To be filed by amendment by August 17, 2007. 2
