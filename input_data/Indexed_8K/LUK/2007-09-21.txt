(the "Underwriter"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriter of 5,500,000 shares of its common shares, par value $1.00 per share (the "Securities"). Concurrent with such sale and purchase, the Company intends to sell and the Underwriter intends to purchase $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Concurrent Offering") such sale and purchase to be subject to the terms and conditions of a separate underwriting agreement to be entered into by the Company and the Underwriter and the closing of which shall be a condition to the sale and offer of the Securities contemplated hereby. The Company understands that the Underwriter proposes to make a public offering of the Securities (the "Offering") as soon as it deems advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered). The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-145668) relating to the Securities and has filed with, or transmitted for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or transmit for filing to, the Commission (i) a related prospectus dated August 24, 2007 (the "Base Prospectus"), (ii) a prospectus supplement (the "Original Prospectus Supplement") dated August 24, 2007 specifically relating to the Securities pursuant to Rule 430B and Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and (iii) a second prospectus supplement (the "Second Prospectus Supplement") dated September 19, 2007. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto at such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act at such time and the documents otherwise -2-
deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act (the "Securities Act Regulations"), is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The final prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriter for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses that form a part thereof, including without limitation the Prospectus Supplement dated as of September 19, 2007, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to the Underwriter that, as of the date hereof, the Applicable Time referred to in Section 1(b) and as of the Closing Time referred to in Section 2(c) hereof: (a) At the time of filing the Original Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act") or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act Regulations) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 of the Securities Act Regulations and (iv) at the date hereof, the Company was and is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 405"), including not having been and not being an "ineligible issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, and the Securities, since their registration on the Registration Statement, have been and remain eligible for registration by the Company on a Rule 405 "automatic shelf registration statement". The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. At the time of filing the Original Registration Statement, at the earliest time thereafter that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Rule 405. (b) The Original Registration Statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 462(e)") on August 24, 2007, and any post-effective amendment thereto also became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e). No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or -3-
are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. Any offer that is a written communication relating to the Securities made prior to the filing of the Original Registration Statement by the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act Regulations) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the exemption provided by Rule 163 of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 163") and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163, including without limitation the legending requirement, to qualify such offer for the exemption from Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provided by Rule 163. At the respective times the Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto became effective, at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriter pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations and at the Closing Time, the Registration Statement complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations and the Exchange Act Regulations, and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Neither the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement was issued and at the Closing Time, included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each preliminary prospectus (including the prospectus or prospectuses filed as part of the Original Registration Statement or any amendment thereto) complied when so filed in all material respects with the Securities Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriter for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.

"Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule B hereto. "Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not an Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus.

The Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby agrees: (a) The Company, subject to Section 3(b), will comply with the requirements of Rule 430B and will notify the Underwriter immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities shall become effective, or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or for additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Securities Act concerning the Registration Statement and (v) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act in connection with the offering of the Securities. The Company will effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the form of prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424(b) was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file such prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) (i) of the Securities Act Regulations without regard to -11-
the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)). (b) The Company will give the Underwriter notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Original Registration Statement or amendment thereto at the time it became effective) or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Underwriter with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Underwriter or counsel for the Underwriter shall reasonably object. The Company has given the Underwriter notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or Exchange Act Regulations within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Underwriter notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and will furnish the Underwriter with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Underwriter or counsel for the Underwriter shall reasonably object. (c) The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriter, without charge, signed copies of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Underwriter, without charge, a conformed copy of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for the Underwriter. The copies of the Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriter will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (d) The Company has delivered to the Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as the Underwriter reasonably requested, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities Act. The Company will furnish to the Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriter will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. -12-
(e) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations, the Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriter or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or to file a new registration statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities) and the Company will furnish to the Underwriter such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriter may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriter and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission. (f) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriter, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the Underwriter may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or so subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company will also supply the Underwriter with such information as is necessary for the determination of the legality of the Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may request. (g) The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the -13-
purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriter the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act. (h) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds." (i) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act within the time periods required by the Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Regulations. (j) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Underwriter, and the Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that the Underwriter is authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Underwriter is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping. (k) The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange. (l) The Company represents and agrees that, for a period of 60 days from the date hereof, it will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, dispose of any of its Securities or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for its Securities, except for the issuance of Securities or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Securities pursuant to compensatory plans currently in place and upon the exercise of options or conversion, exercise or exchange of securities outstanding on the date hereof. SECTION 4. Conditions of Underwriter's Obligations.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities of any kind to which the Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state, in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and, subject to the provisions hereof, will reimburse, as incurred, the Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; provided, however, the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent (but only to the extent) that any such loss, claim, damage or liability is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, unappealable judgment, to have resulted solely from (x) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Underwriter furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein or (y) the failure of the Underwriter -17-
to convey the Scripted Information as contemplated by Section 2(b). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. The Company shall not be liable under this Section 5 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) are finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, unappealable judgment, to have resulted solely from: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent (but only to the extent) that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter, furnished to the Company or its agents by the Underwriter specifically for use therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any legal or other expenses incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Underwriter may otherwise have to the indemnified parties; or (iii) the failure to convey any of the Scripted Information as contemplated by Section 2(b). (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 5, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and only to the extent it is materially prejudiced as a result thereof and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In -18-
case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if (A) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (B) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel in writing that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (C) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties at the expense of the indemnifying party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Underwriter in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 5 or the Company in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 5, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent. (d) No indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 5 for any settlement of any claim or action (or threatened claim or action) effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if a claim or action settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff with respect to any such claim or action, each indemnifying party jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (and legal and other expenses as set forth -19-
above) incurred by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the indemnified party, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (e) In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 5 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contributions, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, from the Offering or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriter, on the other, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omissions, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. (f) The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution determined pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (e) were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph (e). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, the Underwriter shall not be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent -20-
misrepresentation. For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph (e), each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. SECTION 6. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive. The representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and contribution and expense reimbursement provisions and other agreements, representations and warranties of the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, and will survive, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, (ii) acceptance of the Securities, and payment for them hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement. SECTION 7. Termination of Agreement. The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Time by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any Material Adverse Effect or development involving or reasonably expected to result in a prospective Material Adverse Effect that could, in the Underwriter's reasonable judgment, be expected to make (i) it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus, or (ii) materially impair the investment quality of any of the Securities; (b) the failure of the Company to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 4(b) hereof on or prior to the Closing Time; (c) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, including acts of terrorism, or material adverse change or disruption in economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States (it being understood that any such change or disruption shall be relative to such conditions and markets as in effect on the date hereof), if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, calamity, crisis, act or material adverse change in the economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States could be reasonably expected to make it, in the Underwriter's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market or proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of any of the Securities; (d) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or the suspension or limitation of trading generally in securities on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market or any setting of limitations on prices for securities on any such exchange; -21-
(e) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation after the date hereof of any Applicable Law that in the Underwriter's counsel's reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects, or could be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect, the properties, business, prospects, operations, earnings, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (f) the declaration of a banking moratorium by any Governmental Authority; or the taking of any action by any Governmental Authority after the date hereof in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs that in the Underwriter's opinion could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere. SECTION 8. Default by the Underwriter. If the Underwriter shall breach its obligations to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder as of the Closing Time and arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Underwriter without liability on the part of the Company. Nothing herein shall relieve the Underwriter from liability for its default. SECTION 9. No Fiduciary Relationship. The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting solely as underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to either of the Companies or their respective management, stockholders or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Underwriter may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriter hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations to either of the companies, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriter agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriter to the Company regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that either of the Company may have against the Underwriter with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions. SECTION 10. Payment of Expenses. (a) Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the preparation, printing and delivery to the -22-
Underwriter of this Agreement, the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and such other documents as may be required in connection with the offering, purchase, sale, issuance or delivery of the Securities, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the Securities to the Underwriter, (iv) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, accountants and other advisors, (v) the qualification of the Securities under securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter in connection therewith (vi) the printing and delivery to the Underwriter of copies of each preliminary prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto and any costs associated with electronic delivery of any of the foregoing by the Underwriter to investors and (vii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Securities, including without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and any such consultants, and the cost of aircraft and other transportation chartered in connection with the road show.

LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION (A NEW YORK CORPORATION) $500,000,000 8-1/8% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015 UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT ---------------------- September 20, 2007 JEFFERIES & COMPANY, INC. 520 Madison Avenue New York, New York 10022 Ladies and Gentlemen: Leucadia National Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement (the "Agreement") with Jefferies & Company, Inc. (the "Underwriter"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriter of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of September 25, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). Concurrent with the such issuance and sale, the Company intends to sell and the Underwriter intends to purchase 5,500,000 shares of its common shares, par value $1.00 per share (the "Concurrent Offering") such sale and purchase to be subject to the terms and conditions of a separate underwriting agreement to be entered into by the Company and the Underwriter and the closing of which shall be a condition to the sale and offer of the Securities contemplated hereby. The Company understands that the Underwriter proposes to make a public offering of the Securities (the "Offering") as soon as it deems advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-145668) relating to the Securities and has filed with, or transmitted for filing to, or shall promptly hereafter file with or transmit for filing to, the Commission (i) a related prospectus dated August 24, 2007 (the "Base Prospectus") and (ii) a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") specifically relating to the Securities pursuant to Rule 430B and Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto at such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein -1-
pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act (the "Securities Act Regulations"), is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The final prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriter for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to the Underwriter that, as of the date hereof, the Applicable Time referred to in Section 1(b) and as of the Closing Time referred to in Section 2(c) hereof: (a) (i) At the time of filing the Original Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act") or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act Regulations) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 of the Securities Act Regulations and (iv) at the date hereof, the Company was and is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 405"), including not having been and not being an "ineligible issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, and the Securities, since their registration on the Registration Statement, have been and remain eligible for registration by the Company on a Rule 405 "automatic shelf registration statement". The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. At the time of filing the Original Registration Statement, at the earliest time thereafter that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Rule 405. (b) The Original Registration Statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 462(e)") on August 24, 2007, and any post-effective amendment thereto also became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e). No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or -2-
are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. Any offer that is a written communication relating to the Securities made prior to the filing of the Original Registration Statement by the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act Regulations) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the exemption provided by Rule 163 of the Securities Act Regulations ("Rule 163") and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163, including without limitation the legending requirement, to qualify such offer for the exemption from Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provided by Rule 163. At the respective times the Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto became effective, at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriter pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the Securities Act Regulations and at the Closing Time, the Registration Statement complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act (the "1939 Act Regulations"), and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Neither the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement was issued and at the Closing Time, included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each preliminary prospectus (including the prospectus or prospectuses filed as part of the Original Registration Statement or any amendment thereto) complied when so filed in all material respects with the Securities Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriter for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.

"Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule B hereto.

The Company will effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the form of prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424(b) was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file such prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) (i) of the Securities Act Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)). (b) The Company will give the Underwriter notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities or any amendment, supplement or revision to either any preliminary prospectus (including any prospectus included in the Original Registration Statement or amendment thereto at the time it became effective) or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, and the Company will furnish the Underwriter with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Underwriter or counsel for the Underwriter shall reasonably object. The Company has given the Underwriter notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or Exchange Act Regulations within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Underwriter notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and will furnish the Underwriter with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Underwriter or counsel for the Underwriter shall reasonably object. (c) The Company has furnished or will deliver to the Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriter, without charge, signed copies of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of experts, and will also deliver to the Underwriter, without charge, a conformed copy of the Original Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) for the Underwriter. The copies of the Original Registration Statement and each -11-
amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriter will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (d) The Company has delivered to the Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as the Underwriter reasonably requested, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities Act. The Company will furnish to the Underwriter, without charge, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriter will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (e) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations, the Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the 1939 Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriter or for the Company, to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or to file a new registration statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities) and the Company will furnish to the Underwriter such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriter may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriter and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission. -12-
(f) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriter, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the Underwriter may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or so subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company will also supply the Underwriter with such information as is necessary for the determination of the legality of the Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may request. (g) The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriter the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act. (h) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds." (i) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act within the time periods required by the Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Regulations. (j) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Underwriter, and the Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that the Underwriter is authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Underwriter is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping. SECTION 4. Conditions of Underwriter's Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriter hereunder are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions: (a) The Registration Statement has become effective and at Closing Time no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued under the Securities Act or proceedings -13-
therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of counsel to the Underwriter. A prospectus containing the Rule 430B Information shall have been filed with the Commission in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8) (or a post-effective amendment providing such information shall have been filed and become effective in accordance with the requirements of Rule 430B). The Company shall have paid the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time period required by Rule 456(1)(i) of the Securities Act Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act Regulations and, if applicable, shall have updated the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b). (b) All the representations and warranties of the Company and its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement and in each of the Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof and at the Closing Time. On or prior to the Closing Time, the Company and each other party to the Documents (other than the Underwriter) shall have performed or complied with all of the agreements and satisfied all conditions on their respective parts to be performed, complied with or satisfied pursuant to the Documents (other than conditions to be satisfied by such other parties, which the failure to so satisfy would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect). (c) No injunction, restraining order or order of any nature by a Governmental Authority shall have been issued as of the Closing Time that would prevent or materially interfere with the consummation of the Offering or any of the transactions contemplated under the Documents. (d) No action shall have been taken and no Applicable Law shall have been enacted, adopted or issued that would, as of the Closing Time, prevent the consummation of the Offering. No Proceeding shall be pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened other than Proceedings that (A) if adversely determined would not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the issuance or marketability of the Securities, and (B) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. (e) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which data and information are given in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus, there shall not have been any Material Adverse Change. (f) The Underwriter shall have received as of the Closing Time: (i) certificates dated as of the Closing Time, signed by (1) the Chief Executive Officer and (2) the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, on behalf of the Company, to the effect that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 1 hereof are true and correct in all material respects with -14-
the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Time, (b) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions in all material respects on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Time, (c) as of the Closing Time, since the date hereof or since the date of the most recent financial statements in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto after the date hereof) no event or events have occurred, no information has become known nor does any condition exist that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect, (d) since the date of the most recent financial statements in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto after the date hereof), other than as described in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus or contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, not in the ordinary course of business, that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or entered into any transactions not in the ordinary course of business that are material to the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and there has not been any change in the capital stock or long-term indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that is material to the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (e) the sale of the Securities has not been enjoined (temporarily or permanently); (ii) a certificate, dated as of the Closing Time, executed by the Secretary of the Company, certifying such matters as the Underwriter may reasonably request; (iii) the opinion of Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to the Company, dated as of the Closing Time, in form satisfactory to the Underwriter covering such matters as are customarily covered in such opinions; (iv) an opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel to the Underwriter, in form satisfactory to the Underwriter covering such matters as are customarily covered in such opinions.

referred to therein for the carrying out of procedures shall be no more than three business days prior to the Closing Time, as the case may be. (i) Each of the Documents shall have been executed and delivered by all parties thereto, and the Underwriter shall have received a fully executed original of each Document. (j) The Underwriter shall have received copies of all opinions, certificates, letters and other documents delivered under or in connection with the Offering or any transaction contemplated in the Documents. (k) The terms of each Document shall conform in all material respects to the description thereof in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus. SECTION 5. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities of any kind to which the Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state, in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and, subject to the provisions hereof, will reimburse, as incurred, the Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; provided, however, the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent (but only to the extent) that any such loss, claim, damage or liability is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, unappealable judgment, to have resulted solely from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Underwriter furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. The Company shall not be liable under this -16-
Section 5 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) are finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, unappealable judgment, to have resulted solely from: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent (but only to the extent) that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter, furnished to the Company or its agents by the Underwriter specifically for use therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any legal or other expenses incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Underwriter may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 5, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and only to the extent it is materially prejudiced as a result thereof and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if (A) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, -17-
(B) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel in writing that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (C) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties at the expense of the indemnifying party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Underwriter in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 5 or the Company in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 5, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent. (d) No indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 5 for any settlement of any claim or action (or threatened claim or action) effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if a claim or action settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff with respect to any such claim or action, each indemnifying party jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (and legal and other expenses as set forth above) incurred by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the indemnified party, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such -18-
proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (e) In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 5 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contributions, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, from the Offering or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriter, on the other, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omissions, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. (f) The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution determined pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (e) were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph (e). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, the Underwriter shall not be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph (e), each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section -19-
20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. SECTION 6. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive. The representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and contribution and expense reimbursement provisions and other agreements, representations and warranties of the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, and will survive, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, (ii) acceptance of the Securities, and payment for them hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement. SECTION 7. Termination of Agreement. The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Time by written notice to the Company if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any Material Adverse Effect or development involving or reasonably expected to result in a prospective Material Adverse Effect that could, in the Underwriter's reasonable judgment, be expected to make (i) it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus, or (ii) materially impair the investment quality of any of the Securities; (b) the failure of the Company to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 4(b) hereof on or prior to the Closing Time; (c) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, including acts of terrorism, or material adverse change or disruption in economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States (it being understood that any such change or disruption shall be relative to such conditions and markets as in effect on the date hereof), if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, calamity, crisis, act or material adverse change in the economic conditions in, or in the financial markets of, the United States could be reasonably expected to make it, in the Underwriter's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market or proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the preliminary prospectus and Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of any of the Securities; (d) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or the suspension or limitation of trading generally in securities on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market or any setting of limitations on prices for securities on any such exchange; (e) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation after the date hereof of any Applicable Law that in the Underwriter's counsel's reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects, or could be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect, the properties, business, prospects, operations, earnings, assets, liabilities or -20-
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (f) the declaration of a banking moratorium by any Governmental Authority; or the taking of any action by any Governmental Authority after the date hereof in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs that in the Underwriter's opinion could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere. SECTION 8. Default by the Underwriter. If the Underwriter shall breach its obligations to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder as of the Closing Time and arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Underwriter without liability on the part of the Company. Nothing herein shall relieve the Underwriter from liability for its default. SECTION 9. No Fiduciary Relationship. The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting solely as underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to either of the Companies or their respective management, stockholders or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Underwriter may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriter hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations to either of the companies, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriter agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriter to the Company regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that either of the Company may have against the Underwriter with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions. SECTION 10. Payment of Expenses. (a) Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the preparation, printing and delivery to the Underwriter of this Agreement, the Indenture and such other documents as may be required in connection with the offering, purchase, sale, issuance or delivery of the Securities, (iii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificates for the Securities to the Underwriter, (iv) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, accountants and other -21-
advisors, (v) the qualification of the Securities under securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter in connection therewith (vi) the printing and delivery to the Underwriter of copies of each preliminary prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto and any costs associated with electronic delivery of any of the foregoing by the Underwriter to investors, (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities and (viii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Securities, including without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and any such consultants, and the cost of aircraft and other transportation chartered in connection with the road show.
