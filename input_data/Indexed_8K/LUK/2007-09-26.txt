The Securities and the certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate revisions to reflect the initial interest accrual date and initial interest payment date of any Additional Securities. The provisions of Exhibit A are part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends and endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. The Company shall approve the form of the Securities and any notation, legend or endorsement on them. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. One Officer and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall be valid nevertheless. A Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. The Trustee or an authenticating agent shall authenticate (i) Initial Securities for original issue in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500,000,000, and (ii) Additional Securities as provided in Section 2.14, in each case upon a written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate.

In the event that the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate any Securities issued under this Indenture subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the same "CUSIP" number for such Securities as is printed on the Securities outstanding at such time; provided, however, that if any series of Securities issued under this Indenture subsequent to the Issue Date is determined, to be a different class of security than the Securities outstanding at such time for federal income tax purposes, the Company may obtain a "CUSIP" number for such Securities that is different than the "CUSIP" number printed on the Securities then outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Securities issued under this Indenture shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and no series of Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so except on original issuance. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or its Affiliates. The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture. Such agency agreement shall provide for reasonable compensation for such services. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such Agent and shall furnish the Trustee with an executed counterpart of any such agency agreement. If the Company fails to maintain or act as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be duly compensated therefor. The Registrar or a co-registrar and a Paying Agent shall be maintained by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. The Company initially designates the Trustee as the Registrar and Paying Agent. -8-
SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. At or prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay such principal and interest becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to enter into an agreement whereby it shall agree to hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal or interest on the Securities, and to notify the Trustee of any Default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such Default continues, the Trustee may require the Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon doing so, such Paying Agent (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold as separate trust funds all money held by it as Paying Agent. SECTION 2.05. Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the name and addresses of Securityholders and shall otherwise comply with TIA ss. 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee on or before each semiannual interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA ss. 312(a). SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. Subject to Sections 2.12 and 2.13, when a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of the Registrar are met. Subject to Sections 2.12 and 2.13, when Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the requirements of the Registrar are met. The Company shall cooperate with the Registrar in meeting its requirements. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. The Company or the Trustee may charge a reasonable fee for any registration of transfer or exchange and may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, but not for any exchange pursuant to Sections 2.09, 4.08 or 9.05. SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of the Trustee are met. An indemnity bond may be required by the Trustee or the Company that is sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee or -9-
any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company or the Trustee may charge for its expenses in replacing a Security. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Section 4.08 hereof, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or purchase such Security, as the case may be. Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Securities. SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Subject to Section 10.06, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates holds the Security. If a Security is replaced or paid pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced or paid Security is held by a protected purchaser. If any Paying Agent (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) holds on the maturity date of the Securities money received by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Indenture and sufficient to pay the principal and interest on Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. SECTION 2.09. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities surrendered to it. SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Securities surrendered for -10-
registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures unless the Company directs in writing their return to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. SECTION 2.11. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, it shall pay the defaulted interest plus any interest payable on the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix the record date and payment date. At least 10 days before the record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder a notice that states the record date, the payment date, and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner. SECTION 2.12. Book-Entry Provisions for Global Securities. The Initial Securities initially shall be represented by one or more Securities in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the "Global Securities"). All Global Securities shall bear the Global Security Legend. The Global Securities initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depository or the nominee of the Depository, in each case for credit to an account of an Agent Member, and (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depository. Members of, or direct or indirect participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depository or under the Global Securities. The Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of the Global Securities for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Security. (a) Transfers of Global Securities shall be limited to transfers in whole, but not in part, to the Depository, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in the Global Securities may be transferred or exchanged for Physical Securities only in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository and the provisions of Section 2.13. In addition, a Global Security shall be exchangeable for Physical Securities only if (i) the Depository (x) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for such Global Security or (y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and in either case the Company fails to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice or of the Company's becoming aware of such cessation, (ii) the Company, at its option and subject to the procedures of the Depository, notifies the Trustee in writing that it is electing to issue Physical Securities or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security. In all cases, Physical Securities delivered in exchange for any Global Security or beneficial interests therein shall be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the Depository in accordance with its customary procedures. Neither the -11-
Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the Depository in providing such registration information and the Company and the Trustee may conclusively rely on instructions from the Depository as to such registration information. In the event that a Physical Security is to be authenticated pursuant to this clause (a), the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee, a reasonable supply of Physical Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, unless such a supply has previously been made available to the Trustee. (b) In connection with the transfer of a Global Security as an entirety to beneficial owners pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.12, such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depository in writing in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations. (c) The Holder of any Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. SECTION 2.13. Transfer and Exchange of Securities. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities. A Global Security may not be transferred as a whole except as set forth in Section 2.12(a). Global Securities shall not be exchanged by the Company for Physical Securities except under the circumstances described in Section 2.13(c). Global Securities may be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Sections 2.07 and 2.09. Beneficial interests in a Global Security may be transferred and exchanged as provided in Section 2.13(b) or 2.13(c) below. (b) Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in Global Securities. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Securities shall be effected through the Depository, in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository. Beneficial interests in Global Securities shall be transferred or exchanged only for beneficial interests in Global Securities, except as provided in Section 2.12(a). Transfers and exchanges of beneficial interests in the Global Securities also shall require compliance with either subparagraph (i) or (ii) below, as applicable: (i) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Security. A beneficial interest in a Global Security may be transferred to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in such Global Security. No written orders or instructions shall be required to be delivered to the Registrar to effect the transfers described in this Section 2.13(b)(i). -12-
(ii) All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial Interests in Global Securities. In connection with all transfers and exchanges of beneficial interests in any Global Security that are not subject to Section 2.13(b)(i), the transferor of such beneficial interest must deliver to the Registrar (1) a written order from an Agent Member given to the Depository in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository directing the Depository to credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in another Global Security in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged and (2) instructions given in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository containing information regarding the Agent Member account to be credited with such increase. Upon satisfaction of all of the requirements for transfer or exchange of beneficial interests in Global Securities contained in this Indenture and the Securities or otherwise applicable under the Securities Act, the Trustee shall adjust the principal amount of the relevant Global Security or Global Securities pursuant to Section 2.13(f). (c) Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in Global Securities for Physical Securities. A beneficial interest in a Global Security may not be exchanged for a Physical Security except under the circumstances described in Section 2.12(a). A beneficial interest in a Global Security may not be transferred to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a Physical Security except under the circumstances described in Section 2.12(a). (d) Transfer and Exchange of Physical Securities for Beneficial Interests in Global Securities. A Holder of a Physical Security may exchange such Physical Security for a beneficial interest in a Global Security or transfer such Physical Security to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Security at any time. Upon receipt of a request for such an exchange or transfer, the Trustee shall cancel the applicable Physical Security and increase or cause to be increased the aggregate principal amount of one of the Global Securities. If any such transfer or exchange is effected pursuant to this paragraph (d) at a time when a Global Security has not yet been issued, the Company shall issue and, upon receipt of a written order of the Company in accordance with Section 2.02, the Trustee shall authenticate one or more Global Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Physical Securities transferred or exchanged pursuant to this paragraph (d). (e) Transfer and Exchange of Physical Securities for Physical Securities. Upon request by a Holder of Physical Securities, the Registrar shall register the transfer or exchange of Physical Securities. Prior to such registration of transfer or exchange, the requesting Holder shall present or surrender to the Registrar the Physical Securities duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by such Holder or by its attorney, duly authorized in writing. (f) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Securities. At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Security have been exchanged for Physical Securities or a particular Global Security has been repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Security shall be returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.10. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security or for Physical Securities, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced accordingly and an endorsement shall be -13-
made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depository at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security, such other Global Security shall be increased accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depository at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase. (g) General. All Global Securities and Physical Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Securities or Physical Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Securities or Physical Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. (h) The Trustee and the Registrar shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depository participants, members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. The Registrar shall retain for a period of two years copies of all letters, notices and other written communications received pursuant to Section 2.12 or this Section 2.13. The Company shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such letters, notices or other written communications at any reasonable time upon the giving of reasonable notice to the Registrar. SECTION 2.14. Issuance of Additional Securities. The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance, issue price, and amount of interest payable on the first payment date applicable thereto; provided that such issuance is not prohibited by Section 4.09. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Securities shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture. With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of its Board of Directors and in a Company Request, a copy of each of which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information: (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; (2) the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities and the amount of interest payable on the first payment date applicable thereto; provided, however, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and -14-
(3) any and all other terms of issuance with respect to such Additional Securities, including any terms which the Board of Directors deems appropriate. ARTICLE THREE REDEMPTION [Reserved]. ARTICLE FOUR COVENANTS SECTION 4.01. Payment of Securities. The Company shall pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities. An installment of principal or interest shall be considered paid on the date it is due if the Trustee or Paying Agent holds such installment in immediately available funds at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date such installment is due. Principal and interest on Global Securities shall be payable to the Depository or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of the Securities represented thereby. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities; it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. SECTION 4.02. SEC Reports. (a) The Company shall file with the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the SEC copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. If the Company is not subject to the requirements of such Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall continue to file with the Trustee on the same timely basis such reports, information and other documents as it would file if it were subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA ss. 314(a). (b) So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Company shall cause each annual, quarterly and other financial report mailed or otherwise furnished by it generally to stockholders to be filed with the Trustee and mailed to the Holders at their addresses appearing in the register of\ -15-
Securities maintained by the Registrar, in each case at the time of such mailing or furnishing to stockholders. If the Company is not required to furnish annual or quarterly reports to its stockholders pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company shall cause its financial statements, including any notes thereto and, with respect to annual reports, an auditors' report by an accounting firm of established national reputation and a "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," comparable to that which would have been required to appear in annual or quarterly reports filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to be so filed with the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each of the Company's fiscal years and within 60 days after the end of each of the first three quarters of each such fiscal year and, after the date such reports are so required to be filed with the Trustee, to be furnished to any Holder upon such Holder's request. (c) The Company shall provide the Trustee with a sufficient number of copies of all reports and other documents and information that the Trustee may be required to deliver to Securityholders under this Section 4.02. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such reports shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). SECTION 4.03. Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (which as of the Issue Date is December 31) an Officers' Certificate stating whether or not the signers know of any Default or Event of Default. If they do know of such a Default or Event of Default, the certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default and efforts to remedy the same. The Company shall notify the Trustee within 10 days following the occurrence thereof of any acceleration which is an Event of Default within the meaning of Section 6.01(4). SECTION 4.04. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange or for presentation for payment and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 10.02. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for such purposes. The Company will give prompt -16-
written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 4.05. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article Four, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each Material Subsidiary in accordance with the respective organizational documents of each Material Subsidiary and the rights (charter and statutory) and material franchises of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries; provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise, or the corporate existence of any Material Subsidiary, if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not, and will not be, adverse in any material respect to the Holders. SECTION 4.06. Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law, which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of and/or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. SECTION 4.07. Transactions with Affiliates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series of related transactions with any Affiliate (other than with the Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), including, without limitation, any loan, advance or investment or any purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property or the rendering of any service, unless such transaction or series of transactions is in good faith and at arm's length and on terms which are at least as favorable as those available in a comparable transaction from an unrelated Person. Any such transaction that involves in excess of $10,000,000 shall be approved by a majority of the Independent Directors on the Board of Directors of the Company; or, in the event that at the time of any such transaction or series of related transactions there are no Independent Directors serving on the Board of Directors of the Company, such transaction or series of related transactions shall be approved by a nationally recognized expert with experience in appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction for which approval is required. SECTION 4.08. Change of Control. (a) In the event of any Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase all or any portion (in integral multiples of $2,000) of such Holder's Securities on the date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") which is 20 business days after the -17-
date the Change of Control Notice as defined below is mailed (or such later date as is required by applicable law) at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the Change of Control Payment Date; provided that the Company will not be obligated to purchase any of such Securities unless Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Securities outstanding at the Change of Control Payment Date (other than Securities held by the Company and its Affiliates) shall have tendered their Securities for repurchase. In addition, in the event of any Change of Control, the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiaries to, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness ranking junior to the Securities pursuant to any analogous provisions prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. (b) The Company or, at the written request and expense of the Company, the Trustee shall send, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders, within five business days after the occurrence of each Change of Control, a notice of the occurrence of such Change of Control (the "Change of Control Notice") specifying a date by which a Holder must notify the Company of such Holder's intention to exercise the repurchase right and describing the procedure that such Holder must follow to exercise such right. The Company shall promptly deliver a copy of such notice to the Trustee and cause a copy of such notice to be published in a daily newspaper of national circulation. Each Change of Control Notice shall state: (1) the Change of Control Payment Date; (2) the date by which the repurchase right must be exercised; (3) the price at which the repurchase is to be made, if the repurchase right is exercised; and (4) a description of the procedure which the Holder must follow to exercise a repurchase right. No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notice shall limit any Holder's right to exercise a repurchase right. The Company shall comply with all applicable Federal and state securities laws in connection with each Change of Control Notice. (c) To exercise the repurchase right, the Holder shall deliver, on or before the fifth calendar day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, written notice to the Company (or an agent designated by the Company for such purpose) of the Holder's exercise of such right, together with (i) the Security or Securities with respect to which the right is being exercised, duly endorsed for transfer, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Security completed, and (ii) if the Change of Control Payment Date falls between any record date for the payment of interest on the Securities and the next succeeding interest payment date, an amount equal to the interest which the Holder is entitled to receive on such interest payment date. (d) Payment of the repurchase price of the Security or Securities with respect to which the repurchase right is exercised shall be deposited by the Company in immediately available funds by 9:00 A.M., New York City time on the Change of Control Payment Date. -18-
(e) A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to occur if (i) the Company has any other Indebtedness outstanding (other than Indebtedness under a bank credit agreement or similar bank financing) which provides for a Change of Control (as defined in the instrument governing such Indebtedness) if Ian M. Cumming or Joseph S. Steinberg ceases to beneficially own, in the aggregate, a certain percentage of the outstanding Common Shares, which percentage ownership requirement is in excess of 10%, and a Change of Control (as defined in the instrument governing such Indebtedness) occurs under such Indebtedness or (ii) at any time when the Company does not have any other Indebtedness outstanding of the type referred to in clause (i), Ian M. Cumming and/or Joseph S. Steinberg, individually or in the aggregate, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of (a "Disposition"), after the date hereof, Common Shares so that, after giving effect thereto, the sole beneficial ownership of outstanding Common Shares by Mr. Cumming and/or Mr. Steinberg would, in the aggregate, fall below 10% of the then outstanding Common Shares; provided, that no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred under clause (ii) if the Securities are rated by both Moody's and S&P as Investment Grade both at the time of such Disposition and for a period of 90 days from the date of such Disposition (it being understood that, with respect to the foregoing proviso, a Change of Control shall be deemed to occur on the first date during such 90-day period when the Securities are no longer rated as Investment Grade by Moody's and S&P). The term "Common Shares" shall include any securities issued as dividends or distributions on the Common Shares. For purposes hereof, "sole beneficial ownership" of Common Shares shall be deemed to include (i) all Common Shares received after June 15, 1992 from Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg by any member of their respective immediate families or by any trust for the benefit of either of them or any member of their respective immediate families (a "Recipient"), which Common Shares remain held by a Recipient during the lifetime of Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg (unless sold, transferred or disposed of by such Recipient during the lifetime of Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg, as the case may be, in which case such Disposition by such Recipient shall constitute a Disposition by Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg, as the case may be) and (ii) after the death of Mr. Cumming and/or Mr. Steinberg, all Common Shares owned as of the date of death by the decedent, and any Recipient of the decedent, regardless of whether such Recipient continues to own such Common Shares after the date of death. In determining the number of outstanding Common Shares then held by Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg and the total number of outstanding Common Shares, there shall be excluded Common Shares issued by the Company after December 31, 1991, or the conversion into or exchange for, after December 31, 1991, Common Shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares. (f) In the case of any Security which is to be purchased only in part the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge, a new Security or Securities, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Security which is not purchased. SECTION 4.09. Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness by the Company and on the Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock by Its Subsidiaries. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to issue any Preferred Stock, if, at the time -19-
of such event and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, the Company's ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, as of the most recent date for which consolidated financial statements are available and adjusted for the incurrence of all Indebtedness and the issuance of all Preferred Stock by Subsidiaries (other than Permitted Indebtedness) since that date, would be greater than 1.75 to 1. (b) Paragraph (a) of this Section 4.09 shall not preclude the incurrence of Permitted Indebtedness. SECTION 4.10. Limitation on Liens. (a) The Company will not, nor will it permit any Material Subsidiary to, (i) issue, assume or guarantee any Indebtedness, if such Indebtedness is secured by a Lien upon, or (ii) directly or indirectly secure any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any Material Subsidiary by a Lien upon, any Principal Property now owned or hereafter acquired, without in any such case effectively providing, concurrently with the issuance, assumption or guarantee of any such Indebtedness, or the granting of security with respect to any such outstanding Indebtedness, that the Securities (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of or guarantee by the Company or any Material Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities then existing or thereafter created) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) such Indebtedness; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to: (1) Liens on any Principal Property acquired after the Issue Date which are created or assumed contemporaneously with, or within 90 days after, such acquisition solely for the purpose of securing Indebtedness (including, but not limited to, deferred purchase price obligations) representing, or incurred to finance, refinance or refund, the purchase price or acquisition cost of the Principal Property subject thereto; provided that (a) the principal amount of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien does not exceed 100% of such purchase price or acquisition cost and (b) such Lien does not extend to or cover any Principal Property other than such Principal Property and any improvements thereon or rights appurtenant thereto acquired in such transaction; (2) Liens on any Principal Property acquired after the Issue Date existing at the time such Principal Property is acquired; (3) Liens on any Principal Property or shares of stock or Indebtedness acquired from or through a corporation which is merged with or into the Company or a Material Subsidiary; (4) Liens in favor of the Company or any Subsidiary; (5) Liens on any Principal Property in existence as of the Issue Date; (6) Liens on any Principal Property constituting unimproved real property constructed or improved by the Company or any Material Subsidiary after the Issue Date which are created or assumed contemporaneously with, or within 90 days after, such construction or improvement solely for the purpose of securing Indebtedness (including, but not limited to, deferred purchase price obligations) representing, or incurred to finance, -20-
refinance or refund, the cost of such construction or improvement; provided that (a) the principal amount of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien does not exceed 100% of such cost and (b) such Lien does not extend to or cover any Principal Property other than such unimproved real property and any improvements thereon or rights appurtenant thereto constructed or improved in such transaction; (7) Liens in favor of, or required by, any governmental authority; (8) pledges or deposits securing Indebtedness incurred in connection with workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation and deposits securing Indebtedness to insurance carriers under insurance or self-insurance arrangements or other pledges or deposits in the ordinary course of the insurance business of a Material Subsidiary of the Company that is a licensed insurance company, including, without limitation, those relating to the insurance or reinsurance operations of such Material Subsidiaries and those relating to the requirement to create "separate accounts"; (9) Liens securing Indebtedness incurred in connection with taxes not yet due or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; provided that adequate reserves with respect thereto are maintained on the books of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in conformity with GAAP; (10) Liens securing any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements) of Indebtedness of the Company or any Material Subsidiary which is outstanding on March 31, 1993; provided, however, that the principal amount of Indebtedness secured thereby shall not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness so secured at March 31, 1993; and (11) any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) through (10), inclusive; provided, however, that such extension, renewal, substitution or replacement shall be limited to all or part of the Principal Property which secured the Lien so extended, renewed, substituted or replaced (plus improvements on such Principal Property). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.10, the Company or any Material Subsidiary may (without equally and ratably securing the Securities) issue, assume or guarantee secured Indebtedness which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing Lien restrictions in an aggregate amount which, together with all other such secured Indebtedness of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries (that is, not including secured Indebtedness of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries permitted in accordance with Section 4.10(a)) and all Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions existing at such time (other than Sale and Lease-Back Transactions permitted in accordance with Section 4.11(a)), does not at the time exceed 15% of total shareholders' equity in the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as shown on the audited consolidated balance sheet contained in the latest annual report to shareholders of the Company. -21-
SECTION 4.11. Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph (a), the Company or any Material Subsidiary may enter into any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions if the amount of the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, together with all secured Indebtedness of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries (other than secured Indebtedness of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries permitted in accordance with Section 4.10(a)) and all other Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions existing at such time (other than Sale and Lease-Back Transactions permitted in accordance with Section 4.11(a)), does not at the time exceed 15% of total shareholders' equity in the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as shown on the audited consolidated balance sheet contained in the latest annual report to shareholders of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.12, any Material Subsidiary may create, incur, assume or guarantee the payment of Funded Debt in addition to that permitted by subsection (a) of this Section 4.12, and extend, renew, substitute or replace, in whole or in part, such Funded Debt; provided that at the time of such creation, incurrence, assumption, guarantee, extension, renewal, substitution or replacement, and after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Funded Debt of Material Subsidiaries does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. ARTICLE FIVE SUCCESSOR CORPORATION SECTION 5.01. When Company May Merge, etc. The Company shall not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets (it being understood that a sale of less than 90% of the Company's total assets shall not be deemed a sale, lease, conveyance or disposition of substantially all of the Company's assets), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, is a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, assumes by supplemental indenture in a form satisfactory to the Trustee all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (3) immediately before and immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (4) the Company (if the surviving entity) or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger, or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, shall immediately thereafter have a Consolidated Net Worth (after purchase accounting adjustments) at least equal to the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately preceding such transaction. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture, if any, comply with this Indenture. SECTION 5.02. Successor Person Substituted. Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or -23-
other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, the predecessor Person, except in the case of a lease, shall be relieved of all covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities ARTICLE SIX DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon repurchase or otherwise; (3) the Company fails to comply with any of its other agreements in the Securities or this Indenture and such default continues for the period and after the notice specified below; (4) (A) the Company or any Material Subsidiary defaults in the payment when due of principal of, interest on, or other amounts payable in respect of any of its respective Indebtedness (other than the Securities) in the aggregate principal or like amount of $30,000,000 or more, or (B) the Company or any Material Subsidiary fails to perform or comply with any of its other agreements in respect of any of its respective Indebtedness (other than the Securities) in the aggregate principal or like amount of $30,000,000 or more and such Indebtedness shall be or shall have been declared to be due and payable immediately and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled; (5) the Company or any Material Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case or proceeding, (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding, (C consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or (6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: -24-
(A) is for relief (with respect to the petition commencing such case) against the Company or any Material Subsidiary in an involuntary case or proceeding, (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Material Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of its respective property, or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any Material Subsidiary, and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days. The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, U.S. Code or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. A Default under clause (3) of this Section 6.01 is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities notify the Company and the Trustee (if such notice is given by Holders) of the Default and the Company does not cure the Default within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default." SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, and the accrued interest on, all of the Securities then outstanding due and payable immediately. Upon such declaration such principal and interest shall be due and immediately payable. If an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01 occurs, all unpaid principal of, and accrued interest on the Securities then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two paragraphs, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if all existing Defaults or Events of Default have been cured or waived (other than the non-payment of principal and interest due solely as a result of such acceleration) and if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree. When a Default or Event of Default is cured or waived, it ceases to exist. SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. -25-
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Subject to Sections 6.02, 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, or interest on, any Security. SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that is unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Securityholder, as such, or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by it which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Remedies. Except as provided in Section 6.07, a Securityholder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (5) no direction inconsistent with the request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities. A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over other Securityholders. -26-
SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders To Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security as set forth in this Indenture to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in the Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default in payment of interest or principal specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal and interest remaining unpaid and such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.07. SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. (a) The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. (b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding. SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07; Second: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and Third: to the Company. -27-
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section 6.10. SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities. ARTICLE SEVEN TRUSTEE SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise its rights and powers and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth (or incorporated by reference) in this Indenture and no others and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. (2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine such certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) This paragraph (c) does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section. (2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. -28-
(3) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05, and the Trustee shall be entitled from time to time to request such a direction. (4) The Trustee shall be under no obligation and may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. Subject to Section 7.01: (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee may rely on and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney, to the extent reasonably required by such inquiry or investigation. (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate or opinion. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care. (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers. (e) The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct. (f) The Trustee shall not be charged with notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default, unless either (i) a Trust Officer shall have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (ii) written -29-
notice of such Default or Event of Default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any Holder of the Securities. (g) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by it in compliance with such request, order or direction. (h) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all references to the Trustee shall be deemed to refer to the Trustee in its capacity as Trustee and, in connection with any agency function, in its capacity as Agent, and (ii) every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability or offering protection, immunity or indemnity to the Trustee shall be deemed to apply with the same force and effect to the Trustee acting in its capacity as Agent, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (h), and in respect to the Agent, as if no Event of Default had occurred and is continuing. SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication. SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder pursuant to Section 10.02 a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in any payment on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Securityholders. SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after each May 15, beginning with May 15, 2008 the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA ss. 313(a), but only if such report is required in any year under TIA ss. 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA ss.ss. 313(b) and 313(c). -30-
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Securities are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing if the Securities become listed on any national securities exchange or of any delisting thereof. SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust). The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by it. Such expenses may include the reasonable compensation and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, or take any remedial action under this Indenture, or to enter any appearance or in any way defend any suit in which it may be a defendant, or to take any steps in the execution of the trusts created hereby or thereby or in the enforcement of any rights and powers under this Indenture, until it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture, including compensation for services, costs, expenses, outlays, counsel fees and other disbursements, and against all liability not due to its negligence or willful misconduct. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any loss or liability incurred by it in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust and its duties hereunder as Trustee, Registrar and/or Paying Agent, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity; however, unless the position of the Company is prejudiced by such failure, the failure of the Trustee to promptly notify the Company shall not limit its right to indemnification. The Company shall defend each such claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may retain separate counsel and the Company shall reimburse the Trustee for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through negligence or willful misconduct. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to that of the Holders of the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Securities. Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6), the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law. -31-
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination, satisfaction or discharge of this Indenture. The Trustee, in its capacity as Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 7.07. SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent; (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as Trustee hereunder. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Securityholder. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee shall comply with TIA ss. 310(a)(5). SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust assets to, another corporation or association, the successor corporation or association without any further act -32-
shall be the successor Trustee; provided such corporation or association shall be otherwise eligible and qualified under this Article Seven. SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA ss. 310(a)(1).

public accounts delivered to the Trustee in case U.S. Government Obligations have been so deposited, to pay principal and interest on the Securities to maturity or repurchase, as the case may be. However, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 4.01, 4.04, 7.07 and 7.08 shall survive until the Securities are no longer outstanding.

U.S. Government Obligations shall not be callable at the issuer's option.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request of the Company executed by an Officer any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years and thereafter, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such money; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent before being required to make any such repayment may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or mail to each such Holder notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company. SECTION 8.04. Reinstatement, Indemnity. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental -34-
authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.01 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.01; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.01 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of outstanding Securities. ARTICLE NINE AMENDMENTS, SUPPLEMENTS AND WAIVERS SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders.

SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. Subject to Section 6.07, the Company, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, and the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities. However, -35-
without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.04, may not: (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (2) reduce the rate of or change or extend the time for payment of principal of or interest on any Security; (3) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Security; (4) waive a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security; (5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security; or (6) make any change in this Section, Section 6.04 or Section 6.07. Notwithstanding the above and Section 6.07, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance by the Company with Section 4.08 of this Indenture. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. Any, waiver shall be deemed effective upon receipt by the Trustee of the necessary consents and shall not require execution of any supplemental indenture to be effective. After an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice briefly describing the amendment or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, waiver, consent or supplemental indenture. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.02, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provisions of this Indenture or the Securities. SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect. SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, -36-
until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security. For such revocation to be effective, the Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (6) of Section 9.02. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security. SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. SECTION 9.06. Trustee Protected. The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine if the amendment or supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. If it does adversely affect the rights of the Trustee, the Trustee may, but need not sign it. In signing such amendment or supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Article Seven) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 10.04, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by and complies with this Indenture. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Board of Directors approves it. ARTICLE TEN MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.01. Trust Indenture Act Controls.
