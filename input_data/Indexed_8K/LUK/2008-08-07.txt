Exhibit 99.1 August 7, 2008 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Laura Ulbrandt (212) 460-1900 LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SIX MONTH 2008 RESULTS Leucadia National Corporation (LUK - NYSE) today announced its operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2008. During 2008, the Company recorded an adjustment that reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance and credited income tax expense by $222,200,000. The adjustment results from the Company's conclusion that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize that portion of the net deferred tax asset. Net income was $90,954,000 or $.39 per diluted common share for the six month period ended June 30, 2008 compared to net income of $34,673,000 or $.16 per diluted common share for the six month period ended June 30, 2007.
