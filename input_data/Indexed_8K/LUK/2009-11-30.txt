Capmark
) received approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to complete the sale of its North American servicing and mortgage banking businesses to Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (f/k/a Berkadia III, LLC) (

), a joint venture between Leucadia National Corporation and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  The sale will be pursuant to the previously disclosed Asset Put Agreement, as amended to increase the purchase price from $490 million to $515 million, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Asset Put Agreement, and to convert to cash the $75 million note portion of the purchase price related to the Fannie Mae DUS Program.  At closing, Leucadia currently estimates that it will make an equity contribution to Berkadia of approximately $215 million to fund its share of the purchase price.  
 
On November 30, 2009, Capmark exercised its put right under the Asset Put Agreement.  The closing of Berkadias acquisition of Capmarks mortgage servicing and mortgage banking business is subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions.
