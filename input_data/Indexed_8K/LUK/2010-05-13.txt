Item 5.02                      Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) and (f)
 
On May 10, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) awarded performance bonuses for 2009 of $2,000,000 (the 2009 Bonus) to each of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the Board and President, respectively, of the Company.  The 2009 Bonuses were awarded under the Companys shareholder approved 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the Bonus Plan), which provides for an annual incentive bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each year through 2014, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion.  Although the maximum amount of the bonus that could have been paid to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg under the Bonus Plan was $7,870,365, the Committee exercised its discretion and determined to pay only $2,000,000 to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg at this time. The Committee determined that it would, at an appropriate time in the future, re-consider whether to pay any of the remaining portion of the maximum 2009 bonus that could have been paid under the Bonus Plan.  The Bonus Plan is designed so that the cash bonuses awarded under it will qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
After giving effect to the 2009 Bonus, the amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table contained in the Companys Proxy Statement dated April 7, 2010 under the columns Bonus and Total would have increased by the amount of the 2009 Bonus for each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg.  As a result, total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2009 would have been $3,011,850 for Mr. Cumming and $3,184,338 for Mr. Steinberg.
