Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On August 9, 2010, Leucadia National Corporation (Leucadia or the Company) was advised that Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (FMG) is asserting that its subsidiary, Chichester Metals Pty Ltd (FMG Chichester), is entitled to issue additional subordinated notes in an unlimited amount identical to the $100,000,000 principal amount subordinated note of FMG Chichester held by Leucadia (the Leucadia Subordinated Note).  FMG further claims that any interest to be paid on additional subordinated notes can dilute, on a pro rata basis, Leucadias entitlement to the stated interest of 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from FMGs Cloud Break and Christmas Creek mine areas.
This extraordinary claim comes four years after the issuance to Leucadia of the Leucadia Subordinated Note, during which time FMG has never asserted this purported right to dilute Leucadias interest in any of FMGs public filings or other communications.  The Leucadia Subordinated Note was issued by FMG Chichester in August 2006 under a Note Deed Poll in the form set forth as a schedule to the July 15, 2006 Subscription Agreement among FMG, FMG Chichester and Leucadia, as amended (the Subscription Agreement).  Leucadia does not believe that FMG Chichester has the right to issue additional notes which affect Leucadias interest or that the interpretation by FMG of the terms of the Leucadia Subordinated Note, as currently claimed by FMG, reflects the agreement between the parties. &# 160;Leucadia is outraged that FMG and its chief executive officer, Andrew Forrest, now assert this claim.
Leucadia did not, and never would, agree to such dilution.  This was not bargained for in 2006, when Leucadias substantial investment in FMG through the Leucadia Subordinated Note and FMG shares enabled FMG to secure a $2 billion senior debt facility to finance its mining project. FMG and Forrest know full well that Leucadia invested in the Leucadia Subordinated Note upon the basis that the entire 4% belonged to Leucadia.
After attempting to convince FMGs Board of Directors not to lend their names and support to this position, on September 1, 2010, Leucadia filed a Writ of Summons against FMG, FMG Chichester and Andrew Forrest in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  The Writ of Summons seeks:
 
 
The Leucadia Subordinated Note has a maturity of 13 years from issuance, and is guaranteed by FMG.  Interest on the Leucadia Subordinated Note is equal to 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the projects Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas.  The Leucadia Subordinated Note is unsecured and subordinated to the projects senior secured debt.  Interest is payable semi-annually within 30 days of June 30 and December 31 of each year; however, cash interest payments on the Leucadia Subordinated Note had been deferred by FMG due to covenants contained in the projects senior secured de bt.  Any interest payment that was deferred earned simple interest at an annual rate of 9.5%.  On July 30, 2010, the Company received $154,900,000 (after withholding taxes) from FMG in payment of the accrued interest due through June 30, 2010.

If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to Leucadia and additional notes are issued, the Companys future cash flows from the Leucadia Subordinated Note and future results of operations would be materially and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.  At June 30, 2010, the Companys net investment in the Leucadia Subordinated Note was $203,500,000.  A copy of the form of Subscription Agreement, including the form of Note Deed Poll, was filed by Leucadia as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
