Item 8.01  Other Events.
Reference is made to the disclosure contained in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 filed by Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) concerning the Companys interest in Premier Entertainment Biloxi LLC, (Premier) and the ongoing litigation with certain former noteholders of Premier.  As disclosed, the Company had funded an escrow account to cover the Premier noteholders claim for additional damages in the amount of $13,700,000.
On September 3, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi awarded the Premier noteholders $9,600,000, plus interest at the federal judgment rate in effect on August 10, 2007 from that date until the date of payment, but in no event would the Premier noteholders be entitled to damages in an amount exceeding the amount held in the escrow account.  Any funds remaining in the escrow account after payment of the award are to be returned to the Company.
The Company is considering what if any further action should be taken with respect to this decision.
As a result of this decision, the Company will record a loss in the third quarter of 2010 for the award and interest, currently estimated to be $11,000,000.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
