(e) and (f)
 
As previously reported, on May 10, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) awarded performance bonuses for 2009 of $2,000,000 to each of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the Board and President, respectively, of the Company.  The 2009 Bonuses were awarded under the Companys shareholder approved 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the Bonus Plan), which provides for an annual incentive bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each year through 2014, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion.  Although the maximum amount of the bonus that could have been paid to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg under the Bonus Plan was $7,870,365, the Committee exercised its discretion and determined to pay only $2,000,000 to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg at that time in recognition of the fact that all of the Companys accounting income for 2009 resulted from unrealized gains attributable to increases in the market values of the common stock of two of the Companys investments, AmeriCredit Corp. and Jefferies Group, Inc., which are reflected directly in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.
 On October 5, 2010, the Compensation Committee awarded a further bonus to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg of $2,611,494 in recognition of the October 1, 2010 sale of all of the Companys interest in AmeriCredit and the resulting realization of a gain on that sale in excess of the unrealized gain on AmeriCredit reflected in the Companys 2009 audited pre-tax earnings.  In reaching this determination, the Committee considered that the $5,870,365  unpaid portion of the 2009 bonus awardable under the Bonus Plan (the Remaining 2009 Bonus) was attributable to unrealized gains relating to the Companys investment in AmeriCredit and Jefferies.  The Committee considered the relative values of the 2009 unrealized gains for these two investments and concluded that the Ame riCredit unrealized gain represented 44.48606% of the total of these unrealized gains.  Now that the gain on the Companys investment in AmeriCredit has been realized in excess of the unrealized gain reflected in the Companys 2009 financial statements, the Committee determined to award an additional portion of the Remaining 2009 Bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg.  The Committee also determined that it would, at an appropriate time in the future, re-consider whether to pay any of the balance of the Remaining 2009 Bonus and retained full discretion to consider all relevant and appropriate facts when determining whether to award some or all of the balance of the Remaining 2009 Bonus.
 
After giving effect to the aggregate $4,611,494 2009 bonus awarded to date under the Bonus Plan to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg, the amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table contained in the Companys Proxy Statement dated April 7, 2010 under the columns Bonus and Total would have increased by $4,611,494 for each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg.  As a result, total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2009 would have been $5,623,344 for Mr. Cumming and $5,795,832 for Mr. Steinberg.
