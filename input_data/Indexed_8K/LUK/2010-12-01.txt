Item 1.01       Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 29, 2010, Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary, MK Resources LLC, entered into agreements to sell to Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet) the Companys 30% indirect equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to the Cobre Las Cruces copper mining project located in southern Spain (Las Cruces).  Inmet, a Canadian company whose shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, currently owns the other 70% of Las Cruces.  The aggregate consideration for this transaction will be $480 million, consisting of $150 million in cash and Inmet common shares valued at $330 million based on the volume weighted average trading price of an Inmet common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the 10 day period ending November 26, 2010.& #160;  In addition, the Company will be released from its guarantee of $72 million of debt owed by Las Cruces to an affiliate of Inmet.  The Company currently owns approximately 9.98% of Inmets outstanding common shares, and after giving effect to this transaction, will own approximately 17.94% of Inmets common shares.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close by December 31, 2010.  The Company expects to report a gain upon consummation of this transaction based upon the trading price of the Inmet common shares on the closing date.  Using the closing price of an Inmet common share on November 29, 2010, that gain would be approximately $280 million.
Attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, are the Share Purchase Agreement among Inmet Mining Corporation, Leucadia National Corporation and MK Resources LLC (the Share Purchase Agreement) and the Note Purchase Agreement among Leucadia National Corporation, Inmet Mining Corporation and Inmet Finance Company SARL (the Note Purchase Agreement), each dated November 29, 2010.  Also attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by Leucadia dated November 29, 2010.
The Inmet shares to be issued in connection with the transaction will be subject to the terms of the existing registration rights agreement entered into between the Company and Inmet in 2005, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereof.

6.4                      Exclusive Remedies

6.7                      Notice of and Defence of Third Party Claims
 
(1)           If an Indemnified Party receives written notice of the commencement or assertion of any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party believes the Indemnifying Party has liability under this Agreement, the
 
 
21
 
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the initial notice of such Third Party Claim, unless a shorter procedural period applies in respect of such Third Party Claim, in which case notice shall be given before the expiry of one half of such period.  To the extent reasonable and practical given the information readily available to the Indemnified Party, such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate (without prejudice to the Indemnified Partys rights) the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice within such time period shall no t reduce the Indemnified Partys rights hereunder, except to the extent of any actual prejudice suffered as a result of such failure.
 
(2)           The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim and subject to the rights of any insurer or other Third Party having potential liability therefor, to elect to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys own expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim: (i) alleging any criminal or quasi-criminal wrongdoing (including fraud), (ii) which impugns the reputation of the Indemnified Party or (iii) where the Third Party making the Third Party Claim is a Governmental Body.< /font>
 
(3)           Prior to settling or compromising any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume the defence, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the consent of the Indemnified Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnified Party.  In addition, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defence of any Third Party Claim (and in so doing may retain its own counsel) at the cost and expense of the Indemnified Party.  If the Indemnified Party does not consent to a settlement or compromise in respect of a Third Party Claim proposed by the Indemnifying Party, and the Losses in respect of such Third Party Claim, as det ermined by a final, non-appealable order or judgment, exceed the amount of Losses under the proposed settlement or compromise (the Settlement Amount), then the indemnification to which the Indemnified Party is entitled under this Article 6 in respect of such Third Party Claim shall equal the Settlement Amount.
 
(4)           With respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party has given notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7 and in respect of which the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defence or has not elected to do so, the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) such defence assisted by counsel of its own choosing at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense and, prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall obtain the consent of the
 
 
22
 
Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.
 
(5)           At their own cost and expense, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to make available to the Party which is undertaking and controlling the defence of any Third Party Claim:
 
 
 
and shall otherwise co-operate with the Party defending such Third Party Claim.
 
(6)           If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section 6.7(2) and fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within 30 days after receiving notice from the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party bona fide believes on reasonable grounds that the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnified Party may, at its option, elect to assume the defence of and to compromise or settle the Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choosing and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith; provided, that prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have obtained the consent of the Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.
 
(7)           Upon making a full Loss Payment, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the rights of any insurers and to the extent of such Loss Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the Loss Payment relates.
 
(8)           Any Person providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an Indemnifying Party, and any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an Indemnified Party.
 
6.8                      Calculation of Damages
 
   The Losses suffered by any Party hereto shall be calculated after giving effect to the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any recoveries from third parties, including insurance recoveries (it being understood and agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall not be required to seek insurance recoveries in respect of Losses to be indemnified hereunder), and shall take into account any Tax effects.  In the event any
 
 
23
 
insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of a Loss Payment hereunder in respect of the Claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such Loss Payment.
 
6.9                      Mitigation
 
   The Seller Parties and Inmet shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any Claim or Loss with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Claim or Loss.
 
6.10                      No Duplication
 
   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Article 6 shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Losses.
 
6.11                      Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments
 
   The Seller Parties and Inmet agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 6 as an adjustment to the purchase price for all income tax purposes.
 
 
7.1                      Public Announcements and Confidential Information
 
(1)           No public announcement or press release concerning the sale and purchase of the Purchased Shares shall be made by any of the Seller Parties or Inmet except as may be required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which their respective shares are listed.  Each Party Group will advise and consult with the other prior to any such required announcement or disclosure.
 
(2)           The Seller Parties shall, and shall procure that each Member of the Leucadia Group shall, keep all Confidential Information confidential and will not, without the prior written consent of Inmet (subject to Section 7.1(3)), disclose in any manner, in whole or in part, or use, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information for any purpose except in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller Parties shall advise the shareholders, directors, officer, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives of the Members of the Leucadia Group who possess Confidential Information of the obligation to keep such Confidential Information confidential.
 
(3)           The Seller Parties may disclose Confidential Information if required by Applicable Law or requested by legal process or regulatory authority to do so. If any of the Seller Parties is required by Applicable Law or requested by legal
 
 
24
 
process or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, such Party will give prompt notice to Inmet of that fact so that Inmet may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Agreement and, further, such Party will co-operate in any efforts to obtain a protective order or other remedy at the expense of the Party or Parties such protective order or remedy.  If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or compliance with this Agreement is waived, such Party will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is required or requested.
 
(4)           Each of the Seller Parties and Inmet acknowledges that the other Party Group may not have an adequate remedy at law for damages and would be irreparably harmed if the covenants contained in this Section 7.1 are not performed.  Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies they may have in law or equity, the other Party Group is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of, and to specifically enforce, this Section 7.1.
 
7.2                      Information for Reporting Requirements

Inmet will advise Leucadia prior to taking any changes to its capitalization which reasonably could be expected to raise Leucadias interest in Inmet to 20% or mo re (or such lower percentage such that Leucadia would be required to provide information as to Inmet in order for Leucadia to be in compliance with the SEC requirements under Applicable Law at the relevant time), and, prior to effecting or agreeing to effect any such changes to Inmets capitalization, Inmet will permit Leucadia to reduce its interest in Inmet below the relevant threshold or, to the extent such reduction is not possible at the relevant time, delay the proposed change in Inmets capitalization until such time as the reduction of Leucadias interest can be completed.
 
7.3                      Further Assurances
 
   Each of the Parties shall from time to time execute and deliver all such further documents and instruments and do all acts and things as any other Party may, either before or after the Closing Date, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement.

   Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
 
 
25
 
7.5                      Dispute Resolution
 
   When any dispute arises, management of each of the Parties shall meet and confer in a good faith effort to resolve the same.  If the dispute cannot be resolved within two weeks,  the Chief Executive Officer of each of the Parties shall meet and confer in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute.  If the dispute cannot be resolved within two weeks from the time it is referred to the Chief Executive Officers, the Parties agree to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation or some other dispute resolution procedure.
 
7.6                      Fees and Expenses
 
   Each of the Parties shall pay their respective legal, accounting and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and all documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto and any other costs and expenses whatsoever and howsoever incurred.

7.8                      Invalidity of Provisions

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Parties waive any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable in any respect.
 
7.9                      Entire Agreement
 
   This Agreement, together with the Transaction Documents and the Registration Rights Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and cancel and supersede any prior understandings and agreements between the Parties with respect thereto.  There are no representations, warranties, terms, conditions, undertakings or collateral agreements, express, implied or statutory, between the Parties other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
 
7.10                    Amendments and Waiver
 
   No modification of or amendment to this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Parties and no waiver of any breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall be effective or binding unless made in writing and signed by the Party purporting to give the same and, unless otherwise provided, shall be limited to the specific breach waived.
 
 
26
 
 
7.11                    Assignment
 
   This Agreement may not be assigned by a Party without the written consent of the other Parties, except to an Affiliate of the assigning Party, provided that such Affiliate enters into a written agreement with the other Parties to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement in all respects and to the same extent as the assigning Party is bound and provided that the assigning Party shall continue to be bound by all the obligations hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and perform such obligations to the extent that such Affiliate fails to do so.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Inmet shall not be relieved of its obligation to issue the Inmet Consideration Shares following any permitted assignment by Inmet hereunder.

(2)        If any term, covenant or condition to be performed, satisfied or complied with by the Purchaser Parties for the benefit of Leucadia shall not have been performed or complied with in all material respects by the Termination Date, and such failure to perform, satisfy or comply would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1(1), Leucadia may, without limiting any other right that they may have, at their sole option, either:
 
 
 
4.3                    Procedure for Satisfaction of the Conditions
 
                      Each of the Parties undertakes to use all commercially reasonable endeavours to ensure the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 over which it has control as promptly as possible.
 
4.4                    Termination; Effect of Termination

For as long as Leucadia or an Affiliate is a shareholder of Inmet, if Inmet becomes aware that it is a PFIC or a CFC, Inmet shall promptly notify Leucadia.

6.4                    Exclusive Remedies
 
Following the Closing, the rights of indemnification set out in this Article 6 and Section 4.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties under or in connection with this Agreement and shall be exclusive of all other remedies to which such parties would otherwise be entitled at law or in equity.

6.5                    Limitation of Liability of Leucadia
 
(1)        Leucadia shall not have any liability in respect of any Claim made by the Purchaser Parties arising out of any breach of any covenant of Leucadia contained in this Agreement or from any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in any representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.1 or any Claim for indemnification hereunder unless and until the liability of Leucadia in respect of that Claim, when aggregated with the liability of Leucadia in respect of all other such Claims exceeds $2,000,000, in which event Leucadia shall be liable for the full amount of such Claims.
 
(2)        The aggregate liability of Leucadia in respect of all Claims under this Agreement shall not in any circumstances exceed $20,000,000.

(2)        The aggregate liability of the Purchaser Parties in respect of all Claims under this Agreement shall not in any circumstances exceed $20,000,000.
 
6.7                    Notice of and Defence of Third Party Claims
 
(1)        If an Indemnified Party receives written notice of the commencement or assertion of any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party believes the Indemnifying Party has liability under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the initial notice of such Third Party Claim, unless a shorter procedural period applies in respect of such Third Party Claim, in which case notice shall be given before the expiry of one half of such period.  To the extent reasonable and practical given the information readily available to the Indemnified Party, such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detai l and shall indicate (without prejudice to the Indemnified Partys rights) the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice within such time period shall not reduce the Indemnified Partys rights hereunder, except to the extent of any actual prejudice suffered as a result of such failure.
 
(2)        The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim and subject to the rights of any insurer or other Third Party having potential liability therefor, to elect to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys own expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim: (i) alleging any criminal or quasi-criminal wrongdoing (including fraud), (ii) which impugns the reputation of the Indemnified Party or (iii) where the Third Party making the Third Party Claim is a Governmental Body.
 
(3)        Prior to settling or compromising any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume the defence, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the consent of the Indemnified Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnified Party.  In addition, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defence of any Third Party Claim (and in so doing may retain its own counsel) at the cost and expense of the Indemnified Party.  If the Indemnified Party does not consent to a settlement or compromise in respect of a Third Party Claim proposed by the Indemnifying Party, and the Losses in respect of such Third Party Claim, as determined by a final , non-appealable order or judgment, exceed the amount of Losses under the proposed settlement or compromise (the Settlement Amount), then the indemnification to which the Indemnified Party is entitled under this Article 6 in respect of such Third Party Claim shall equal the Settlement Amount.
 
 
22
 
(4)        With respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party has given notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7 and in respect of which the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defence or has not elected to do so, the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) such defence assisted by counsel of its own choosing at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense and, prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall obtain the consent of the Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.
 
(5)        At their own cost and expense, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to make available to the Party which is undertaking and controlling the defence of any Third Party Claim:
 
 
 
and shall otherwise co-operate with the Party defending such Third Party Claim.
 
(6)        If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defence of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section 6.7(2) and fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within 30 days after receiving notice from the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party bona fide believes on reasonable grounds that the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnified Party may, at its option, elect to assume the defence of and to compromise or settle the Third Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choosing and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith; provided, that prior to settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have obtain ed the consent of the Indemnifying Party regarding such settlement or compromise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed by the Indemnifying Party.
 
(7)        Upon making a full Loss Payment, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the rights of any insurers and to the extent of such Loss Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the Loss Payment relates.
 
(8)        Any Person providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an Indemnifying Party, and any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6 is referred to herein as an Indemnified Party.
 
 
23
 
6.8                   Calculation of Damages
 
The Losses suffered by any Party hereto shall be calculated after giving effect to the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any recoveries from third parties, including insurance recoveries (it being understood and agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall not be required to seek insurance recoveries in respect of Losses to be indemnified hereunder), and shall take into account any Tax effects.  In the event any insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of a Loss Payment hereunder in respect of the Claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such Loss Payment.
 
6.9                   Mitigation
 
Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any Claim or Loss with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Claim or Loss.
 
6.10                 No Duplication
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Article 6 shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Losses.
 
6.11                 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments
 
Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 6 as an adjustment to the purchase price for all income tax purposes.

24

(3)        Leucadia may disclose Confidential Information if required by Applicable Law or requested by legal process or regulatory authority to do so.  If Leucadia is required by Applicable Law or requested by legal process or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, it will give prompt notice to Inmet of that fact so that Inmet may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Agreement and, further, such Party will co-operate in any efforts to obtain a protective order or other remedy at the expense of the Party or Parties such protective order or remedy.  If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or compliance with this Agreement is waived, such Party will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information whi ch is required or requested.
 
(4)        Each of Leucadia and the Purchaser Parties acknowledges that the other Party Group may not have an adequate remedy at law for damages and would be irreparably harmed if the covenants contained in this Section 7.1 are not performed.  Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies they may have in law or equity, the other Party Group is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of, and to specifically enforce, this Section 7.1.

Inmet will advise Leucadia prior to taking any changes to its capitalization which reasonably could be expected to raise Leucadias interest in Inmet to 20% or more (or such l ower percentage such that Leucadia would be required to provide information as to Inmet in order for Leucadia to be in compliance with the SEC requirements under Applicable Law at the relevant time), and, prior to effecting or agreeing to effect any such changes to Inmets capitalization, Inmet will permit Leucadia to reduce its interest in Inmet below the relevant threshold or, to the extent such reduction is not possible at the relevant time, delay the proposed change in Inmets capitalization until such time as the reduction of Leucadias interest can be completed.

7.8                    Invalidity of Provisions

7.9                    Entire Agreement

7.11                  Assignment
 
This Agreement may not be assigned by a Party without the written consent of the other Parties, except to an Affiliate of the assigning Party, provided that such Affiliate enters into a written agreement with the other Parties to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement in all respects and to the same extent as the assigning Party is bound and provided that the assigning Party shall continue to be bound by all the obligations hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and perform such obligations to the extent that such Affiliate fails to do so.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Inmet shall not be relieved of its obligation to issue the Inmet Consideration Shares following any permitted assignment by Inmet hereunder.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact:
Laura Ulbrandt (212) 460-1900
 
 
 
 
Leucadia National Corporation (LUK  NYSE) announced today that it has reached a binding agreement with Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet) (IMN  TSX) providing for the acquisition by Inmet of Leucadias 30% indirect equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to the Cobre Las Cruces copper mining project (Las Cruces) for total value of US$480 million.  The purchase consideration will be comprised of US$150 million cash and 5,442,413 newly issued common shares of Inmet valued at US$330 million (the Consideration Shares), based on the volume weighted average trading price of an Inmet common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the 10 day period ending November 26, 2010.  In addition, Leucadia will be released from its guarantee of US$72 million of debt owed by Las Cruces to an affiliate of Inmet.  Leucadia expects to report a gain upon consummation of this transaction based upon the trading price of the Inmet common shares on the closing date.  Using the closing price of an Inmet common share on November 29, 2010, that gain would be approximately US$280 million.
 
When issued, the Consideration Shares will constitute approximately 8.8% of the then outstanding Inmet common shares.  On completion of the transaction, Leucadia will beneficially own 11,042,413 common shares of Inmet common shares, or approximately 17.94% of Inmets issued and outstanding common shares.  These shares will be subject to the current registration rights agreement between Inmet and Leucadia which was previously publicly disclosed.  Closing of the transaction is subject to a number of customary conditions, including receipt of TSX approval.
 
The Consideration Shares are valued at US$330 million, which, based on the Bank of Canada noon exchange rate expressed in Canadian dollars per US$1.00 on November 26, 2010, is equal to approximately C$61.79 per share.
 
The Consideration Shares, if and when issued, will be acquired for investment purposes only, and Leucadia has no current intention of acquiring any further securities of Inmet. Depending upon relevant economic and market conditions prevailing from time to time, Leucadia may determine to acquire or to dispose of common shares of Inmet in TSX traded or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Leucadia disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
