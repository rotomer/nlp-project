Leucadia National Corporation (LUK  NYSE) announced today the closing of the transaction detailed in a press release dated November 29, 2010 with Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet) (IMN  TSX) whereby Inmet acquired Leucadias 30% indirect equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to the Cobre Las Cruces copper mining project (Las Cruces).  The purchase consideration was effectively comprised of US$150 million cash and 5,442,413 newly issued common shares of Inmet (the Consideration Shares). In addition, Leucadia was released from its guarantee of US$72 million of debt owed by Las Cruces to an affiliate of Inmet.
 
The Consideration Shares constitute approximately 8.8% of the outstanding Inmet common shares.  Accordingly, for purposes of Canadian securities laws, Leucadia beneficially owns 11,042,413 common shares of Inmet, or approximately 17.94% of Inmets currently issued and outstanding common shares.
 
The number of common shares issued by Inmet in the transaction was based on the volume weighted average trading price of an Inmet common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the 10 day period ending November 26, 2010.  Based on the Bank of Canada noon exchange rate expressed in Canadian dollars per US$1.00 on November 26, 2010, the per share value of the Consideration on November 26, 2010 was equal to approximately C$61.79 per share.
 
The Consideration Shares were acquired for investment purposes only, and Leucadia has no current intention of acquiring any further securities of Inmet. Depending upon relevant economic and market conditions prevailing from time to time, Leucadia may determine to acquire or to dispose of common shares of Inmet in TSX-traded or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
