On March 29, 2011, Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet) announced that its pending merger with Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin), pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated January 12, 2011 (the Inmet-Lundin Arrangement), has been mutually terminated in accordance with its terms.  Inmet is a Canadian company whose shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  In announcing the termination, both Inmet and Lundin stated that they have agreed that Inmet's right to a break fee of $120 million, in accordance with the arrangement agreement, will be preserved in connection with the unsolicited offer of Equinox Minerals Limited to acquire Lundin.
As a result of the termination of the Inmet-Lundin Arrangement, the previously disclosed voting and support agreement between Leucadia National Corporation and Lundin in support of the Inmet-Lundin Arrangement has automatically terminated.
