The Company shall distribute to all Members prior to the tenth (10th) day before the due date of the federal quarterly estimated tax payments an aggregate amount equal to the Base Tax Rate times the allocations of taxable income made or expected to be made pursuant to this Article 5 for such quarter (the ).  The Board of Managers shall determine the amount to be distributed to the Members pursuant to this Section 5.2.1 in its reasonable discretion based on such reasonable assumptions as the Board of Managers determines in good faith to be appropriate.  Tax Distributions shall be divided among the Members pro rata in accordance with their Percentage Interests.  The Base Tax Rate shall be equal to fifty-four percent (54%).  The Board of Managers shall consider adjusting the Base Tax Rate to be above 54% if requested by a Member upon a determination that the federal and state tax rates affecting the Member (or the Members taxpayers) have increased by more than

1%; provided, however, the Board of Managers shall have no obligation to increase the Base Tax Rate.  For purposes of computing taxable income under this Section 5.2.1, taxable income shall be determined without taking account the effect of any benefit to a Member under Section 743(b) or 734(b) of the Code.
 
5.3
 
.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make a Distribution to any Member on account of such Members Interest in the Company if such Distribution would violate Section 18-607 of the Act or other applicable law.
No Violation
 
5.4
 
.  The Board of Managers is authorized to withhold from Distributions to Members, or with respect to allocations to Members and in each case to pay over to the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign government any amounts required by law to be so withheld.  All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any federal, state, local or foreign tax law with respect to any payment, distribution or allocation to the Company shall be treated as amounts paid to the Company and each Member shall be treated as having received a distribution pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof equal to the portion of the withholding tax allocable to such Member, as determined by the Board of Managers.  Any taxes withheld on a payment to the Company or a payment by the Company to a Member pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be treated as if distributed to the relevant Member to the extent that an amount equal to such withheld taxes would then be distributable to such Member, and, to the extent in excess of such distributable amounts, as a demand loan payable by the Member to the Company with interest at the prime rate in effect from time to time plus two percent (2%), compounded annually.  The Board of Managers may, in its sole discretion, either demand payment of the principal and accrued interest on such demand loan at any time, and enforce payment thereof by legal process, or withhold from one or more distributions to a Member amounts sufficient to satisfy such Members obligations under any demand loan payable to the Company.  In the event that the Company receives a refund of taxes previously withheld by a third party from one (1) or more payments to the Company, the economic benefit of such refund shall be apportioned among the Members in a manner reasonably determined by the Board of Managers to offset the prior operation of this Section 5.4 in respect of such withheld taxes.  Promptly upon request, each Member shall provide the Company with any information related to such Member that is necessary (i) to allow the Company to comply with any tax reporting, tax withholding, or tax payment obligations of the Company or (ii) to establish the Companys legal entitlement to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax, including U.S. federal withholding tax under Sections 1471 and 1472 of the Code.  As a security for any withholding tax or other liability or obligation to which the Company may be subject as a result of any act or status of any Member, or to which the Company may become subject with respect to the Interest of any Member, the Company shall have (and each Member hereby grants to the Company) a security interest in all distributable assets of the Company distributable to such Member to the extent of the amount of such withholding tax or other liability or obligation.  Neither the Company nor the Board of Managers shall be liable for any excess taxes withheld in respect of any Members Interest, and, in the event of overwithholding, a Members sole recourse shall be to apply for a refund from the appropriate governmental authority.  If the Company, the Board of Managers, the Tax Matters Member, or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, managers, members and, as determined by the Board of Managers in its sole and absolute discretion, consultants or agents (the  and each a

), becomes liable as a result of failure to withhold and remit taxes in respect of any Member, then, in addition to, and without limiting, any indemnities for which such Member may be liable under this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the Board of Managers in writing, such Member shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Withholding Indemnified Parties, in respect of all taxes, including interest and penalties, and any expenses incurred in any examination, determination, resolution and payment of such liability, except with respect to any penalties or expenses which arise as a result of any act or omission with respect to which a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, nonappealable judgment that such applicable Withholding Indemnified Party was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct or fraud.  The provisions contained in this Section 5.4 shall survive the termination of the Company and the Transfer of any Interest.
Withholding Indemnified Party
 
5.5
 
.  If any assets of the Company shall be distributed in kind pursuant to this Article 5, such assets shall be distributed to the Members entitled thereto in the same proportions as the Members would have been entitled to cash Distributions.  The amount by which the fair market value of any property to be distributed in kind to the Members exceeds or is less than the then prevailing Asset Value of such property shall, to the extent not otherwise recognized by the Company, be taken into account in determining Net Profit and Net Loss and determining the Capital Accounts of the Members as if such property had been sold at its fair market value immediately prior to such Distribution.  If any assets are sold in transactions in which, by reason of Section 453 of the Code, gain is realized but not recognized, such gain shall be taken into account when realized in computing gain or loss of the Company for purposes of allocation of Net Profit or Net Loss under this Article 5 and, if such sales shall involve substantially all the assets of the Company, the Company shall be deemed to have been dissolved and terminated notwithstanding any election by the Members to continue the Company for purposes of collecting the proceeds of such sales.

For purposes of the foregoing hypothetical sale described in Section 5.6.2(a)(i) above, all assets and liabilities of any entity that is wholly-owned by the Company and disregarded as an entity separate from the Company for federal income tax purposes shall be treated as assets and liabilities of the Company.
 
(b)
 
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6.2(b), the amount of items of Company expense and loss allocated pursuant to this Section 5.6.2(b) to any Member shall not exceed the maximum amount of such items that can be so allocated without causing such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year, unless each Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.  All such items in excess of the limitation set forth in this Section 5.6.2(b) shall be allocated first, to Members who would not have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, pro rata, in proportion to their Capital Account balances, adjusted as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, until no Member would be entitled to any further allocation, and thereafter, to all voting Members, pro rata, in proportion to their ownership of voting Interests.

5.7
 
.  Although the Members do not anticipate that events will arise that will require application of this Section 5.7, provisions governing the allocation of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (and items thereof) are included in this Agreement as may be necessary to provide that the Companys allocation provisions contain a so-called Qualified Income Offset and comply with all provisions relating to the allocation of (i) Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain and the chargeback thereof as set forth in the Regulations under Section 704(b) of the Code  and (ii) so-called Nonrecourse Deductions and Member Nonrecourse Deductions (clauses (i) and (ii) together, the ); , , that the Members intend that all Regulatory Allocations that may be required shall be offset by other Regulatory Allocations or special allocations of items so that each Members share of the Net Profit, Net Loss and capital of the Company will be the same as it would have been had the events requiring the Regulatory Allocations not occurred.  For this purpose the Board of Managers, based on the advice of the Companys auditors or tax counsel, is hereby authorized to make such special curative allocations of tax items as may be necessary to minimize or eliminate any economic distortions that may result from any required Regulatory Allocations.

Maximum Interest
 
No agreements, conditions, provisions or stipulations contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents, or any Matured Default, or any exercise by the Agent of the right to accelerate the payment of the maturity of principal and interest, or to exercise any
 
 
85
 
option whatsoever, contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, or the arising of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle the Agent to collect, in any event, interest exceeding the Highest Lawful Rate, and in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to pay interest exceeding the Highest Lawful Rate, and all agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel the Borrower to pay a rate of interest exceeding the Highest Lawful Rate, shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only of the excess of interest over such Highest Lawful Rate.  In the event any interest is charged in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate (), the Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge shall be the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and such Excess shall be, first, applied to reduce the principal of any Liabilities due, and, second, returned to the Borrower, it being the intention of the parties hereto not to enter at any time into a usurious or otherwise illegal relationship.  The Borrower and the Agent both recognize that, with fluctuations in the Base Rate and the LIBOR Rate, such an unintentional result could inadvertently occur.  By the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower covenants that (a) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by the Borrower of such Excess and (b) the Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the Agent, any Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or the Lenders based, in whole or in part, upon the charging or receiving of any interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, any Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or the Lenders (as the case may be), all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received by the Agent, the Issuers, the Swing Line Lender or the Lenders in connection with the Liabilities shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts during the entire term of this Agreement.

Each Lender and each Issuer agrees to notify the Agent promptly after any such setoff and application made by such Lender or Issuer; , , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

Disproportionate payments of interest shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid interest obligations, disproportionate payments of fees shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid fee obligations, and disproportionate payments of principal shall be shared by the purchase of separate participation in unpaid principal obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing National Beef shall have no obligation to purchase Force Majeure Cattle unless the logistics and financial components of purchasing the Force Majeure Cattle (such as delivery to another plant within a reasonable distance to the plant affected by the force majeure event) would be substantially the same to National Beef as they would have been without the occurrence of the force majeure event.  National Beef shall notify USPB in writing if National Beef will not purchase Force Majeure Cattle and take delivery at a plant with a force majeure event and must offer to purchase the Force Majeure Cattle with pricing adjustments to compensate National Beef for the actual additional costs to purchase the Force Majeure Cattle over the purchase of the Force Majeure Cattle if the force majeure event had not occurred.
