FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact:  Laura Ulbrandt  (212) 460-1900
Leucadia National Corporation (LUK  NYSE) today announced its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Net income attributable to Leucadia National Corporation common shareholders was $25,231,000 ($.10 per diluted common share) for 2011 compared to net income of $1,939,312,000 ($7.85 per diluted common share) for 2010.  Net income for 2010 included an adjustment to reduce income tax expense by $1,157,111,000, resulting from the Companys conclusion that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize that portion of its net deferred tax asset.  Net income attributable to Leucadia National Corporation common shareholders for 2011 and 2010 also included income from discontinued operations, including gain on disposal of $8,262,000 or $.03 per diluted common share and $51,149,000 or $.19 per diluted common share.
For more information on the Companys results of operations for 2011, please see the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
