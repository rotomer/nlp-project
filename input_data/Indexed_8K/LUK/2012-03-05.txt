EXHIBIT 99.1
On December 30, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of 78.9% of National Beef for aggregate net cash consideration of $867,869,000 (the "Acquisition"), pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) among the Company, National Beef, U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (USPB), NBPCo Holdings, LLC (NBPCo), TKK Investments, LLC (TKK), TMKCo, LLC (TMKCo) and TMK Holdings (TMK).  The Agreement provided that the following transactions occur in sequence on the closing date and are reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the Pro Forma Financial Statement) is presented to reflect the Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2011.  Historically, National Beefs fiscal year has consisted of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the last Saturday in August, while the Companys fiscal year is the calendar year.  In order to prepare the Pro Forma Financial Statement, National Beefs historical consolidated operating results for the 52 week period ending November 26, 2011 were added to the Companys historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The preparation of pro forma financial information is governed by Article 11 of Regulation S-X, which requires a recasting of National Beefs fiscal year end to a date that is within 93 days of the Companys year end.
The accompanying Pro Forma Financial Statement should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and the audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of National Beef, which were previously filed on the Companys Current Report on Form 8K/A on February 13, 2012.  The Pro Forma Financial Statement is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of actual results had the foregoing transactions occurred as described above, nor does it purport to represent results of future operations.
 
The has been prepared based upon a preliminary purchase price allocation for National Beef.  Differences between the preliminary and final purchase price allocation, if any, could result in adjustments to acquired working capital amounts and offsetting adjustments to goodwill.
