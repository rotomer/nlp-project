EXHIBIT 3.1
ARTICLE I.     SHAREHOLDERS MEETING
Section 1.                      The annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other place within or without the State of New York, on such date and at such time as shall be determined by the Board of Directors in each year for the purpose of electing Directors, and for the transaction of such other business as may be brought before the meeting.
Section 2.                      Special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors.
Section 3.                      Written notice of meetings of shareholders shall be given whenever shareholders are to take any action at a meeting.  Such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, unless it is the annual meeting, indicate that it is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting shall, in addition, state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting was called.
A copy of the notice of any meeting shall be given, personally or by mail, not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the meeting, to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the record of shareholders, or, if he shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that such notices to him be mailed to some other address, then directed to him at such other address.
Section 4.                      For the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to or dissent from any proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any rights, or for the purpose of any other action, the Board shall fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders.  Such date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.
Section 5.                      Except as may be otherwise required by laws of the State of New York, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders for the transaction of any business, provided that when a specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class or a series, voting as a class, the holders of a majority of shares of such class or series present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such specified item of business.
 
 
 
Section 6.                      In order to properly submit any business to an annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must give timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation of such shareholder's intention to present such business.  To be considered timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered, either in person or by United States certified mail, postage prepaid, and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation, not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary date of the Corporation's proxy statement in connection with the last Annual Meeting or if no Annual Meeting was held in the previous year, not less than a reasonable time, as determined by the Board of Directors, prior to the date of the applicable Annual Meeting.
Each notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder and his or her nominees, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is entitled to vote at such meeting, indicating the number of shares owned of record and beneficially by such shareholder, together with a statement that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present such proposal or proposals, (iii) a description of the proposal or proposals to be presented, including the complete text of any resolutions to be presented at the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in the business to be submitted at the meeting.  In addition, the shareholder shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation.
The presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a proposal was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective proposal shall be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a shareholder who seeks to have any proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement shall comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
ARTICLE II.                 DIRECTORS
Section 1.                      The number of the Directors of the Corporation shall be such number not less than three, as is designated from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, plus the number of Directors, if any, elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a class, pursuant to Section 5 of the General Provisions Relating to All Series of the Preferred Stock in Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.  The terms of the Directors, if any, elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a class, pursuant to Section 5 of the General Provisions Relating to All Series of the Preferred Stock in Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be as set forth in such Section 5. The Directors other than those, if any, elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall, except as otherwise set forth herein, be elected for one year terms which shall expire at each annual meeting of shareholders and when their successors shall have been elected and qualified.  Such election shall be by ballot by the shareholders entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy at such meeting.  In case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors (including any vacancy due to an increase in the size of the Board of Directors), the remaining Directors, although less than a quorum, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, may elect a successor to fill such vacancy to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and when such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.  Any Director or Directors (other than a Director or Directors elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 of the General Provisions Relating to All Series of the Preferred Stock in Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation) may be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present (including by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment) at a meeting at which such action is considered, provided a quorum is present.

Section 2.                      Nominations for the election of Directors may be made by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors (or, in the absence of such committee, by the Board of Directors) or by any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors.  However, any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if written notice of such shareholder's intention to make such nomination or nominations has been given, to the Secretary of the Corporation, either by personal delivery or by-United States certified mail, postage prepaid, and received at the principal executive office of the Corporation (1) with respect to an election to be held at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, (a) not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary date of the Corporation's proxy statement in connection with the last Annual Meeting or (b) if no Annual Meeting was held in the previous year, not less than a reasonable time, as determined by the Board of Directors, prior to the date of the applicable Annual Meeting and (2) with respect to an election to be held at a Special Meeting of Shareholders, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to shareholders.
Each such notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder and his or her nominees; (ii) a representation that the shareholder is entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each such nominee; (iv) such other information as would be required to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the nominees of such shareholder; and (v) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation if so elected.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation.  The presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Section 3.                      The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of their meetings and management of the affairs of the Corporation, as they may deem proper, not inconsistent with the laws of the State of New York, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
