The shareholder approved 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, as amended (the Bonus Plan) of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) provides for an annual incentive bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each year through 2014, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, in its sole discretion.  On May 15, 2012, the Compensation Committee awarded performance bonuses for 2011 under the Bonus Plan of $1,073,763 (the 2011 Bonus) to each of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the Board and President, respectively.  The 2011 Bonus equaled 1.35% of the audited consolidated pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
 
After giving effect to the 2011 Bonus for Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg, the amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table contained in the Companys Proxy Statement dated April 13, 2012 under the columns Bonus and Total would have increased by the amount of the 2011 Bonus for each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg.  As a result, total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2011 would have been $29,250,974 for Mr. Cumming and $29,218,901 for Mr. Steinberg.  These amounts include the grant date fair value of $26,697,578 of warrants granted to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in 2011 pursuant to the terms of the 2011 Warrant Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders.  The fair value of the warrants is required to be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily reflective of the compensation that will actually be realized by the warrant holder upon exercise, which could differ substantially from the fair value indicated above.  For information on the valuation assumptions with respect to the grants made in 2011, refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
