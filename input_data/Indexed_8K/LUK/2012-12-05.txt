Item 8.01.       Other Events.
As previously reported in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012, in the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Keen Energy Services, LLC (Keen), and reflected Keen as a discontinued operation.  The sale closed in October 2012.  In addition, effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.  This new accounting guidance eliminated the previous option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity; instead, it requires the presentation of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  This new accounting guidance was applied retrospectively.  Adoption of this new accounting guidance changed the presentation of the Companys consolidated financial statements but did not have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The exhibits attached below in this Form 8-K have been provided to reflect changes attributable to the two items discussed above on the Companys historical financial information and disclosures included in the following sections of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the 2011 10-K), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 27, 2012:
Accordingly, these revised sections include only those changes necessary to reflect Keen as a discontinued operation and the adoption of the new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.  The information in the exhibits attached hereto does not reflect any other events or developments that have occurred subsequent to February 27, 2012.  Without limiting the foregoing, this filing does not purport to update Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the 2011 Form 10-K for any information, uncertainties, transactions, risks, events or trends occurring, or known to management.  More current information is included in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 and other filings with the SEC.  This Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the 2011 10-K and such quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other filings.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Financial Information about Segments of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) included in this Exhibit 99.1 has been revised to reflect Keen Energy Services, LLC (Keen) as a discontinued operation in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  All other information included in this exhibit remains unchanged and does not reflect any other events or developments that have occurred subsequent to February 27, 2012.  More current information is included in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.4 and 99.5, respectively.
.                      
Item 1
Business.
Financial Information about Segments
The Companys reportable segments consist of the consolidated operating units identified above, which offer different products and services and are managed separately.  Other operations primarily consist of the Companys wineries and energy projects.  As a result of the classification of Keen Energy Services, LLC (Keen) as a discontinued operation, the Company no longer has an oil and gas drilling services segment.
Associated companies include equity interests in other entities that the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting.  Investments in associated companies that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting include HomeFed Corporation (HomeFed), a corporation engaged in real estate activities, Linkem S.p.A. (Linkem), a wireless broadband services provider in Italy, JHYH, Berkadia and Garcadia, a joint venture that owns automobile dealerships.  Associated companies also include the Companys investments in Jefferies and Mueller which are accounted for at fair value rather than under the equity method of accounting.
Corporate assets primarily consist of the deferred tax asset, investments and cash and cash equivalents and corporate revenues primarily consist of investment and other income and securities gains and losses.  Corporate assets include the Companys investment in Fortescue and in the common shares of Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet), a Canadian-based global mining company.  Corporate assets, revenues, overhead expenses and interest expense are not allocated to the operating units.
Conwed Plastics has a manufacturing and sales facility located in Belgium, National Beef has sales offices in and exports its products to various countries and the Company owns a small Caribbean-based telecommunications provider; these are the only foreign operations with non-U.S. revenue or assets that the Company consolidates.  Unconsolidated non-U.S. based investments include the investments in Fortescue, Inmet and Linkem.
Certain information concerning the Companys segments is presented in the following table.  Consolidated subsidiaries are reflected as of the date a majority controlling interest was acquired, which was December 30, 2011 for National Beef.  Since National Beefs operating activities subsequent to the acquisition during 2011 were not significant they have not been included in the Companys 2011 consolidated statement of operations.  Associated Companies are not considered to be a reportable segment, but are reflected in the table below under income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets employed.

Exhibit 99.2
The Selected Financial Data of the Company included in this Exhibit 99.2 has been revised to reflect Keen Energy Services, LLC as a discontinued operation in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  All other information included in this exhibit remains unchanged and does not reflect any other events or developments that have occurred subsequent to February 27, 2012.  More current information is included in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in exhibits 99.3, 99.4 and 99.5, respectively.
The following selected financial data have been summarized from the Companys consolidated financial statements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, such consolidated financial statements and Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Report.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.3
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company included in this Exhibit 99.3 has been revised to reflect Keen Energy Services, LLC as a discontinued operation in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  All other information included in this exhibit remains unchanged and does not reflect any other events or developments that have occurred subsequent to February 27, 2012.  Without limiting the foregoing, this filing does not purport to update Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the 2011 Form 10-K for any information, uncertainties, transactions, risks, events or trends occurring, or known to management.  More current information is included in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in exhibits 99.4 and 99.5, respectively.
The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Companys consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, related footnote disclosures and Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information, which appear in Part I and elsewhere in this Report.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
The Companys investment portfolio, equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities, particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices.  Changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) and equity.  However, changes in the market prices of investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, declines in the fair values of equity securities that the Company deems to be other than temporary, and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity.  JHYH also owns public securities with changes in market values reflected in its earnings.  Since the Company accounts for JHYH on the equity method of accounting, it records its share of JHYHs earnings in the consolidated statement of operations which increases the Companys exposure to volatility in the public securities markets.
The Companys largest publicly traded available for sale equity securities with changes in market values reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) are Fortescue and Inmet.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the market value of the Companys investment in the common shares of Fortescue decreased from $873,931,000 (excluding shares sold in 2011) to $569,256,000.  The market value of the Companys investment in Inmet decreased from $862,481,000 to $708,193,000.  The market value of the Companys investment in Jefferies, for which the fair value option was elected, decreased during the year with unrealized losses reflected in operations as a component of income related to associated companies.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized an unrealized loss related to its investment in Jefferies of $684,397,000.
Liquidity
Leucadia National Corporation is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities.  The Company continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value.  Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible.  Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries, as well as dispositions of existing businesses and investments.

In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non-current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs.  Securities classified as current and non-current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time.  As of December 31, 2011, the sum of these amounts aggregated $2,545,500,000.  However, since $694,265,000 of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements, is subject to trading restrictions, represents investments in non-public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements that restrict the Companys ability to use the funds for other purposes, the Company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet its liquidity needs.  The $1,851,235,000 that is available is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities (including the Fortescue and Inmet common shares).  The Companys available liquidity, and the investment income realized from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Companys short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.
 
The holding companys only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($1,474,311,000 principal outstanding as of December 31, 2011).  In January 2012, the Company called for redemption $511,344,000 aggregate principal amount of bonds pursuant to pre-existing call rights; excluding accrued interest the Company will pay an aggregate of $528,308,000 to redeem the bonds in March 2012.  The contractual maturity of these bonds was $423,140,000 in 2017 and $88,204,000 in 2027.  Excluding these bonds, the holding companys remaining long-term debt matures as follows: $406,745,000 in 2013, $97,581,000 in 2014 and $458,641,000 in 2015.  Historically, the Company has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but, except as disclosed in this Report, the timing of any future investments and the cost cannot be predicted.
From time to time in the past, the Company has accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings.  The funds raised have been used by the Company for general corporate purposes, including for its existing businesses and new investment opportunities.  However, given the recent volatility in the credit markets, if and when the Company decides to raise funds through an underwritten bond offering it might be at a higher interest rate than in the past, or with terms that the Company may not find acceptable.  The Company has no current intention to seek additional bond financing, and will rely on its existing liquidity to fund corporate overhead expenses and corporate interest payments and, to fund new investing opportunities, it may also dispose of existing businesses and investments.  The Companys senior debt obligations are rated four levels below investment grade by Moodys Investors Services, two levels below investment grade by Fitch Ratings and one level below investment grade by Standard & Poors.  Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.
In March 2011, the Company invested an additional $50,000,000 in Sangart, which increased its ownership interest to approximately 96%.
In June 2011, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the assets of Seghesio Family Vineyards, the owner and operator of premium estate vineyards and a winery located in Healdsburg, California.  The cash purchase price was $86,018,000, which was primarily allocated as follows: $48,503,000 to property, equipment and leasehold improvements, $22,250,000 to amortizable intangible assets, $1,053,000 to goodwill and $12,962,000 to prepaids and other current assets (principally inventory).
During 2009, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway provided Berkadia with a five-year, $1 billion secured credit facility, which was used to fund outstanding mortgage loans and servicer advances, purchase mortgage servicing rights and for working capital needs.  In 2010, Berkadias secured credit facility was amended to increase the size of the credit facility to $1.5 billion, with the Company agreeing to provide the increased funds under the facility.  In 2011, Berkadia fully repaid the amount outstanding under its secured credit facility, including $250,000,000 that was loaned by the Company, with funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of Berkadia.  Effective as of December 31, 2011, the secured credit facility was terminated.  All of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by Berkadia to fund new mortgage loans, servicer advances, investments and other working capital requirements.  Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $2,500,000,000 surety policy issued by a Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsidiary and corporate guaranty, and the Company has agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for one-half of any losses incurred.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $2,000,000,000.

During 2011, the Company sold 117,400,000 common shares of Fortescue for net cash proceeds of $732,217,000, which resulted in the recognition of a net securities gain of $628,197,000.  In January 2012, the Company sold 100,000,000 Fortescue common shares for net cash proceeds of $506,490,000, and will record a net securities gain of $417,887,000 during the three month period ending March 31, 2012.
During 2011, the Company received $171,718,000 from FMG (net of $19,080,000 in withholding taxes) in payment of interest due on the FMG Note for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2011.  In January 2012, the Company received $97,093,000 (net of $10,788,000 in withholding taxes) from FMG in payment of interest due for the second half of 2011.  Future interest payments under the FMG Note will be dependent upon the physical volume of iron ore sold and the selling price, which can fluctuate widely, as well as the outcome of the litigation as described below.  As a result, it is not possible to predict whether interest earned in the most recent year will continue at the same level in future years.
In August 2010, the Company was advised that Fortescue is asserting that FMG is entitled to issue additional notes identical to the FMG Note in an unlimited amount.  Fortescue further claims that any interest to be paid on additional notes can dilute, on a pro rata basis, the Companys entitlement to the stated interest of 4% of net revenue.  The Company does not believe that FMG has the right to issue additional notes which affect the Companys interest or that the interpretation by Fortescue of the terms of the FMG Note, as currently claimed by Fortescue, reflects the agreement between the parties.
In September 2010, the Company filed a Writ of Summons against Fortescue, FMG and Fortescues then Chief Executive Officer in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  The Writ of Summons seeks, among other things, an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the FMG Note and damages.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and additional notes are issued, the Companys future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be significantly and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.
During 2011, the Company purchased an aggregate of 8,654,639 Jefferies common shares through a public offering, in private transactions and in the open market for total cash consideration of $167,753,000.
During 2011, the Company acquired 10,422,859 common shares of Mueller, representing approximately 27.3% of the outstanding common shares of Mueller, for aggregate cash consideration of $408,558,000.  The Company has entered into a standstill agreement with Mueller for the two year period ending September 1, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has agreed not to sell its shares if the buyer would own more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares.
On December 30, 2011, the Company acquired 78.9% of National Beef for aggregate net cash consideration of $867,869,000, and National Beef became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.  At December 31, 2011, National Beefs credit facility consisted of a $323,750,000 outstanding term loan and a revolving credit line of up to $250,000,000; amounts outstanding under the facility mature in June 2016.  The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of $9,250,000.  The term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the credit facility), plus a margin ranging from .75% to 2.50% depending upon certain financial ratios and the rate selected.  At December 31, 2011, the interest rate on the term loan was 2.1% and the interest rate in the revolving credit facility was 2.2%.  The credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of National Beef and its subsidiaries, which aggregated $1,786,855,000 at December 31, 2011.  The Company has not guaranteed any of National Beefs liabilities.  For more information on the allocation of the purchase price to National Beefs individual assets and liabilities, see Critical Accounting Estimates below.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Companys liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.
 
3
 
In March 2007, the Board of Directors increased the number of the Companys common shares that the Company is authorized to purchase.  Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.  During the three year period ended December 31, 2011, the only common shares acquired by the Company were in connection with the exercise of stock options.  As of February 16, 2012, the Company is authorized to repurchase 11,987,880 common shares.
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial NOLs and other tax attributes.  The amount and availability of the NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Companys certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares.  The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.  For more information about the NOLs and other tax attributes, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
As discussed above, the Company has historically relied on its available liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments.  Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Companys operating businesses do not generally require significant funds to support their operating activities, and the Company does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs.  The components of the Companys operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period.  Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from investments in associated companies may be outside the control of the Company.  As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.
Net cash of $9,084,000 and $431,266,000 was provided by operating activities in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in operating cash flows reflects interest payments received from FMG ($171,718,000 in 2011 and $154,930,000 in 2010, net of withholding taxes), greater income tax payments, lower interest payments and the proceeds received from the sale of ACF in excess of the cost of the investment in 2010 ($404,700,000).  Keen, a discontinued operation, generated funds of $23,446,000 and $7,311,000 during 2011 and 2010, respectively; Premier generated funds of $26,516,000 and $26,524,000 during 2011 and 2010, respectively; and the Companys manufacturing segments generated funds of $12,819,000 and $28,333,000 during 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Funds used by Sangart, a development stage company, increased to $39,396,000 during 2011 from $23,757,000 during 2010.  During 2011, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by Berkadia ($23,636,000), Jefferies ($7,789,000) and Garcadia ($5,654,000).  In 2010, distributions from associated companies principally include ACF, earnings distributed by Berkadia ($29,000,000) and Jefferies ($14,575,000).  Net gains related to real estate, property and equipment, and other assets in 2011 include a gain of $81,848,000 on forgiveness of debt related to the Myrtle Beach project.  Funds provided by operating activities include $4,690,000 and $11,640,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, from funds distributed by Empire Insurance Company (Empire), a discontinued operation.

Net cash of $431,266,000 was provided by operating activities in 2010 as compared to $133,398,000 of cash used for operating activities in 2009.  The change in operating cash flows reflects the sale of ACF in 2010, interest paid on the FMG Note in 2010, greater income tax payments, lower interest payments and increased distributions of earnings from associated companies.  The telecommunications operations of STi Prepaid, LLC (STi Prepaid), which was sold during 2010, generated funds from operating activities of $532,000 in 2010 and $3,355,000 in 2009.  The property management and services operations of ResortQuest International, LLC (ResortQuest), which was sold in 2010, generated funds from operating activities of $6,268,000 in 2010 and used funds of $888,000 in 2009.  Keen, which became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009, generated funds of $7,311,000 in 2010 and used funds of $5,410,000 in 2009.  Premier generated funds of $26,524,000 and $21,866,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively; and the Companys manufacturing segments generated funds from operating activities of $28,333,000 and $30,342,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Funds used by Sangart, a development stage company, were $23,757,000 in 2010 and $20,334,000 in 2009.  In 2010, distributions from associated companies principally include ACF, earnings distributed by Berkadia ($29,000,000) and Jefferies ($14,575,000).  In 2009, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by HFH ShortPLUS Fund L.P. (Shortplus) ($14,545,000), Keen ($8,379,000) and Garcadia ($11,108,000).  Funds provided by operating activities include $11,640,000 and $11,253,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively, from funds distributed by Empire.
Net cash of $175,297,000 and $208,718,000 was used for investing activities in 2011 and 2010, respectively, as compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $71,971,000 in 2009.  During 2011, proceeds from disposals of real estate, property and equipment, and other assets include $12,040,000 from the sale of certain of Keens rigs.  Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, primarily relates to the Companys acquisition of National Beef and Seghesio Family Vineyards.  Proceeds from disposal of discontinued operations, net of expenses and cash of operations sold principally include STi Prepaid ($10,644,000) in 2011 and ResortQuest ($52,135,000), a shopping center ($17,064,000) and STi Prepaid ($(9,819,000)) in 2010.  Investments in associated companies include Jefferies ($167,753,000), Mueller ($408,558,000), Linkem ($88,575,000) and Garcadia ($32,400,000) in 2011, Berkadia ($292,544,000), Las Cruces ($2,687,000), Jefferies ($17,998,000) and ACF ($7,236,000) in 2010 and Las Cruces ($43,320,000), ACF ($13,316,000) and Berkadia ($217,169,000) in 2009.  Capital distributions and loan repayment from associated companies include Berkadia ($283,530,000), JHYH ($8,710,000), Jefferies ($8,326,000) and Garcadia ($10,382,000) in 2011, ACF ($425,842,000), Berkadia ($44,544,000), JHYH ($17,077,000), Wintergreen Partners Fund, L.P. (Wintergreen) ($4,397,000) and Garcadia ($8,778,000) in 2010 and Keen ($28,340,000), Wintergreen ($38,958,000), Shortplus ($24,861,000) and Starboard Value Opportunity Partners, LP ($11,502,000) in 2009.
Net cash of $106,637,000 and $21,948,000 was used for financing activities in 2011 and 2009, respectively, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $64,664,000 in 2010.  Issuance of long-term debt primarily reflects the increase in repurchase agreements of $16,358,000, $202,539,000 and $47,494,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and, in 2011, $75,947,000 borrowed by National Beef under its revolving credit facility.  Immediately after the Companys acquisition of its interest, National Beef borrowed funds to redeem the interest of its chief executive officer pursuant to pre-existing put rights.
Reduction of debt for 2011 includes $19,275,000 in full satisfaction of the Myrtle Beach projects non-recourse indebtedness, $32,881,000 on the maturity of debt of a subsidiary that was collateralized by certain of the Companys corporate aircraft, $8,500,000 for the repayment of Keens line of credit and $82,531,000 in the aggregate for the buyback of $21,359,000 principal amount of the Companys 8 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015, $54,860,000 principal amount of the Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2017 and $1,350,000 principal amount of the Companys 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2027.  Reduction of debt for 2010 includes $10,226,000 for repayment of debt by a subsidiary, and $80,859,000 in the aggregate for the buyback of $5,500,000 principal amount of the 7 3/4% Senior Notes, $27,200,000 principal amount of the 7% Senior Notes, $20,000,000 principal amount of the 8 1/8% Senior Notes, $22,000,000 principal amount of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, and $2,146,000 principal amount of the 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures.  Reduction of debt for 2009 includes $35,361,000 in the aggregate for the buyback of $35,555,000 principal amount of the 7% Senior Notes and $6,500,000 principal amount of the 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures.  Purchase of interest in subsidiary by noncontrolling interest for 2011 represents the acquisition of a minority interest in National Beef by its chief executive officer immediately after the Company acquired its interest.  Issuance of common shares reflects the exercise of employee stock options for all periods.

Debt due within one year includes $417,479,000 and $401,121,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Companys subsidiaries.  These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.3%, mature in January 2012 and are secured by non-current investments with a carrying value of $432,768,000 at December 31, 2011.  These borrowings are used solely to fund a portion of the purchase price of a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government agencies (GNMA) and by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA).  The securities purchased are generally adjustable rate certificates, secured by seasoned pools of securitized, highly rated residential mortgages, and the certificates acquired generally represent all of the certificates issued by the securitization.
The Companys senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more Indebtedness or issue Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries unless, at the time of such incurrence or issuance, the Company meets a specified ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, limit the ability of the Company and Material Subsidiaries to incur, in certain circumstances, Liens, limit the ability of Material Subsidiaries to incur Funded Debt in certain circumstances, and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures.  The Company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions.  If the Company is unable to meet the specified ratio, the Company would not be able to issue additional Indebtedness or Preferred Stock, but the Companys inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures.  The senior note indentures do not restrict the payment of dividends.  Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company require that collateral be provided to the lender; principally as a result of such requirements, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were $2,251,548,000 at December 31, 2011.

As shown below, at December 31, 2011, the Companys contractual cash obligations totaled $3,171,458,000.
Contractual cash obligations aggregating $783,135,000 related to indebtedness called for redemption in 2012 are reflected in the table above in the period of their original contractual maturities.
The estimated interest expense on debt includes interest related to variable rate debt which the Company determined using rates in effect at December 31, 2011.  Amounts related to the Companys pension liability ($63,073,000) are included in the table in the less than 1 year period ($3,000,000) and the remainder in the 1-3 years period; however, the exact timing of those cash payments is uncertain.  The above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain.  Such amounts aggregated $9,800,000 at December 31, 2011; for more information, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
When the Company sold its former telecommunications subsidiary, WilTel Communications Group, LLC (WilTel) in 2005, WilTels defined benefit pension plan was not transferred in connection with the sale.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded a liability of $63,073,000 on its consolidated balance sheet for WilTels unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligation.  This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to former employees of WilTel (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts.  Since the benefits in this plan have been frozen, future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, changes in the market value of plan assets, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.
The Company expects to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust account for the WilTel defined benefit pension plan in the future to reduce its plan liabilities although the timing after 2012 is uncertain.  The Company expects to contribute $3,000,000 to WilTels defined benefit pension plan in 2012.  The tax deductibility of contributions is not a primary consideration, principally due to the availability of the Companys NOLs to otherwise reduce taxable income.
As of December 31, 2011, certain amounts for the WilTel plan are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management.  These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets.  The timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market.
This discount rate will be used to determine pension expense in 2012.  Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in this discount rate would affect pension expense by $492,000 and the benefit obligation by $9,182,000.
The deferred losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates.  Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $71,131,000 at December 31, 2011.  A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2012 based on an amortization period of twelve years.
 
 The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
   
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
 At December 31, 2011, the Companys off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit.  Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project.  These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project.  CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds.  Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn.  At December 31, 2011, the amount of outstanding bonds was $1,224,000, almost all of which expires in 2012 and 2013.
   
 
 Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $36,524,000 at December 31, 2011, principally to secure various obligations.  All of these letters of credit expire before 2016.
   
As discussed above, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway have agreed to share equally any losses incurred under a $2,500,000,000 surety policy and corporate guaranty issued by Berkshire Hathaway for a commercial paper program funding sponsored by Berkadia.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $2,000,000,000.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions.  The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome wont be known until a later date.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  If in the future the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period.  If in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period.  The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance.  Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.
Income Taxes 
During 2010, the Company realized significant gains from the sale of certain investments, recorded significant unrealized gains in the fair values of other investments and began to experience modest improvement in the operating results in some business segments.  Additionally, the Companys cumulative taxable income for recent years became a positive amount, reflecting the realized gains on the sales of ACF and Las Cruces during the fourth quarter of 2010.  With this recent positive evidence the Company gave greater weight to its revised projections of future taxable income, which consider significant unrealized gains in its investment portfolio, and to its long-term historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income when assessing the amount of its required valuation allowance.  As a result, the Company was able to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a significant portion of the Companys net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,157,111,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense on December 31, 2010.  In addition to its projections of future taxable income, the Company is relying upon the sale of investments that have unrealized gains before the NOLs expire and the corresponding reversal of related deferred tax liabilities to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset.
The Companys estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its operating businesses and investments, included an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the Company estimated it would have available NOLs (until 2029).  The Company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts, further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible.  In addition to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized gains, the Company will need to generate approximately $4,600,000,000 of future U.S. pre-tax income to fully realize its net deferred tax asset.  The current balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance principally reserves for NOLs of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the Companys consolidated tax return group.
The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Companys assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).  The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on managements estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value.  If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

One of the Companys real estate subsidiaries (MB1) had been the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The project was comprised of a retail center with approximately 346,000 square feet of retail space, 41,000 square feet of office space and 195 residential apartment rental units.  The acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the Company and nonrecourse indebtedness with a balance of $100,524,000 at December 31, 2010, that was collateralized by the real estate.
During the second quarter of 2009, MB1 was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan.  These events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the Company to evaluate whether the carrying amount of MB1s real estate asset was recoverable.  The Company prepared cash flow models and utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of MB1s real estate.  The most significant assumptions in the Companys cash flow models were the discount rate (11%) and the capitalization rate used to estimate the selling price of the retail center (9%); these rates were selected based on published reports of market conditions for similar properties.  Based on its evaluation, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $67,826,000 during the second quarter of 2009 (classified as selling, general and other expenses).  Although MB1s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficient funds and the Company was under no obligation to provide the funds to MB1 to pay off the loan.
During the second quarter of 2010, MB1 entered into an agreement with its lenders under which, among other things, MB1 agreed not to interfere with or oppose foreclosure proceedings and the lenders agreed to release MB1 and various guarantors of the loan.  A receiver was put in place at the property, foreclosure proceedings commenced and an auction of the property was conducted; however, the Company was informed during the fourth quarter of 2010 that the highest bidder for the property failed to close.  In December 2010, the Company was invited to make a bid for the property, with the condition that a foreclosure sale to the Company must close as soon as possible without any due diligence period, which new bidders for the property would require.  A subsidiary of the Company offered $19,275,000 for the property (including net working capital amounts); the offer was accepted and the foreclosure sale closed on January 7, 2011.
As a result of the failure of the initial buyer to purchase the property and the subsequent sale to the Company in 2011, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the property was further impaired at December 31, 2010; accordingly, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge in 2010 of $47,074,000 to reflect the property at its fair value of $18,094,000.  At closing in 2011, MB1 was released from any remaining liability under the bank loan; accordingly, the remaining balance due after payment of the purchase price ($81,848,000) was recognized in other income in 2011.  Including the cash paid in the foreclosure sale, the Companys cumulative net cash investment in this project is $85,595,000.
There were no significant impairment charges recorded during 2011.  During 2010, the Company recorded impairment charges in selling, general and other expenses of $2,357,000 for another real estate project and $1,449,000 in the corporate segment for one of its corporate aircraft that was later sold.  In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges in selling, general and other expenses of $2,563,000 related to its manufacturing segment (primarily Idaho Timber) and $3,646,000 related to its real estate segment.
Current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Companys operations and investments.  A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the Companys operations and investments.  If future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in intangible assets and property and equipment (for example, beef processing, manufacturing, gaming entertainment, real estate and certain associated company investments), impairment charges would have to be recorded.

The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary.  For investments in investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method, the Company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements, net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements.  On a quarterly basis, the Company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural, valuation, composition and other changes at the investee.  Since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value, after application of the equity method the carrying value of the Companys investment is equal to its share of the investees underlying net assets at their fair values.  Absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments, which would be separately evaluated, it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required.
Impairment of Equity Method Investments 
 
For equity method investments in operating businesses, the Company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee.  Whenever the Company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired, the Company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets.  The Company will use this information and, together with discussions with the investees management, evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary, record an impairment charge.
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the Companys equity in losses of Garcadia included impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,348,000.  Garcadias automobile dealerships had been adversely impacted by general economic conditions, and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest U.S. automobile manufacturers was a change in circumstances that caused Garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets.  Garcadia prepared discounted cash flow projections for each of its dealerships and concluded that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired.
 
Declines in the fair value of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in net securities gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment of Securities 
The Companys determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria.  The various factors that the Company considers in making its determination are specific to each investment.  For publicly traded debt and equity securities, the Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity, and other factors specific to the individual investment.  For investments in private equity funds and non-public securities, the Company bases its determination upon financial statements, net asset values and/or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies.
The Company recorded the following impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations during the three year period ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

The Companys assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from the Companys estimates and judgments.
The Companys operating subsidiaries do not provide financing to their customers in the ordinary course of business.  However, the Company does have the FMG Note, which had a balance of $40,801,000 at December 31, 2011, that meets the accounting definition of a finance receivable.  The Company exercises judgment in evaluating the credit risk and collectability of this note.  This assessment was made prior to the inception of the credit exposure and continues to be made at regular intervals.  The various factors that the Company considers in making its assessment include the current and projected financial condition of FMG, the Companys collection experience and the length of time until the note becomes due.  As a result of its assessment, the Company concluded that an allowance for credit losses was not required as of December 31, 2011.
Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses 
At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values.  Significant judgments and estimates are often made by the Companys management to determine these values, and may include the use of appraisals, consideration of market quotes for similar transactions, use of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information the Company believes to be relevant.  The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are significantly different from initially recorded amounts adjustments to prior periods may be required.  Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense.  If the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired are greater than the purchase price, the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income.  Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.  At December 31, 2011, the book value of goodwill was $18,119,000 and was not impaired.
Business Combinations 
 
Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.  Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Companys original judgments and estimates to be inaccurate.  In addition, long-lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment, intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss.  The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.
In December 2011, the Company acquired 78.9% of National Beef and it became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price included $446,166,000 to property, equipment and leasehold improvements, $809,569,000 to amortizable intangible assets, $8,915,000 to goodwill, $269,395,000 to net working capital accounts, $357,529,000 to long-term debt and $304,356,000 to redeemable non-controlling interests.
 
12
 
To assist the Companys management in its determination of the fair value of National Beefs property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and equity value, the Company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm.  The methods used by the Companys management to determine the fair values included estimating National Beefs business enterprise value through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis.  Property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current market prices.  The Company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment, including local market conditions, recent market transactions, the size, age, condition, utility and character of the property, the estimated cost to acquire replacement property, an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets.
Amounts allocated to product inventories were principally based on quoted commodity prices on the acquisition date.  For other components of working capital, the historical carrying values approximated fair values.  National Beefs long-term debt principally consists of its senior credit facility payable to its bank group, which was renegotiated in June 2011.  In December 2011, the lenders consented to the acquisition as required by the credit facility, and to certain other amendments to the facilitys covenants; the pricing of the credit facility remained the same.  In addition to these factors, the Company also analyzed changes in market interest rates from June 2011 and concluded that the principal amount due under the credit facility approximated its fair value on the acquisition date.
The fair value of certain pre-existing redeemable noncontrolling interests was the amount paid to redeem such interests immediately after the Companys acquisition of its controlling interest in National Beef.  The fair value of other redeemable noncontrolling interests was determined based upon the purchase price paid by the Company for its interest.
Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Further, a fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the next priority to inputs that dont qualify as Level 1 inputs but are nonetheless observable, either directly or indirectly, for the particular asset or liability (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Use of Fair Value Estimates 
 
Over 92% of the Companys investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities, which are carried at estimated fair value in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  The estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs), which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events, and as such are subject to market-related risks and uncertainties.  The Company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA), which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $622,191,000 at December 31, 2011.  Although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active, market prices are not always available for the identical security.  The fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers.  These estimates of fair value are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been significantly different from their estimated fair values.
The Company also has a segregated portfolio of non-agency mortgage-backed securities which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $39,839,000 at December 31, 2011.  Although these securities trade in brokered markets, the market for these securities is sometimes inactive.  The fair values of these investments are based on bid and ask prices, quotes obtained from independent market makers and pricing services.  These estimates of fair values are also considered to be Level 2 inputs.

The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to significant change with the passage of time as more information becomes available.  Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the Company to control.  The Company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a significant adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be significant in relation to results of operations for that period.  As of December 31, 2011, the Companys accrual for contingent losses was not significant.
Contingencies
Results of Operations
Substantially all of the Companys operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent internationally.  Poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the Companys operating subsidiaries and/or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services.  Troubled industry sectors, like the residential real estate market, have had an adverse direct impact not only on the Companys real estate segments, but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the Companys other operating segments, including manufacturing and gaming entertainment.  The discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment; however, should general economic conditions worsen and/or if the country experiences a prolonged recession, the Company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted.
A summary of results of continuing operations for the Company for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):

Manufacturing  Idaho Timber
A summary of results of operations for Idaho Timber for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
Idaho Timbers revenues for 2011 decreased as compared to 2010; shipment volume and average selling prices decreased 6% and 2%, respectively.  Idaho Timber believes that the abundance of existing homes available for sale in the market and high unemployment will continue to negatively impact housing starts and Idaho Timbers revenues.  Until housing starts substantially increase, annual dimension lumber shipping volume may remain flat or could further decline.
Idaho Timbers revenues for 2010 increased as compared to 2009; shipment volume and average selling prices increased approximately 3% and 17%, respectively.  Idaho Timber believes that the increase in revenues for 2010 primarily reflected customers replenishing dimension lumber inventory levels during the first half of the year that had been reduced during the recession, an increase in housing starts in the first half of 2010 prior to the expiration of the federal governments home buyers tax credits program, a more balanced supply of lumber in the marketplace relative to demand and an increase in demand for certain of Idaho Timbers products.
Raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 81% of cost of sales), reflect the lower shipment volume in 2011 as compared to 2010.  Raw material cost per thousand board feet was largely unchanged in 2011 as compared to 2010.  Raw material costs reflect the greater shipment volume and increased costs in 2010 as compared to 2009.  Raw material cost per thousand board feet increased approximately 15% in 2010 as compared to 2009, which was caused by reduced supply due to increased low-grade lumber exports and greater demand.  The difference between Idaho Timbers selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is not necessarily the same.  Idaho Timbers spread decreased approximately 14% in 2011 as compared to the prior year; the spread in 2010 increased by 29% as compared to the prior year.  Cost of sales during 2009 also included charges of $1,427,000 to reduce the carrying value of certain timber deed contracts.

Manufacturing  Conwed Plastics
A summary of results of operations for Conwed Plastics for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
Conwed Plastics revenues decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily reflecting declines in the housing, construction and filtration markets.  The ongoing slump in the domestic housing and construction industries has continued to unfavorably impact Conwed Plastics revenues, and the drop in filtration product revenues in 2011 reflects greater sales during 2010 related to the 2010 gulf oil spill.  In addition, revenues in some markets declined due to tighter inventory control by certain customers, loss of customers to competitors and general economic conditions.  The turf, erosion control and agricultural markets reflect increased revenues during 2011, principally due to increases in market share and new customers.
Conwed Plastics revenues increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily in the erosion control, filtration, consumer products and turf reinforcement markets.  While Conwed Plastics saw signs of improved economic conditions in those markets and benefited from certain new product launches and new uses of its products, its results continued to be negatively impacted by competitive pressures and customers closely managing their inventory.
The primary raw material in Conwed Plastics products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price has historically fluctuated with the price of oil.  Global demand for raw materials has also resulted in higher prices for polypropylene.  Prices for polypropylene resin increased substantially in each annual period as compared to the preceding year, which adversely affected gross margin.  The volatility of oil and natural gas prices along with current general economic conditions worldwide make it difficult to predict future raw material costs.  Conwed Plastics believes that the increased competition for raw materials by foreign nations have and will continue to adversely impact raw material costs.  In addition, gross margins declined in 2011 due to changes in product mix and in 2010 due to greater amortization expense for intangible assets.
 
 Selling, general and other expenses in 2011 include losses of $1,404,000 related to the loss of a major customer and the sale of the plant in Mexico, and $634,000 of severance costs and professional fees related to employment matters.

Gaming Entertainment
A summary of results of operations for Premier for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
Premiers gaming revenues increased 3% in 2011 as compared to 2010, principally due to slot machine revenue, which increased due to customer loyalty programs and enhancements, offset in part by a larger amount of table games payouts.  During 2011, overall gaming revenues for the entire Biloxi market declined slightly as compared to 2010.  Premiers gaming revenues for 2010 increased approximately 12% as compared to 2009, while the local gaming market was largely unchanged.  Premier implemented new and enhanced customer loyalty programs, which it believes was the primary reason for the growth in its gaming revenues and market share.
The increase in direct operating expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily reflects greater marketing and promotional costs.  The increase in direct operating expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily reflects greater gaming taxes and marketing and promotional costs.
Selling, general and other expenses for 2010 include a loss for the award of $11,200,000, including interest, to the former holders of Premiers bond debt as a result of a decision by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.  The Premier noteholders had argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the notes, and as such were entitled to more than the amount paid to them when Premier emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.  Premier filed a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Courts decision and no amounts were paid while the appeal was pending.  In April 2011, Premier entered into an agreement to settle the litigation with its former noteholders for $9,000,000.  As a result, Premier reduced the liability for the award and credited selling, general and other expenses for $2,241,000 in 2011.  All litigation with respect to Premiers chapter 11 restructuring has been settled.
Domestic Real Estate
A summary of results of operations for the domestic real estate segment for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
 
17
 
Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segments operating properties, the current status of the Companys real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold.  As a result, pre-tax results for this segment for any particular period are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.
Revenues and other income in 2011 period include a gain on forgiveness of debt of $81,848,000 related to the Myrtle Beach project.  As is more fully discussed above, in January 2011 a subsidiary of the Company paid $19,275,000 to the lenders of the Myrtle Beach project in full satisfaction of the projects non-recourse indebtedness, which had a balance of $100,524,000 at December 31, 2010.  The Company had previously recorded impairment charges which reduced the carrying amount of this project of $47,074,000 in 2010 and $67,826,000 in 2009.
The Company did not have any major real estate sales during 2011 and 2010; revenues and other income for 2009 include real estate sales of $12,422,000.  Revenues and other income in 2010 include a gain of $1,200,000 for the favorable settlement of an insurance claim and a lawsuit, and in 2009 include $962,000 of income related to the accounting for the mark-to-market value of an interest rate derivative relating to the Myrtle Beach projects debt obligation.
Other operating expenses also include impairment charges for real estate projects of $2,357,000 and $3,646,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  In 2009 other operating expenses also include a charge of $1,444,000 representing the net book value of land and buildings that was contributed to a local municipality and $1,787,000 for the periodic net settlement amount for the interest rate derivative.
Residential property sales volume, prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many U.S. markets, including markets in which the Company has real estate projects.  The slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit markets during the past few years, which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers.  The Company has deferred its development plans for certain of its real estate development projects, and is not actively soliciting bids for its fully developed projects.  The Company intends to wait for market conditions to improve before marketing certain of its projects for sale.
Medical Product Development
A summary of results of operations for Sangart for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
Revenues and other income for 2009 include $5,000,000 of insurance proceeds received upon the death of Sangarts former chief executive officer.  Sangarts selling, general and other expenses include research and development costs of $22,130,000, $5,428,000 and $3,487,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The increase in research and development costs in 2011 primarily related to preparation for and commencement of a larger Phase 2 clinical study of MP4OX in trauma patients, as well as $10,000,000 related to a new patent license.
 
18
 
Sangarts results reflect charges (reductions) to selling, general and other expenses of $(4,447,000), $261,000 and $3,102,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to share-based awards previously granted to a former officer.  The fair value of these share-based awards increased during 2009 and 2010 but declined during 2011; accordingly, in 2011 Sangart reduced the liability and credited selling, general and other expenses.  Salaries and incentive compensation expense increased in 2011 principally due to higher headcount.
Selling, general and other expenses in 2010 reflect $859,000 of lower professional fees, $734,000 of decreased costs for severance and $700,000 of greater royalty expense than for 2009.  Selling, general and other expenses for 2009 included $1,892,000 of charges for manufacturing facility design costs that Sangart did not expect to use.
Sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales.  During 2010, Sangart completed a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial of MP4OX in trauma patients in Europe and South Africa.  Study results were considered to be successful and supported the conduct of a larger Phase 2 clinical study in trauma patients, which commenced in the second quarter of 2011.  If this larger Phase 2 study were to be successful, Sangart would have to conduct Phase 3 clinical studies in trauma patients.  Completing these studies will take several years at substantial cost, and until they are successfully completed, if ever, Sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from sales in the trauma market.  Sangart also recently commenced a Phase 1b clinical study involving its MP4CO product to treat sickle cell disease patients.  If this Phase 1b study were to be successful, Sangart would have to conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies in sickle cell disease patients, at substantial cost, prior to requesting marketing approval for the product.  The Company is unable to predict when, if ever, it will report operating profits for this segment.
Other Operations
A summary of results of operations for other operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
 
19
 
Other income for 2011 and 2010 includes $5,366,000 and $11,143,000, respectively, with respect to government grants to reimburse the Company for certain of its prior expenditures related to energy projects, which were fully expensed as incurred.  The change in revenues and other income for 2011 and 2010 also reflects $14,592,000 and $2,834,000, respectively, of increased revenues at the winery operations.   The change in revenues and other income for 2011 also reflect $4,540,000 of less income from a property rental business and $2,303,000 less income from purchased delinquent credit card receivables.
Selling, general and other expenses include $33,606,000, $26,776,000 and $23,546,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the investigation and evaluation of energy projects (principally professional fees and other costs).  Selling, general and other expenses for 2010 also reflect $4,326,000 for other operations portion of a settlement charge in connection with the termination and settlement of the Companys frozen defined benefit pension plan, and a $3,000,000 charge for a settlement with certain insurance companies.  The change in selling, general and other expenses for 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior year also reflects $12,152,000 and $2,102,000, respectively, of greater costs at the winery operations, and for 2011 $1,412,000 of lower costs at the property rental business.  Selling, general and other expenses also include charges of $1,513,000 and $4,712,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively, at the winery operations to reduce the carrying amount of wine inventory.
Corporate
A summary of results of operations for corporate for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows (in thousands):
 
20
 
Net securities gains (losses) for Corporate aggregated $641,480,000, $179,494,000 and $(21,106,000) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Net securities gains (losses) include gains of $628,197,000 and $94,918,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively, resulting from the sale of a portion of the Companys investment in the common shares of Fortescue, and in 2010 include a gain of $66,200,000 from the sale of the Companys investment in LPH.  Net securities gains (losses) are net of impairment charges of $3,586,000, $2,474,000 and $31,420,000 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Companys decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual securitys value at the time, the prospect for changes in its value in the future and/or the Companys liquidity needs.  The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Companys tax attributes.  The timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.
Investment income increased $23,008,000 in 2011 as compared to 2010, principally due to cash dividends of $13,726,000 paid on Fortescues common shares and greater investment income due to a larger amount of fixed income securities.  Investment income declined $5,075,000 in 2010 as compared to 2009 principally due to lower interest rates.
Other income, which decreased $322,851,000 in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased $449,997,000 in 2010 as compared to 2009, includes $214,455,000, $149,257,000 and $66,079,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to Fortescues Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia.  The Company is entitled to receive 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from certain areas of Fortescues project, which commenced production in May 2008.  Depreciation and amortization expenses include prepaid mining interest amortization of $11,800,000, $9,943,000 and $7,293,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is being amortized over time in proportion to the amount of ore produced.  Other income in 2010 includes a gain on the sale of Las Cruces of $383,369,000, as discussed above.  Other income for 2010 and 2009 also includes gains for legal settlements of $2,107,000 and $10,453,000, respectively, and for 2009 gains of $6,693,000 on the repurchase of certain of the Companys debt securities.
The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects decreased interest expense as a result of conversions of certain of the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes during 2009 and, as discussed above, repurchases of certain of the Companys debt securities during each of the last three years.
The change in salaries and incentive compensation for 2011 as compared to 2010 is principally due to lower accrued incentive bonus expense of $37,558,000, of which $23,459,000 related to the Companys Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, partially offset by greater share-based compensation expense.  The change in salaries and incentive compensation for 2010 as compared to 2009 reflects greater accrued incentive bonus expense of $22,253,000, of which $5,600,000 related to the Companys Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, and lower share-based compensation expense.  Bonus accruals under the Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan are based on a percentage of pre-tax profits as defined in the plan.  Other Corporate incentive bonuses are discretionary and not determined based on any mathematical formula.  The Company recorded share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Companys senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan of $23,019,000, $4,067,000 and $10,905,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Share-based compensation expense increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 principally due to the warrants granted under the Companys senior executive warrant plan in the second quarter of 2011.  Share-based compensation expense declined for 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the warrants previously granted under the Companys senior executive warrant plan becoming fully vested.
 
21
 
Selling, general and other expenses include expenses related to the repurchase of certain of the Companys debt securities of $6,352,000 and $5,138,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Selling, general and other expenses include costs for the investigation of investment opportunities and fees due for consummated transactions of $18,820,000 and $3,377,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, including $14,834,000 related to the acquisition of National Beef in 2011.  Selling, general and other expenses for 2010 include $8,403,000 for Corporates portion of the defined benefit pension plan settlement charge and an impairment charge of $1,449,000 for a corporate aircraft.  Selling, general and other expenses for 2011 as compared to 2010 also reflects greater severance expense of $1,342,000, increased insurance expense of $1,326,000 and higher corporate aircraft expense of $1,029,000.  The change in selling, general and other expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 also reflects $28,300,000 of expenses incurred during 2009 related to the induced conversion of certain of the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes and higher corporate aircraft expense of $1,770,000 during 2010.
As discussed above, the income tax provision for 2010 reflects a credit of $1,157,111,000 as a result of the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset.  The Company adjusted the valuation allowance since it believes it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a substantial portion of the net deferred tax asset.  The tax provision for 2011 and 2010 also includes state and foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes on the FMG Note interest, of $21,445,000 and $14,926,000, respectively.
As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its net federal deferred tax asset, including its available NOLs.  As a result, the Company did not record any regular federal income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009.  However, the Company had significant unrealized security gains reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and in income related to associated companies.  If these gains were realized, the Company would be able to use its NOLs to fully offset the federal income taxes that would be due, but the Company would have to pay federal minimum taxes.  Although the payment of federal minimum taxes generates a minimum tax credit carryover, it would be fully reserved for in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded provisions for deferred federal minimum taxes payable of $22,678,000 and $11,594,000 in accumulated other comprehensive income and income related to associated companies, respectively.  In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes state and foreign income taxes, including withholding taxes on the FMG Note interest of $10,655,000.
The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 provided taxpayers a special election for extended net operating loss carryback benefits, and with respect to any net operating loss for which the election was made, eliminated the limitation that applies to using the NOL to reduce alternative minimum taxable income.  In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service provided additional guidance with respect to application of the law, and the Company made the election with respect to its 2008 NOL.  As a result, approximately $1,940,000,000 of the NOLs referred to above can be used to fully offset federal minimum taxable income, and no federal regular or minimum income tax would be payable on such income.  During 2010, the Company reversed deferred federal minimum tax liabilities which had been recorded in prior periods of $11,594,000 to income related to associated companies and $22,678,000 to accumulated other comprehensive income.
The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $600,000 and $2,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a result of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies.
Associated Companies
 
 Income (losses) related to associated companies includes the following for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
   
 
22
 
The Company elected the fair value option to account for its investments in Jefferies, Mueller and ACF, with changes in market values reflected directly in earnings.  The Company sold its investment in ACF in 2010.
Berkadia acquired its commercial mortgage origination and servicing business pursuant to an Asset Put Agreement (APA) entered into between Berkadia and the seller in September 2009.  The seller paid Berkadia $40,000,000 for the right to require Berkadia to purchase the business pursuant to the terms of the APA.  The seller subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and exercised the put option.  Although there were other parties interested in purchasing portions of the commercial mortgage origination and servicing business, Berkadias offer was the only offer for the entire business, which eliminated the sellers risk of having to dispose of the remaining business.  In addition, Berkadias offer included a provision to hire the employees operating the business, thereby saving the seller material employment related expenses.
Berkadia applied the acquisition method to account for the purchase and recorded the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value, which were principally mortgage servicing rights, mortgage loans and servicer advances.  The fair values of the net assets acquired exceeded the amount paid, principally due to the amount received as a put premium and the reasons identified above.  The excess was treated as a bargain purchase and recognized as a gain on the date of acquisition.  The Companys share of the bargain purchase gain was $24,423,000, which is reflected in the table for 2009.
The Companys equity in losses of Garcadia for 2009 includes impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,348,000.
The Company owns approximately 31.4% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002.  The Companys share of HomeFeds reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFeds development projects.
The Companys equity in losses of Keen includes impairment charges of $36,544,000 in 2009.  Keen became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009.
The Companys equity investment in Las Cruces was sold in 2010.

Other Operations
In 2010 the Company classified its power production business that burns waste biomass to produce electricity as a held for sale discontinued operation and recorded a charge of $25,321,000 to reduce the carrying amount of the business to its fair value.

For income tax purposes, the payments are treated as non-taxable distributions paid by a subsidiary.
The Company sold WilTel in December 2005.  During 2009, the Company received 636,300 of its common shares in connection with the resolution of a lawsuit related to WilTel and recorded income from discontinued operations of $15,222,000 based on the market value of the common shares.  These shares were originally issued in connection with the acquisition of WilTel in 2003, and had been held in a fund for certain claims made against WilTel prior to the Companys ownership.  The resolution of the lawsuit found that the claimants were not entitled to the shares and they were returned to the Company.

Exhibit 99.4
The Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the Company included in this Exhibit 99.4 has been revised to reflect Keen Energy Services, LLC as a discontinued operation in the Companys consolidated financial statements.  All other information included in this exhibit remains unchanged and does not reflect any other events or developments that have occurred subsequent to February 27, 2012.  More current information is included in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in exhibits 99.3 and 99.5, respectively.
Item 7A.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
The following includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
The Companys market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities and equity price risk.
The Companys investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in equity.  Included in the Companys available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 35% of the Companys total investment portfolio at December 31, 2011.  These fixed income securities are primarily rated investment grade or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises.  The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 4.3 years at December 31, 2011.  The Companys fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.  At December 31, 2010, fixed income securities comprised approximately 31% of the Companys total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 3.1 years.
Also included in the Companys available for sale investment portfolio are equity securities, which are recorded on the balance sheet at an aggregate fair value of $1,364,659,000 (aggregate cost of $666,801,000) and which comprised approximately 57% of the Companys total investment portfolio at December 31, 2011.  The majority of this amount consists of two publicly traded securities; the investment in Fortescue common shares, which is carried at fair value of $569,256,000, and the investment in Inmet, which is carried at fair value of $708,193,000.  The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.
The Company is also subject to price risk related to its investments in Jefferies and Mueller for which it has elected the fair value option.  At December 31, 2011, these investments are classified as investments in associated companies and carried at fair values of $797,583,000 for Jefferies and $400,446,000 for Mueller.
The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt.  Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.
The following table provides information about the Companys financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates.  For the variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.  For securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Companys historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities.

Tothe Board of Directors and
 
Shareholders of Leucadia National Corporation:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leucadia National Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded National Beef Packing Company, LLC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because it was acquired by the Company during 2011.  We have also excluded National Beef Packing Company, LLC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  National Beef Packing Company, LLC is a consolidated subsidiary whose total assets represent 19% of the related consolidated assets as of December 31, 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company is a diversified holding company engaged through its consolidated subsidiaries in a variety of businesses, including beef processing, manufacturing, gaming entertainment, real estate activities, medical product development and winery operations.  The Company also has significant investments in the common stock of Jefferies Group, Inc. (Jefferies), a full service investment bank and Mueller Industries, Inc. (Mueller), a leading manufacturer of copper, brass, plastic, and aluminum products, both of which are accounted for at fair value.  The Company owns equity interests in operating businesses which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including a broker-dealer engaged in making markets and trading of high yield and special situation securities, and a commercial mortgage origination and servicing business.  The Company continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and frequently investigates the acquisition of new businesses.  Changes in the mix of the Companys businesses and investments should be expected.
The beef processing operations are conducted by National Beef Packing Company, LLC (National Beef), the Companys 78.9% owned subsidiary, which was acquired on December 30, 2011.  Since National Beefs operating activities subsequent to the acquisition during 2011 were not significant they have not been included in the Companys 2011 consolidated statement of operations.  National Beef processes, packages and delivers fresh and frozen beef and beef by-products for sale to customers in the U.S. and international markets.  National Beefs products include boxed beef, ground beef, hides, tallow, and other beef and beef by-products. The products are marketed to retailers, food service providers, distributors, further processors, and the U.S. military. National Beef is based in Kansas City, Missouri and operates three beef processing facilities, two case-ready facilities and a wet blue tanning facility, all located in the U.S.
The manufacturing operations are conducted through Idaho Timber, LLC (Idaho Timber) and Conwed Plastics, LLC (Conwed Plastics).  Idaho Timbers principal product lines include remanufacturing dimension lumber; remanufacturing, bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers; and production of 5/4 radius-edge, pine decking.  Idaho Timber also manufactures and/or distributes a number of other specialty wood products.  Idaho Timber operates nine facilities located in the U.S.
Conwed Plastics manufactures and markets lightweight plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including, among other things, building and construction, erosion control, packaging, agricultural, carpet padding, filtration and consumer products.  Conwed Plastics manufacturing segment has four domestic manufacturing facilities, and it owns and operates a manufacturing and sales facility in Belgium.
The gaming entertainment business is conducted through Premier Entertainment Biloxi LLC (Premier).  Premier owns the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi (Hard Rock Biloxi) located in Biloxi, Mississippi.
The domestic real estate operations include a mixture of commercial properties, residential land development projects and other unimproved land.
The Companys medical product development operations are conducted through its majority-owned subsidiary, Sangart, Inc. (Sangart).  Sangart is developing a product called MP4OX, which is a solution of cell-free hemoglobin administered intravenously to provide rapid oxygen delivery to oxygen deprived tissues.
The winery operations consist of four wineries, Pine Ridge Vineyards in Napa Valley, California, Archery Summit in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, Chamisal Vineyards in the Edna Valley of Californiaand Seghesio Family Vineyards in Healdsburg, California, and a vineyard development project in the Columbia Valley of Washington.  The wineries primarily produce and sell wines in the premium, ultra premium and luxury segments of the premium table wine market.

Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with the 2011 presentation.
(a)      :  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions.  The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome wont be known until a later date.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  If in the future the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period.  If in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period.  The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance.  Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.
Income Taxes -
During 2010, the Company realized significant gains from the sale of certain investments, recorded significant unrealized gains in the fair values of other investments and began to experience modest improvement in the operating results in some business segments.  Additionally, the Companys cumulative taxable income for recent years became a positive amount, reflecting the realized gains on the sales of AmeriCredit Corp. (ACF) and Cobre Las Cruces, S.A. (Las Cruces) during the fourth quarter of 2010.  With this recent positive evidence the Company gave greater weight to its revised projections of future taxable income, which consider significant unrealized gains in its investment portfolio, and to its long-term historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income when assessing the amount of its required valuation allowance.  As a result, the Company was able to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a significant portion of the Companys net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,157,111,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense on December 31, 2010.  In addition to its projections of future taxable income, the Company is relying upon the sale of investments that have unrealized gains before the NOLs expire and the corresponding reversal of related deferred tax liabilities to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset.
The Companys estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its operating businesses and investments, included an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the Company estimated it would have available net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) (until 2029).  The Company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts, further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible.  In addition to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized gains, the Company will need to generate approximately $4,600,000,000 of future U.S. pre-tax income to fully realize its net deferred tax asset.  The current balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance principally reserves for NOLs of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the Companys consolidated tax return group.
The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Companys assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.
 
F-11
 
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).  The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on managements estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value.  If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
One of the Companys real estate subsidiaries (MB1) had been the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The project was comprised of a retail center with approximately 346,000 square feet of retail space, 41,000 square feet of office space and 195 residential apartment rental units.  The acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the Company and nonrecourse indebtedness with a balance of $100,524,000 at December 31, 2010, that was collateralized by the real estate.
During the second quarter of 2009, MB1 was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan.  These events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the Company to evaluate whether the carrying amount of MB1s real estate asset was recoverable.  The Company prepared cash flow models and utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of MB1s real estate.  The most significant assumptions in the Companys cash flow models were the discount rate (11%) and the capitalization rate used to estimate the selling price of the retail center (9%); these rates were selected based on published reports of market conditions for similar properties.  Based on its evaluation, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $67,826,000 during the second quarter of 2009 (classified as selling, general and other expenses).  Although MB1s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficient funds and the Company was under no obligation to provide the funds to MB1 to pay off the loan.
During the second quarter of 2010, MB1 entered into an agreement with its lenders under which, among other things, MB1 agreed not to interfere with or oppose foreclosure proceedings and the lenders agreed to release MB1 and various guarantors of the loan.  A receiver was put in place at the property, foreclosure proceedings commenced and an auction of the property was conducted; however, the Company was informed during the fourth quarter of 2010 that the highest bidder for the property failed to close.  In December 2010, the Company was invited to make a bid for the property, with the condition that a foreclosure sale to the Company must close as soon as possible without any due diligence period, which new bidders for the property would require.  A subsidiary of the Company offered $19,275,000 for the property (including net working capital amounts); the offer was accepted and the foreclosure sale closed on January 7, 2011.
As a result of the failure of the initial buyer to purchase the property and the subsequent sale to the Company in 2011, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the property was further impaired at December 31, 2010; accordingly, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge in 2010 of $47,074,000 to reflect the property at its fair value of $18,094,000.  At closing in 2011, MB1 was released from any remaining liability under the bank loan; accordingly, the remaining balance due after payment of the purchase price ($81,848,000) was recognized in other income in 2011.  Including the cash paid in the foreclosure sale, the Companys cumulative net cash investment in this project is $85,595,000.
There were no significant impairment charges recorded during 2011.  During 2010, the Company recorded impairment charges in selling, general and other expenses of $2,357,000 for another real estate project and $1,449,000 in the corporate segment for one of its corporate aircraft that was later sold.  In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges in selling, general and other expenses of $2,563,000 related to its manufacturing segment (primarily Idaho Timber) and $3,646,000 related to its real estate segment.
 
F-12
 
Current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Companys operations and investments.  A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the Companys operations and investments.  If future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in intangible assets and property and equipment (for example, beef processing, manufacturing, gaming entertainment, real estate and certain associated company investments), impairment charges would have to be recorded.
The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary.  For investments in investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method, the Company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements, net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements.  On a quarterly basis, the Company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural, valuation, composition and other changes at the investee.  Since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value, after application of the equity method the carrying value of the Companys investment is equal to its share of the investees underlying net assets at their fair values.  Absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments, which would be separately evaluated, it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required.
Impairment of Equity Method Investments 
For equity method investments in operating businesses, the Company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee.  Whenever the Company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired, the Company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets.  The Company will use this information and, together with discussions with the investees management, evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary, record an impairment charge.
The Company has a joint venture agreement with Garff Enterprises, Inc., pursuant to which the joint venture has acquired various automobile dealerships (Garcadia).  During the second quarter of 2009, the Companys equity in losses of Garcadia included impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,348,000.  Garcadias automobile dealerships had been adversely impacted by general economic conditions, and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest U.S. automobile manufacturers was a change in circumstances that caused Garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets.  Garcadia prepared discounted cash flow projections for each of its dealerships and concluded that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired.
Declines in the fair value of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in net securities gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment of Securities -
The Companys determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria.  The various factors that the Company considers in making its determination are specific to each investment. For publicly traded debt and equity securities, the Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity, and other factors specific to the individual investment.  For investments in private equity funds and non-public securities, the Company bases its determination upon financial statements, net asset values and/or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies.
 
F-13
 
The Company recorded the following impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations during the three year period ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
The Companys assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from the Companys estimates and judgments.
The Companys operating subsidiaries do not provide financing to their customers in the ordinary course of business.  However, the Company does have a 13 year unsecured zero-coupon note of FMG Chichester Pty Ltd (FMG), which had a balance of $40,801,000 at December 31, 2011 (see Note 6), that meets the accounting definition of a finance receivable.  The Company exercises judgment in evaluating the credit risk and collectability of this note.  This assessment was made prior to the inception of the credit exposure and continues to be made at regular intervals.  The various factors that the Company considers in making its assessment include the current and projected financial condition of FMG, the Companys collection experience and the length of time until the note becomes due.  As a result of its assessment, the Company concluded that an allowance for credit losses was not required as of December 31, 2011.
Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values.  Significant judgments and estimates are often made by the Companys management to determine these values, and may include the use of appraisals, consideration of market quotes for similar transactions, use of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information the Company believes to be relevant.  The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are significantly different from initially recorded amounts adjustments to prior periods may be required.  Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense.  If the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired are greater than the purchase price, the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income.  Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.  At December 31, 2011, the book value of goodwill was $18,119,000 and was not impaired.
Business Combinations -
Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.  Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Companys original judgments and estimates to be inaccurate.  In addition, long-lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment, intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss.  The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.
Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Further, a fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the next priority to inputs that dont qualify as Level 1 inputs but are nonetheless observable, either directly or indirectly, for the particular asset or liability (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Use of Fair Value Estimates -
 
F-14
 
Over 92% of the Companys investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities, which are carried at estimated fair value in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  The estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs), which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events, and as such are subject to market-related risks and uncertainties.  The Company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA), which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $622,191,000 at December 31, 2011.  Although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active, market prices are not always available for the identical security.  The fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers.  These estimates of fair value are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been significantly different from their estimated fair values.
The Company also has a segregated portfolio of non-agency mortgage-backed securities which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $39,839,000 at December 31, 2011.  Although these securities trade in brokered markets, the market for these securities is sometimes inactive.  The fair values of these investments are based on bid and ask prices, quotes obtained from independent market makers and pricing services.  These estimates of fair values are also considered to be Level 2 inputs.
- The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to significant change with the passage of time as more information becomes available.  Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the Company to control.  The Company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a significant adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be significant in relation to results of operations for that period.  As of December 31, 2011, the Companys accrual for contingent losses was not significant.
Contingencies
(b)      :  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all variable interest entities of which the Company or a subsidiary is the primary beneficiary, and all majority-controlled entities that are not variable interest entities.  The Company considers special allocations of cash flows and preferences, if any, to determine amounts allocable to noncontrolling interests.  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Consolidation Policy
Associated companies include equity interests in other entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  These include investments in corporations that the Company does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence and investments in limited partnerships in which the Companys interest is more than minor.
(c)      :  The Company considers short-term investments, which have maturities of less than three months at the time of acquisition, to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments of $2,691,000 and $310,901,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
(d)      :  At acquisition, marketable debt and equity securities are designated as either i) held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost, ii) trading, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in results of operations, or iii) available for sale, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of equity, net of taxes.  Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost.  The cost of securities sold is based on average cost.  Held to maturity investments are made with the intention of holding such securities to maturity, which the Company has the ability to do.
Investments
 
F-15
 
(e)      :  Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, if less, the term of the underlying lease.
Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
(f)      : Revenues are recognized when the following conditions are met: (1) collectibility is reasonably assured; (2) title to the product has passed or the service has been rendered and earned; (3) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; and (4) there is a fixed or determinable price.  National Beefs revenues are recognized based on the terms of the sale, which for beef processing operations is typically upon delivery to customers. Manufacturing revenues are recognized when title passes, which for Idaho Timber is generally upon the customers receipt of the goods and for Conwed Plastics upon shipment of goods.  Gaming entertainment revenues consist of casino gaming, hotel, food and beverage, and entertainment revenues.  Casino gaming revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses, reduced for the cash value of rewards earned by customers based on their level of play on slot machines.  Hotel, food and beverage, and entertainment revenues are recognized as services are performed.  Revenue from the sale of real estate is generally recognized when title passes; however, if the Company is obligated to make improvements to the real estate subsequent to closing, a portion of revenues are deferred and recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting.
Revenue Recognition
(g)      : National Beefs inventories consist primarily of meat products and supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost principally determined under the first-in-first-out method for meat products and average cost for supplies.
Inventories and Cost of Sales
Manufacturing inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost principally determined under the first-in-first-out method.  Manufacturing cost of sales principally includes product and manufacturing costs, inbound and outbound shipping costs and handling costs.
Direct operating expenses for gaming entertainment include expenses relating to casino gaming, hotel, food and beverage, and entertainment, which primarily consists of employees compensation and benefits, cost of sales related to food and beverage sales, marketing and advertising, gaming taxes, insurance, supplies, license fees and royalties.

Income Taxes
(j)       :  The Company reflects its derivative financial instruments in its balance sheet at fair value.  National Beef uses futures and forward contracts in order to reduce its exposure to changing commodity prices. In addition, the Company has from time to time utilized derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on certain debt obligations, hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign currency risk on certain available for sale securities; however, none are currently outstanding.  Although the Company believes that its derivative financial instruments help mitigate certain market risks, they do not meet the effectiveness criteria under GAAP, and therefore are not accounted for as hedges.
Derivative Financial Instruments
(k)      :  Foreign currency denominated investments and financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, except that revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period; resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of shareholders equity.  Net foreign exchange transaction losses were $202,000 for 2011, $511,000 for 2010 and $335,000 for 2009.

(l)      :   The cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and warrants, is recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.  The cost is recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the award.  The fair value of each award is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Share-Based Compensation
(m)      :  National Beef regularly enters into various transactions with an affiliate of NBPCo Holdings, LLC (NBPCo Holdings), and has entered into a cattle supply agreement with U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (USPB); entities that sold a substantial portion of their ownership in National Beef to the Company and are the owners of redeemable noncontrolling interests in National Beef.  National Beef sells product to and purchases material from a company affiliated with NBPCo Holdings in the ordinary course of business; transactions are based upon prevailing market prices on terms that could be obtained from an unaffiliated party.  National Beef and USPB are parties to a cattle supply agreement pursuant to which National Beef has agreed to purchase through USPB from the members of USPB 735,385 head of cattle per year (subject to adjustment), based on pricing grids furnished by National Beef to the members of USPB.  National Beef believes the pricing grids are based on terms that could be obtained from an unaffiliated party.  The cattle supply agreement is for an initial five year term, with automatic one year extensions on each annual anniversary date of the Companys acquisition of National Beef, unless either party provides a notice not to extend sixty days prior to the annual anniversary date.
Related Party Transactions
(n)      :  In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to improve the accounting for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity.  The amendments remove from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion.  The guidance, which is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011, is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements issued in accordance with GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  The amendment includes requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, but does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting.  The guidance, which is effective during interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.  This new accounting guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity; instead, it requires the presentation of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  This new accounting guidance was implemented in these consolidated financial statements and applied retrospectively.  Its adoption changed the presentation of the Companys consolidated financial statements but did not have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment. This amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The guidance, which is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions
National Beef
In December 2011, the Company acquired a controlling interest in National Beef for aggregate net cash consideration of $867,869,000.  Pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement among the Company, National Beef, USPB, NBPCo Holdings, TKK Investments, LLC (TKK), TMKCo, LLC (TMKCo) and TMK Holdings (TMK), the following transactions occurred in sequence on the closing date.  TKK, TMKCo and TMK are entities controlled by the chief executive officer of National Beef.
A portion of the purchase price payable to USPB and NBPCo was placed on deposit with an escrow agent to secure certain indemnification obligations.  Upon consummation of the transactions on the closing date, USPB owned 15.1% and NBPCo owned 5.3% of National Beef.  Since transactions (b) and (c) above occurred after the Company acquired a controlling interest in National Beef, those transactions are reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
The following table reflects the preliminary allocation of the consideration paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in National Beef (in thousands):
 
F-18
 
To assist the Companys management in its determination of the fair value of National Beefs property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and equity value, the Company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm.  The methods used by the Companys management to determine the fair values included estimating National Beefs business enterprise value through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis.  Property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current market prices.  The Company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment, including local market conditions, recent market transactions, the size, age, condition, utility and character of the property, the estimated cost to acquire replacement property, an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets.
Amounts allocated to product inventories were principally based on quoted commodity prices on the acquisition date.  For other components of working capital, the historical carrying values approximated fair values.  National Beefs long-term debt principally consists of its senior credit facility payable to its bank group, which was renegotiated in June 2011.  In December 2011, the lenders consented to the acquisition as required by the credit facility, and to certain other amendments to the facilitys covenants; the pricing of the credit facility remained the same.  In addition to these factors, the Company also analyzed changes in market interest rates from June 2011 and concluded that the principal amount due under the credit facility approximated its fair value on the acquisition date.
The fair value of TKK and TMKCos redeemable noncontrolling interests was the amount paid to redeem those interests as described above.  The fair value of other redeemable noncontrolling interests was determined based upon the purchase price paid by the Company for its interest.
Amounts allocated to intangible assets, the amortization period and goodwill were as follows (dollars in thousands):
All of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company expensed $14,834,000 of costs related to the acquisition of National Beef.
Unaudited pro forma operating results for the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
 
F-19
 
Pro forma adjustments principally reflect an increase to depreciation and amortization expenses related to the fair value of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets.  The unaudited pro forma data is not indicative of future results of operations or what would have resulted if the acquisition had actually occurred as of January 1, 2010.
Seghesio Family Vineyards
In June 2011, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the assets of Seghesio Family Vineyards, the owner and operator of premium estate vineyards and a winery located in Healdsburg, California.  The cash purchase price was $86,018,000, which was primarily allocated as follows: $48,503,000 to property, equipment and leasehold improvements, $22,250,000 to amortizable intangible assets (principally trademarks and tradename, which will be amortized over 17 years), $12,822,000 to inventory and $1,053,000 to goodwill.  Unaudited pro forma income statement data is not included as the amounts were not significant.

Investments in Associated Companies
Income (losses) related to associated companies includes the following for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
 
F-20
 
The Companys equity in losses of Keen includes impairment charges of $36,544,000 in 2009.  Keen became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009.  In the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Keen and classified it as a discontinued operation.
In accordance with GAAP, the Company is allowed to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value (the fair value option) that would not otherwise be required to be measured at fair value.  If the fair value option is elected for a particular financial instrument or other item, the Company is required to report unrealized gains and losses on those items in earnings.  The Companys investments in Jefferies, Mueller and its former investment in ACF are the only eligible items for which the fair value option was elected, commencing on the date the investments became subject to the equity method of accounting.  The Company believes accounting for these investments at fair value better reflects the economics of these investments, and quoted market prices for these investments provide an objectively determined fair value at each balance sheet date.  In addition, electing the fair value option eliminates the uncertainty involved with impairment considerations.  The Companys investment in HomeFed is the only other investment in an associated company that is also a publicly traded company but for which the Company did not elect the fair value option.  HomeFeds common stock is not listed on any stock exchange, and price information for the common stock is not regularly quoted on any automated quotation system.  It is traded in the over-the-counter market with high and low bid prices published by the National Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board Service; however, trading volume is minimal.  For these reasons the Company did not elect the fair value option for HomeFed.
Mueller
During 2011, the Company acquired 10,422,859 common shares of Mueller, representing approximately 27.3% of the outstanding common shares of Mueller, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (Symbol: MLI), for aggregate cash consideration of $408,558,000.  Mueller is a leading manufacturer of copper, brass, plastic, and aluminum products.  In September 2011, the Company entered into a standstill agreement with Mueller for the two year period ending September 1, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to certain provisions the Company has agreed not to sell its shares if the buyer would own more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares, and not to increase its ownership interest to more than 27.5% of the outstanding Mueller common shares.  In addition, the Company has the right to nominate two directors to the board of directors of Mueller and Mueller has agreed to give the Company registration rights covering all of the Mueller shares of common stock owned by the Company.
 
F-21
 
Jefferies
As of December 31, 2011 the Company owns an aggregate of 58,006,024 Jefferies common shares (approximately 29% of the Jefferies outstanding common shares) for a total investment of $980,109,000.  During 2011, the Company purchased an aggregate of 8,654,639 Jefferies common shares through a public offering, in private transactions and in the open market for total cash consideration of $167,753,000.  Jefferies, a company listed on the NYSE (Symbol: JEF), is a full-service global investment bank and institutional securities firm serving companies and their investors.  Jefferies has entered into a registration rights agreement covering all of the Jefferies common stock owned by the Company.
Berkadia
Berkadia, a joint venture between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway) and the Company, acquired a commercial mortgage origination and servicing business in December 2009.  The Company and Berkshire Hathaway each have a 50% equity interest in Berkadia, and each party contributed $217,169,000 of equity capital to fund the acquisition.  In addition, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway provided Berkadia with a five-year, $1 billion secured credit facility, which was used to fund outstanding mortgage loans and servicer advances, purchase mortgage servicing rights and for working capital needs.  Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  Berkadia also originates loans that are sold to U.S. government agencies, and other loans that provide bridge financing or loans that are intended to be sold to other parties.
Berkadia acquired the commercial mortgage origination and servicing business pursuant to an Asset Put Agreement (APA) entered into between Berkadia and the seller in September 2009.  The seller paid Berkadia $40,000,000 for the right to require Berkadia to purchase the commercial mortgage origination and mortgage servicing business pursuant to the terms of the APA.  The seller subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and exercised the put option.  Although there were other parties interested in purchasing portions of the commercial mortgage origination and servicing business, Berkadias offer was the only offer for the entire business, which eliminated the sellers risk of having to dispose of the remaining business.  In addition, Berkadias offer included a provision to hire the employees operating the business, thereby saving the seller significant employment related expenses.
Berkadia applied the acquisition method to account for the purchase of the commercial mortgage origination and servicing business and recorded the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value, which were principally mortgage servicing rights, mortgage loans and servicer advances.  The fair values of the net assets acquired exceeded the amount paid, principally due to the amount received as a put premium and the reasons identified above.  This excess was treated as a bargain purchase that was recognized as a gain on the date of acquisition and included in Berkadias results of operations.  For the 2009 period, the Companys recorded income from Berkadia includes $24,423,000 representing the Companys share of the bargain purchase.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, Berkadias secured credit facility was amended to increase the size of the credit facility to $1.5 billion, with the Company agreeing to provide the increased funds under the facility.  At December 31, 2010, the Company had loaned $250,000,000 to Berkadia under this facility.  In June 2011, Berkadia fully repaid the amount outstanding under its secured credit facility, including $250,000,000 that was loaned by the Company, with funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of Berkadia.  Effective as of December 31, 2011, the secured credit facility was terminated.  All of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by Berkadia to fund new mortgage loans, servicer advances, investments and other working capital requirements.  Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $2,500,000,000 surety policy issued by a Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsidiary and corporate guaranty, and the Company has agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for one-half of any losses incurred thereunder.  As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $2,000,000,000.

JHYH
During 2007, the Company and Jefferies formed JHYH and each initially committed to invest $600,000,000.  The Company invested $350,000,000 during 2007; any request for additional capital contributions from the Company requires the consent of the Companys designees to the Jefferies board.  The Company does not anticipate making additional capital contributions.  JHYH owns Jefferies High Yield Trading, LLC (JHYT), a registered broker-dealer that is engaged in the secondary sales and trading of high yield securities and special situation securities, including bank debt, post-reorganization equity, public and private equity, equity derivatives, credit default swaps and other financial instruments.

JHYT does not invest or make markets in sub-prime residential mortgage securities.
Jefferies and the Company each have the right to nominate two of a total of four directors to JHYHs board, and each own 50% of the voting securities.  The organizational documents also permit passive investors to invest up to $800,000,000.  Jefferies also received additional JHYH securities entitling it to 20% of the profits.  The voting and non-voting interests are entitled to a pro rata share of the balance of the profits of JHYH, and are mandatorily redeemable in 2013, with a mutual option to extend up to three additional one-year periods.  Under GAAP, JHYH is considered a variable interest entity that is consolidated by Jefferies, since Jefferies is the primary beneficiary.  The Company owns less than 50% of JHYHs capital, including its indirect interest through its investment in Jefferies, and will not absorb a majority of its expected losses or receive a majority of its expected residual returns.
During 2011 and 2010, the Company received distributions of $8,972,000 and $17,077,000, respectively, from JHYH.  The Company has not provided any guarantees, nor is it contingently liable for any of JHYHs liabilities, all of which are non-recourse to the Company.  The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in JHYH is limited to the book value of its investment ($323,262,000 at December 31, 2011).
Linkem
During 2011, the Company acquired 37% of the common shares of Linkem, a wireless broadband services provider in Italy, for aggregate cash consideration of $88,575,000.

Las Cruces
 
Las Cruces is a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mineral rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain.  Las Cruces was a consolidated subsidiary from its acquisition in September 1999 until August 2005, at which time the Company sold a 70% interest to Inmet Mining Corporation (Inmet), a Canadian-based global mining company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (Symbol: IMN).  Inmet acquired the interest in Las Cruces in exchange for 5,600,000 newly issued Inmet common shares.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company sold to Inmet its remaining 30% equity interest in and subordinated sponsor loans to Las Cruces for aggregate consideration of $576,003,000.

In addition, the Company was released from its guarantee of $72,000,000 of debt owed by Las Cruces to an affiliate of Inmet.  The Company reported a gain on the sale of $383,369,000 in investment and other income.

Discontinued Operations
In August 2010, the Company sold its operating retail shopping center in Long Island, New York for cash consideration of $17,064,000 and recorded a pre-tax and after tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $4,526,000.  The Company has not classified this business historical results of operations or its assets and liabilities as discontinued operations because such amounts were not significant.
 
F-24
 
In September 2010, the Company sold ResortQuest for net cash consideration of $52,371,000 and recorded a pre-tax and after tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $35,367,000.  As a result, the Companys property management and services segment has been classified as a discontinued operation.
In October 2010, the Company sold STi Prepaid for aggregate consideration of $20,000,000, which was scheduled to be paid over a 26 month period, and classified the telecommunications segment as a discontinued operation.  The Company reported a pre-tax and after tax gain of $21,104,000 in 2010 on sale of discontinued operations equal to the Companys negative net investment in STi Prepaid ($19,255,000) and cash payments received from the buyer.  During 2011, additional final payments were received from the buyer and the Company recognized a gain from discontinued operations of $9,669,000.
In 2010, the Company classified its power production business that burns waste biomass to produce electricity as a held for sale discontinued operation and recorded a charge of $25,321,000 to reduce the carrying amount of the business to its fair value.  The power production business was previously classified in the other operations segment, and the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net and intangible assets to zero.
When the power production facility was originally acquired for $4,567,000 it was not operating and the original intent was to invest additional funds to rehabilitate the facility and bring it up to nameplate capacity.  Despite rehabilitation funding in excess of amounts originally planned, ongoing equipment problems resulted in a failure to bring the facility up to capacity and higher operating costs.  The cost of the waste biomass required to produce electricity also increased, and the business would have required additional funding to continue operating during 2011.  As a result, in 2010 the Company decided to sell the business rather than continue to fund operating losses in the hope that production improvements and/or waste material price decreases would make the facility profitable.
In the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Keen for aggregate consideration of $137,500,000; the sale closed in October 2012.  As a result, the Companys oil and gas drilling services segment has been classified as a discontinued operation.  Pre-tax income from discontinued operations for 2009 reflects a gain of $49,345,000 resulting from a bargain purchase.
A summary of the results of discontinued operations for ResortQuest, STi Prepaid, Keen and the power production business is as follows for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company received and recognized as income from discontinued operations distributions totaling $4,690,000, $11,640,000 and $11,253,000, respectively, from its subsidiary, Empire Insurance Company (Empire), which has been undergoing a voluntary liquidation since 2001.  The Company had classified Empire as a discontinued operation in 2001 and fully wrote-off its remaining book value based on its expected future cash flows at that time.  Although Empire no longer writes any insurance business, its orderly liquidation over the years has resulted in reductions to its estimated claim reserves that enabled Empire to pay the distributions, with the approval of the New York Insurance Department.  For income tax purposes, the payments are treated as non-taxable distributions paid by a subsidiary.  Since future distributions from Empire, if any, are subject to New York insurance law or the approval of the New York Insurance Department, income will only be recognized when received.
During 2009, the Company received 636,300 of its common shares in connection with the resolution of a lawsuit related to its former subsidiary, WilTel Communications Group, Inc. (WilTel), and recorded income from discontinued operations of $15,222,000 based on the market value of the common shares.  These shares were originally issued in connection with the acquisition of WilTel in 2003, and had been held in a fund for certain claims made against WilTel prior to the Companys ownership.  The resolution of the lawsuit found that the claimants were not entitled to the shares and they were returned to the Company.

In August 2006, pursuant to a subscription agreement with Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (Fortescue) and its subsidiary, FMG, the Company invested an aggregate of $408,030,000, including expenses, in Fortescues Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia.  In exchange for its cash investment, the Company received 264,000,000 common shares of Fortescue, and a $100,000,000 unsecured note of FMG that matures in August 2019 (the FMG Note).  In July 2007, Fortescue sold new common shares in an underwritten public offering to raise additional capital for its mining project and to fund future growth.  In connection with this offering, the Company exercised its pre-emptive rights to maintain its ownership position and acquired an additional 13,986,000 common shares of Fortescue for $44,217,000.  Fortescue is a publicly traded company on the Australian Stock Exchange (Symbol: FMG).
During 2010, the Company sold 30,000,000 common shares of Fortescue for net cash proceeds of $121,498,000, which resulted in the recognition of a net securities gain of $94,918,000.  During 2011, the Company sold 117,400,000 common shares of Fortescue for net cash proceeds of $732,217,000, which resulted in the recognition of net securities gains of $628,197,000.  At December 31, 2011, non-current available for sale investments include 130,586,000 common shares of Fortescue.  In January 2012, the Company sold 100,000,000 Fortescue common shares for net cash proceeds of $506,490,000, and will record a net securities gain of $417,887,000 during the three month period ending March 31, 2012.

Interest on the FMG Note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the projects Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas, which commenced production in May 2008.  Interest is payable semi-annually within 30 days of June 30 and December 31 of each year; however, cash interest payments due in 2008 and 2009 were deferred by FMG due to covenants contained in the projects senior secured debt (for periods prior to January 1, 2010).  Any interest payment that was deferred earned simple interest at an annual rate of 9.5%.  Inasmuch as the senior secured debt was redeemed in 2010, the covenants requiring the deferral of interest no longer apply, and FMG has been paying interest when due.

The Companys initial Fortescue investment was allocated to the common shares acquired, using the market value on the acquisition date, a 13 year zero-coupon note and a prepaid mining interest.  The zero-coupon note component of this investment is being accounted for as a loan-like instrument, with income being recognized as the note is accreted up to its face value of $100,000,000, using a rate of 12.5%.  It is classified with other non-current investments.  The prepaid mining interest, which is being amortized to expense as the 4% of revenue is earned (using the units of production method), is classified as other current and non-current assets with an aggregate balance of $152,521,000 and $164,321,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 related to the FMG Note are as follows (in thousands):
The aggregate book values of the various components of the FMG Note, net of accrued withholding taxes on interest, totaled $290,415,000 and $276,148,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
In August 2010, the Company was advised that Fortescue is asserting that FMG is entitled to issue additional notes identical to the FMG Note in an unlimited amount.  Fortescue further claims that any interest to be paid on additional notes can dilute, on a pro rata basis, the Companys entitlement to the above stated interest of 4% of net revenue.  The Company does not believe that FMG has the right to issue additional notes which affect the Companys interest or that the interpretation by Fortescue of the terms of the FMG Note, as currently claimed by Fortescue, reflects the agreement between the parties.
In September 2010, the Company filed a Writ of Summons against Fortescue, FMG and Fortescues then Chief Executive Officer in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  The Writ of Summons seeks, among other things, an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the FMG Note and damages.  If the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the Company and additional notes are issued, the Companys future cash flows from the FMG Note and future results of operations would be significantly and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes.  In addition, the Company would have to evaluate whether the prepaid mining interest had become impaired.  The amount of the impairment, if any, would depend upon the amount of new notes issued and the resulting dilution, plus the Companys projection of future interest payable on the FMG Note.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, non-current investments include 11,042,413 common shares of Inmet, or approximately 15.9% of Inmets outstanding shares. The Inmet shares have registration rights and may be sold without restriction in accordance with applicable securities laws.  See Note 4 for more information about the acquisition of the Inmet shares.
Non-current other non-publicly traded investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting, reduced for impairment charges when appropriate.

Parent Company Debt
The Board of Directors has authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such purchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Companys liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.  Principal amounts purchased during the last three years are as follows (dollars in thousands):
As a result of the purchases, the Company recognized pre-tax losses of $6,352,000 and $5,138,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which are reflected in selling, general and other expenses, and recognized pre-tax gains of $6,693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, which are reflected in investment and other income.
In January 2012, the Company called for redemption the Senior Notes due 2017 and the Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2027 pursuant to pre-existing call rights.  Excluding accrued interest the Company will pay an aggregate of $528,308,000 to redeem the bonds in March 2012.
In April 2004, the Company sold $350,000,000 principal amount of its 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 in a private placement transaction.  The notes are convertible into the Companys common shares at $22.55 per share at any time before their maturity, subject to certain restrictions contained in the notes, at a conversion rate of 44.3459 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of notes subject to adjustment.  Such amount reflects an adjustment to the conversion price as a result of the dividends paid in December 2011 and 2010.  Future cash dividends will reduce the conversion price per share by the amount of the dividend paid per share.  At December 31, 2011, the notes are convertible into an aggregate of 4,327,317 shares.
Pursuant to privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion, the Company issued 5,378,606 common shares upon the conversion of $123,529,000 principal amount of the notes during 2009.  The number of common shares issued was in accordance with the terms of the notes; however, the Company paid the former noteholders $25,990,000 to induce conversion.  The additional cash payments were recorded as selling, general and other expenses.
The Companys senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more Indebtedness or issue Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries unless, at the time of such incurrence or issuance, the Company meets a specified ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, limit the ability of the Company and Material Subsidiaries to incur, in certain circumstances, Liens, limit the ability of Material Subsidiaries to incur Funded Debt in certain circumstances, and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures.  The Company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions.  If the Company is unable to meet the specified ratio, the Company would not be able to issue additional Indebtedness or Preferred Stock, but the Companys inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures.  The senior note indentures do not restrict the payment of dividends.

Subsidiary Debt
At December 31, 2011, National Beefs credit facility consisted of a $323,750,000 outstanding term loan and a revolving line of credit of up to $250,000,000; any amounts outstanding under the facility mature in June 2016.  The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of $9,250,000.  The term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the credit facility), plus a margin ranging from .75% to 2.50% depending upon certain financial ratios and the rate selected.  At December 31, 2011, the interest rate on the term loan was 2.1% and the interest rate in the revolving credit facility was 2.2%.  The credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of National Beef and its subsidiaries.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available for National Beefs working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.  Unused capacity under the facility can also be used to issue letters of credit; letters of credit aggregating $22,976,000 were outstanding at December 31, 2011.  Amounts available under the revolver are subject to a borrowing base calculation primarily comprised of receivable and inventory balances.  At December 31, 2011, after deducting outstanding amounts and issued letters of credit the remainder of the unused revolver was fully available to National Beef.
The credit facility contains customary covenants relating to National Beef and its subsidiaries, including restrictions on  distributions, mergers, asset sales, investments, acquisitions, encumbrances, affiliate transactions and other matters.  The ability of National Beef and its subsidiaries to engage in other business, incur debt or grant liens is also restricted.  National Beef is also required to maintain a minimum Adjusted Net Worth, a maximum Funded Debt Ratio and minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, all as defined in the credit facility.  At December 31, 2011, National Beef met all of these requirements.
During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 collateralized by certain of its corporate aircraft.  The debt matured during 2011.  Other subsidiary debt at December 31, 2011 principally includes Industrial Revenue Bonds of National Beef ($12,245,000). Other subsidiary debt at December 31, 2010 principally included debt secured by MB1s real estate development project ($100,524,000).
Excluding repurchase agreements discussed below, at December 31, 2011, $1,786,858,000 of consolidated assets (primarily inventory, receivables, property and equipment and intangibles) are pledged for indebtedness aggregating $433,399,000, principally for amounts due under National Beefs credit facility.
The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five year period ending December 31, 2016 are as follows:  2012 - $29,264,000; 2013 - $445,305,000; 2014 - $136,888,000; 2015 - $499,071,000; and 2016 - $283,918,000.  Aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt do not include bonds called for redemption in 2012.
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase:
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions.  At December 31, 2011, these fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 0.3%, mature in January 2012 and are collateralized by non-current investments.  The non-current investments are adjustable rate mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA).  This portfolio has a weighted-average life of approximately 5 years and a duration of .76 at December 31, 2011.
The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings (primarily consisting of securities sold under agreements to repurchase) was .3% and .4% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiary
Redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiary are held by minority owners of National Beef, principally USPB, NBPCo Holdings and the chief executive officer of National Beef.  The holders of these interests share in the profits and losses of National Beef on a pro rata basis with the Company.  However, the minority owners have the right to require the Company to purchase their interests under certain specified circumstances at fair value (put rights), and the Company also has the right to purchase their interests under certain specified circumstances at fair value (call rights).  Each of the holders of the put rights has the right to make an election that requires the Company to purchase up to one-third of their interests on the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the Companys acquisition of National Beef, and the remainder on the tenth anniversary of the Companys acquisition of National Beef.  In addition, USPB may elect to exercise their put rights following the termination of the cattle supply agreement, and the chief executive officer following the termination of his employment.
The Companys call rights with respect to USPB may be exercised following the termination of the cattle supply agreement or after USPBs ownership interest is less than 20% of their interest held at the time the Company acquired National Beef.  The Companys call rights with respect to other members may be exercised after the ten year anniversary of the Companys acquisition of National Beef if such members ownership interest is less than 50% of the interest held at the time the Company acquired National Beef.  Additionally, the Company may acquire the chief executive officers interest following the termination of his employment.
Redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiary are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.  In future periods, redeemable noncontrolling interests will reflect cash distributions and the allocation of profits or losses to the minority owners on a pro rata basis.  In addition, redeemable noncontrolling interests will be adjusted for any changes in estimated fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to the Companys common shareholders equity.

Common Shares, Stock Options and Preferred Shares
The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions of the Companys common shares.  During the three year period ended December 31, 2011, the Company acquired 4,949 common shares at an average price of $34.92 per common share, all in connection with stock option exercises.  At December 31, 2011, the Company is authorized to repurchase 11,987,880 common shares.
As of December 31, 2011, the Company has two share-based plans: a fixed stock option plan and a senior executive warrant plan.  The fixed stock option plan provides for the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights to non-employee directors and certain employees at not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.  Options granted to employees under this plan are intended to qualify as incentive stock options to the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and become exercisable in five equal annual instalments starting one year from date of grant.  Options granted to non-employee directors become exercisable in four equal annual instalments starting one year from date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted.  As of December 31, 2011, 1,057,250 shares were available for grant under the plan.
On March 6, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved, subject to shareholder approval, the grant of warrants to purchase 2,000,000 common shares to each of the Companys Chairman and President at an exercise price equal to $28.515 per share (105% of the closing price per share of a common share on that date).  In May 2006, shareholder approval was received and the warrants were issued; the warrants vested over a four year period and were scheduled by their terms to expire on March 5, 2011.  In February 2011, each of the Companys Chairman and President exercised these warrants, on a cashless exercise basis, pursuant to which they each received 261,599 common shares (determined using a value per share of $32.806 as set forth in the warrant).  All of the common shares obtained upon exercise of the warrants were immediately sold in a private transaction.

On March 7, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors granted warrants to purchase 2,000,000 common shares to each of the Companys Chairman and President at an exercise price of $33.84 per share (105% of the closing price per share of a common share on the grant date), subject to shareholder approval.  In May 2011, the required shareholder approval was received and the warrants were issued.  The warrants expire in 2016 and vest in five equal tranches with 20% vesting on the date shareholder approval was received and an additional 20% vesting in each subsequent year.  Compensation cost was determined as of the approval date and will be recognized in the financial statements over the vesting period of the warrants.  For 2011, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of $18,941,000 related to this grant of warrants.
Salaries and incentive compensation expense included $23,019,000, $4,067,000 and $10,905,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Companys senior executive warrant plan and fixed stock option plan.  Net income decreased by $15,203,000, $3,955,000 and $10,905,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a result of the share-based compensation expense.  As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation plans was $43,555,000; this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.
A summary of activity with respect to the Companys stock options for the three years ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:
The following summary presents the weighted-average assumptions used for grants made during each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011:
 
F-36
 
The expected life assumptions were based on historical behavior and incorporated post-vesting forfeitures for each type of award and population identified.  The expected volatility was based on the historical behavior of the Companys stock price.  The assumptions used to value options in 2011 were also used to value the warrants granted during 2011, resulting in a fair value per warrant granted of $13.35.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, 3,308,755 and 3,564,150, respectively, of the Companys common shares were reserved for stock options, 4,327,317 and 4,279,868, respectively, of the Companys common shares were reserved for the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes and 4,000,000 of the Companys common shares were reserved for warrants.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, 6,000,000 of preferred shares (redeemable and non-redeemable), par value $1 per share, were authorized and not issued.
One of the Companys subsidiaries maintains a stock option plan for its employees that provides for the granting of stock options that are exercisable into common shares of the subsidiary; however, amounts related to this plan have not been significant.  Salaries and incentive compensation expense include amounts for this plan of $245,000, $193,000 and $201,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The subsidiary also granted stock appreciation rights to an executive officer that have a seven year term and become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events.  The rights are payable in cash unless the subsidiarys shares are publicly listed, in which case the subsidiary may elect to settle the rights in stock.  Because management has determined that the occurrence of the events required for the stock appreciation rights to become exercisable was not probable as of December 31, 2010, no expense or liability relating to the rights has been recorded.  Stock appreciation rights were also granted to a former executive officer; changes to the fair value of these rights are recorded as increases or decreases to selling, general and other expenses.  Increases (decreases) to the fair value of these rights were $(4,447,000), $261,000 and $3,102,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Income Taxes
The principal components of deferred taxes at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
As of December 31, 2011, the Company had consolidated federal NOLs of $1,228,800,000 that may be used to offset the taxable income of any member of the Companys consolidated tax group.  In addition, the Company has $3,509,350,000 of federal NOLs that are only available to offset the taxable income of certain subsidiaries.  Unused NOLs that expire prior to 2020 aggregate $2,568,000.  The Company also has various state NOLs that expire at different times, which are reflected in the above table to the extent the Company estimates its future taxable income will be apportioned to those states.  Uncertainties that may affect the utilization of the Companys tax attributes include future operating results, tax law changes, rulings by taxing authorities regarding whether certain transactions are taxable or deductible and expiration of carryforward periods.
At December 31, 2010, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would have future taxable income sufficient to realize a significant portion of the Companys net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,157,111,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense.  See Note 2 for more information.
Under certain circumstances, the ability to use the NOLs and future deductions could be substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to occur.  In order to reduce this possibility, the Companys certificate of incorporation includes a charter restriction that prohibits transfers of the Companys common stock under certain circumstances.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 was as follows, excluding amounts allocated to income (losses) related to associated companies and discontinued operations (in thousands):
 
F-39
 
At December 31, 2009, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its net federal deferred tax asset, including its available NOLs.  As a result, the Company did not record any regular federal income tax expense for 2009.  Prior to September 30, 2010, the Company had been recording provisions or benefits for deferred federal minimum taxes payable, due to unrealized security gains reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and in income related to associated companies.  If these gains were realized, the Company would be able to use its NOLs to fully offset the federal income taxes that would be due, but prior to the election described below the Company would have to pay federal minimum taxes.  Although the payment of federal minimum taxes generates a minimum tax credit carryover, prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 it would have been fully reserved for in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded provisions for deferred federal minimum taxes payable of $22,678,000 and $11,594,000 in accumulated other comprehensive income and income related to associated companies, respectively.
The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 provided taxpayers a special election for extended net operating loss carryback benefits, and with respect to any net operating loss for which the election was made, eliminated the limitation that applies to using the NOL to reduce alternative minimum taxable income.  In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service provided additional guidance with respect to application of the law, and the Company made the election with respect to its 2008 NOL.  As a result, approximately $1,940,000,000 of the NOLs referred to above can be used to fully offset federal minimum taxable income, and no federal regular or minimum income tax would be payable on such income.  During 2010, the Company reversed deferred federal minimum tax liabilities which had been recorded in prior periods of $11,594,000 to income related to associated companies and $22,678,000 to accumulated other comprehensive income.
The table below reconciles the expected statutory federal income tax to the actual income tax provision (benefit) (in thousands):
Reflected above as resolution of tax contingencies are reductions to the Companys income tax provision for the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax contingencies.
The following table reconciles the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning and end of the periods presented (in thousands):
 
F-40
 
If recognized, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits reflected in the table above would lower the Companys effective income tax rate.  Over the next twelve months, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions will decrease by approximately $300,000 upon the resolution of certain assessments.  The statute of limitations with respect to the Companys federal income tax returns has expired for all years through 2007.  The Companys New York State and New York City income tax returns are currently being audited for the 2006 to 2008 period.

Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits
Prior to 1999, the Company maintained a defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain units who met age and service requirements.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, $104,424,000 and $68,094,000, respectively, of the net amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet was reflected as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (substantially all of which were cumulative losses) and $63,073,000 and $62,765,000, respectively, was reflected as accrued pension cost.
Employer contributions expected to be paid in 2012 are $3,000,000.
Pension expense related to the defined benefit pension plans charged to results of continuing operations included the following components (in thousands):
At December 31, 2011, the plans assets at fair value consisted of the following (in thousands):

At December 31, 2010, the plans assets at fair value consisted of the following (in thousands):
The estimated fair values for securities measured using Level 1 inputs are determined using publicly quoted market prices in active markets.  Certain of the corporate bonds are measured using Level 2 inputs.  Although these bonds trade in brokered markets, the market for certain bonds is sometimes inactive.  The fair values of these investments are based on reported trading prices, bid and ask prices and quotes obtained from independent market makers in the securities.  At December 31, 2011, the plan did not have any fair value measurements using unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The current investment objectives are designed to minimize investment losses due to rising interest rates while providing a stable and predictable stream of investment income.  To further mitigate investment losses, the Company has placed certain investment restrictions and limitations over plan assets.  The restrictions and limitations include the following:
 
F-43
 
The IG and FI portfolios are managed to maximize the value of plan assets by minimizing exposure to changes in market interest rates.  This investment strategy provides the Company with more flexibility in managing the plan should interest rates rise and result in a decrease in the discounted value of benefit obligations.
To develop the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the following underlying assumptions: 2.5% current expected inflation, 1.5% to 1.7% real rate of return for short duration risk-free investments, .2% inflation risk premium and .75% default risk premium for the portion of the portfolio invested in corporate bonds.  The Company then weighted these assumptions based on invested assets and assumed that investment expenses were offset by expected returns in excess of benchmarks, which resulted in the selection of the 4.25% expected long-term rate of return assumption for 2011.
Changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $5,928,000.
The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.  Excluding the defined pension benefit plan terminated in 2010, the assumptions used relating to the defined benefit pension plan is as follows:
The following pension benefit payments are expected to be paid (in thousands):

Derivative Instruments
 
As part of National Beefs operations, it is exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices.  To manage these risks, National Beef may enter into forward purchase contracts for cattle and exchange traded futures contracts for cattle or grain.  While these instruments help mitigate market risks, they are not designated and accounted for as hedges; accordingly, the gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded to net sales or cost of goods sold in the period of change.  Certain firm commitments for live cattle purchases and all firm commitments for boxed beef sales are designated as normal purchases and sales and not recorded at fair value.
Exchange-traded contracts have been entered into under a master netting agreement.  None of the derivatives entered into have credit-related contingent features.  National Beef has $10,683,000 in cash collateral posted for its derivative liabilities which is included in prepaids and other current assets as of December 31, 2011.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts were calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  The numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three year periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
 
F-46
 
Options to purchase 1,639,375, 1,865,625 and 2,247,590 weighted-average shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted per share amounts as the effect was antidilutive.
The denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share does not include weighted-average common shares of 4,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to outstanding warrants to purchase common shares at $33.84 per share, as the effect was antidilutive.  Warrants to purchase 4,000,000 and 4,000,000 weighted-average common shares at $28.515 per share were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted per share amounts as the effect was antidilutive.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, 4,283,518 shares related to the 3% Convertible Notes were not included in the computation of diluted per share amounts as the effect was antidilutive.
Outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights of a subsidiary are not included above since the subsidiary operates at a net loss and the effect is antidilutive.

F-48
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have significant fair value measurements using unobservable inputs (Level 3) for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  As more fully discussed in Notes 3 and 14, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests of National Beef was determined based on the amount paid by the Company for its interest, which was acquired on December 30, 2011.  In future periods, these interests will be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
The estimated fair values for securities measured using Level 1 inputs are determined using publicly quoted market prices in active markets.  The Company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government agencies (GNMA) and by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA) which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.  Although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active, market prices are not always available for the identical security.  The fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers.  The estimates of fair value of the portfolios of mortgage pass-through certificates and corporate bonds are considered to be based on Level 2 inputs.
At December 31, 2011, the Company did not have significant assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Aggregate information concerning assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis is presented below (in thousands):
The information in the tables above includes assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of the indicated balance sheet dates.  However, prior to year-end the Company recorded impairment charges for assets that resulted in write-downs to fair value in earlier periods.  For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, net securities gains (losses) include impairment charges for investments aggregating $3,586,000, $2,474,000 and $31,420,000, respectively; see Note 2 for further information.
 
F-49
 
During 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges for other assets and investments in associated companies aggregating $139,000,000, which were principally classified as selling, general and other expenses and losses related to associated companies.  This amount primarily consisted of $68,800,000 related to long-lived assets, principally with respect to MB1, $36,544,000 related to the Companys investment in Keen (while it was classified as an associated company) and $32,348,000 related to the Companys investment in Garcadia (an associated company); see Notes 2 and 3 for further information.
The following table presents fair value information about certain financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet.  Fair values are determined as described below.  These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  The fair value amounts presented do not purport to represent and should not be considered representative of the underlying market or franchise value of the Company.  The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of each class of the financial instruments described below are as follows:
Other non-current investments which do not trade publicly include private equity fund investments where the Companys voting interest isnt large enough to apply the equity method of accounting, a portfolio of non-agency mortgage-backed bond securitizations where the underlying assets are various individual mortgage loans, the zero-coupon note component of the FMG Note, and various other non-publicly traded investments.  For the investments in private equity funds and the FMG zero-coupon note, the Company has concluded that the carrying amount approximates the fair value of these investments based primarily on reviews of issuer financial statements or statements of net asset value.  For the bond securitization portfolio, future cash flows are re-estimated on a regular basis for each security to determine if impairment charges are required; accordingly the Company has concluded that the carrying amount of these securities approximates their fair values.  The fair values of the Companys other non-publicly traded investments that are accounted for under the cost method were assumed to be at least equal to the carrying amount.  For these non-publicly traded investments, the Company reviews cash flows and/or other information obtained from investee companies on a regular basis to determine if impairment charges are required.
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
