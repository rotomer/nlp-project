Item 5.02. 
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)           The 2003 Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, as amended (the Bonus Plan) of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company) provides for an annual incentive bonus to each of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg in an amount equal to 1.35% of the audited pre-tax earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for each year through 2014, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion. 
As previously reported, the Compensation Committee awarded performance bonuses under the Bonus Plan for 2009 and 2010 to each of Ian M. Cumming, Chairman of the Board of the Company, and Joseph S. Steinberg, President of the Company.  For each of those years, the Compensation Committee certified an amount under the Bonus Plan that exceeded the amount actually paid for such year to Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg.  In doing so, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to pay out less than the maximum amount certified as having been earned under the Bonus Plan for each such year, instead choosing to reconsider, at an appropriate time in the future, whether to pay any of the remaining portion of the 2009 bonus and/or the 2010 bonus (an aggregate of $9,021,089 for each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg) (each, the Remaining Bonus), retaining full discretion to consider all relevant and appropriate facts when determining whether to award some or all of the Remaining Bonus to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg.
On December 3, 2012, the Compensation Committee awarded the Remaining Bonus to each of Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg.
