Exhibit 10.1
It has been the policy of Leucadia National Corporation (the Company)
since the current management took over in 1978 to emphasize performance based
compensation through the payment of discretionary bonuses.
On December 18, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors, upon the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Ian M.
Cumming, Chairman of the Board, and Joseph S. Steinberg, President of the
Company, approved annual salary increases (effective January 1, 2013) and
discretionary 2012 cash bonuses for each of the Companys executive officers who
were included as named executive officers in the Companys 2012 proxy statement
(other than Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg ).
