CONTACT: Investor Relations Public Relations (214) 792-4415 (214) 792-4847 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $24 MILLION; DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.03 DALLAS, TEXAS -- April 21, 2003 -- Southwest Airlines' net income for first quarter 2003 was $24 million, compared to first quarter 2002 net income of $21 million, an increase of 14.3 percent. Diluted net income per share was $.03 in both first quarter 2003 and first quarter 2002. These results were in line with First Call's consensus estimate of $.03 for first quarter 2003. Total operating revenues for first quarter 2003 increased 7.5 percent to $1.35 billion, compared to $1.26 billion for first quarter 2002. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 4.8 percent in first quarter 2003, compared to a 5.3 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a load factor of 62.6 percent versus the first quarter 2002 load factor of 62.9 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 2.6 percent to 11.99 cents from 11.69 cents in first quarter 2002. Operating revenue yield per ASM increased 2.1 percent to 7.77 cents from 7.61 cents in first quarter 2002. Operating expenses per ASM for first quarter 2003 increased 2.6 percent to 7.50 cents from 7.31 cents in first quarter 2002, primarily due to higher labor and jet fuel costs, net of hedging gains. The Company's hedging program resulted in the recognition of approximately $77 million in gains during first quarter 2003, of which $64 million was recorded in "Fuel and oil." The remaining gains are included in "Other (gains) losses, net" in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), as amended. Excluding fuel, operating expenses per ASM for first quarter 2003 were 6.30 cents, approximately the same as first quarter 2002. James F. Parker, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "Considering the current financial crisis of the airline industry and the adverse effects world events continue to have on demand for air travel, we are grateful to report a 14.3 percent increase in our first quarter 2003 earnings to $24 million. This earnings performance marks our 48th consecutive quarterly profit, which represents an enormous accomplishment for our Shareholders and Shareholder-Employees. "Although our financial performance has been exceptional relative to the airline industry as a whole, Southwest, too, has been severely impacted by the lingering effects of the 2001 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq. Although our revenues were showing signs of recovery during fourth quarter 2002 and into first quarter 2003, those trends were disrupted. "Since the war began, bookings for second quarter 2003 have softened further. Currently, we expect only modest revenue growth, if any, compared to last year's second quarter revenue of $1.47 billion, which included $36 million in additional revenue related to a reduction in estimated refunds and exchanges included in air traffic liability. "On the cost side, we were able to mitigate significantly higher energy costs by hedging 100 percent of our first quarter fuel requirements, saving Southwest approximately $77 million pretax in first quarter of 2003. For second quarter 2003, we are 100 percent hedged in the $24 per barrel range. We are 85 percent hedged for the second half of 2003 with caps under $24 per barrel. We remain 80 percent hedged for 2004, with caps approximating $23 per barrel. "Excluding fuel, we were pleased with our better than expected unit cost performance. Although we continue to face certain cost challenges, our unit cost growth was very modest, partly due to our Employees' disciplined cost /more
reduction efforts. Based on first quarter 2003 costs, we expect modest year over year unit cost growth again in second quarter of 2003. "The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act ("Act") was recently enacted. Among other items, the legislation includes a $2.3 billion cash reimbursement for security fees remitted to the Transportation Security Administration since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Southwest expects to receive its proportional share during second quarter 2003. "Although our revenue outlook remains uncertain, our costs remain under control. As a consequence, and barring any unforeseen event, we expect to be profitable in the second quarter of 2003. Given the current disruption in revenue trends, however, and without consideration of funds received pursuant to the Act, it will be difficult to match last year's second quarter profit of $102 million, which included $36 million (pretax) related to a reduction in air traffic liability. "While many of our competitors have reduced their service due to the war in Iraq, Southwest plans to grow our available seat mile capacity by roughly four percent in 2003. In the course of cautiously growing our fleet, we recently exercised options to acquire four more 737-700s in 2004. This change brings our total firm orders to 25 and options to nine for 2004. "Although we are not entirely out of the woods, we have, thus far, effectively weathered the post-September 11 industry crisis for one reason - the People of Southwest Airlines. We have the most dedicated, resilient, and finest group of Employees in the airline industry. Their unity and longterm vision allows us to produce great results in good times so that we can survive even in the worst of times. As a result of our Employees' remarkable efforts and unwavering Southwest Spirit, Southwest was named one of FORTUNE magazine's most admired companies in America and topped the airline category for the seventh consecutive year. Southwest was also recognized again in Business Ethics magazine's listing of "100 Best Corporate Citizens" and HISPANIC magazine's listing of the 2003 Hispanic Corporate 100. I am also pleased that Southwest was named the "Best Low Cost Airline" at the 2003 Official Airline Guide Airline of the Year awards and selected by Air Transport World magazine as its "Airline of the Year" for 2003. Congratulations to each and every Southwest Employee for these wonderful accomplishments - you are indeed the very best!" Net cash provided by operations was $267 million and capital expenditures were $193 million for first quarter 2003. We ended first quarter 2003 with $1.89 billion cash on hand plus our available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. Southwest Airlines will conduct a conference call to discuss its quarterly earnings today at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available via the World Wide Web at www.southwest.com.
