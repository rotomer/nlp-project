Exhibit 99.1 
 
 
DALLAS, TEXAS -- October 20, 2003 -- Southwest Airlines' net income for third quarter 2003 was $106 million, compared to third quarter 2002 net income of $75 million. Net income per diluted share was $.13 for third quarter 2003, compared to $.09 for third quarter 2002. These results are in line with First Call's consensus estimate. The Company's third quarter 2002 net income, excluding a special income item, was $50 million, or $.06 per diluted share.
Total operating revenues for third quarter 2003 increased 11.6 percent to $1.55 billion, compared to $1.39 billion for third quarter 2002. Operating income was $185 million, compared to $91 million in third quarter 2002, an increase of 103.3 percent. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 7.7 percent in third quarter 2003, compared to a 3.4 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a load factor of 70.5 percent versus the third quarter 2002 load factor of 67.7 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 3.8 percent to 11.71 cents from 11.28 cents in third quarter 2002. Operating revenue per ASM (RASM) increased 8.0 percent to 8.53 cents from 7.90 cents in third quarter 2002.
Total third quarter 2003 operating expenses were $1.37 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent, compared to $1.30 billion in third quarter 2002. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for third quarter 2003 increased 1.8 percent to 7.51 cents from the year ago period, primarily due to higher labor and jet fuel costs, net of hedging gains. Excluding fuel and the effect of a 2002 special item, CASM for third quarter 2003 increased 2.4 percent to 6.34 cents versus 6.19 cents in third quarter 2002.
"Other expenses" were $14 million for third quarter 2003 versus "other income" of $33 million for third quarter 2002. "Other losses" increased to $7 million in third quarter 2003 from "other gains" of $46 million in third quarter 2002 primarily due to the 2002 special income item. Interest expense declined 22.2 percent and interest income declined 40.0 percent primarily due to lower interest rates.
Capitalized interest increased to $8 million from $4 million in third quarter 2002 as a result of higher Boeing aircraft progress payments.
James F. Parker, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We are proud to report our third quarter 2003 net income of $106 million, which represents our 50 consecutive quarter of profitability. Our third quarter 2003 earnings were up substantially from the same period last year due to an improved post-war revenue environment and a weak year-ago performance. Third quarter 2003 RASM increased eight percent to 8.53 cents through a combination of higher load factors and passenger yields. Summer demand for vacation travel was strong, resulting in a record July and very solid August load factor performance. Thankfully, post-Labor Day travel also held up reasonably well, although our September traffic was impacted by Hurricane Isabel. We continue to be encouraged by recent RASM and booking trends and expect year-over-year unit revenue growth again in fourth quarter 2003. On a customary seasonal basis, however, we expect fourth quarter 2003 RASM to decline from third quarter 2003.
th
"Excluding the effect of a 2002 special item, our overall unit costs were up 2.3 percent in third quarter 2003. Our average jet fuel cost per gallon increased only 3.7 percent to 72.8 cents in third quarter 2003, as we benefited from third quarter hedging gains of $30 million. Based on prevailing market prices, we currently expect our fourth quarter 2003 average jet fuel cost per gallon to exceed the third quarter 2003 average jet fuel cost per gallon of 72.8 cents. We are 87 percent hedged in fourth quarter 2003 under $24 per barrel and 83 percent hedged for 2004, with caps approximating $23 per barrel.
"Excluding fuel and the effect of the 2002 special item, third quarter 2003 unit costs increased 2.4 percent to 6.34 cents from third quarter 2002. Based on current cost trends, we expect more year-over-year unit cost pressure in fourth quarter 2003 and higher unit cost levels than in third quarter 2003. We continue to realize productivity improvements from Company-wide cost reduction efforts, which we will aggressively pursue to protect our low cost competitive advantage.
"As a result of our Employees' commitment to low costs, low fares, and high quality Customer service, the future for Southwest Airlines is bright. Because of our confidence in the People of Southwest and the gradual improvement in the revenue environment, we recently exercised one Boeing 737-700 option for 2005 delivery and four 2006 options for accelerated delivery to 2004. We also entered into an agreement to lease an additional new -700 in 2004. These changes bring our 2004 aircraft deliveries to 47 and our 2005 firm
orders and options to 23 and 11, respectively. After considering these additions and our planned 737-200 retirements, we expect an annual capacity increase of approximately seven percent in 2004 and over ten percent in 2005.
"In addition to our cash on hand at September 30, 2003, we continue to have our fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. During October 2003, we redeemed $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4 percent Notes due October 15, 2003 at par plus accrued interest."
Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 increased 7.3 percent to $4.42 billion while operating expenses increased 6.8 percent to $4.05 billion, resulting in operating income in 2003 of $372 million.
Net income for the nine-month period was $376 million in 2003 versus $199 million in 2002. Net income per diluted share for the nine-month period was $.46 in 2003 versus $.25 in 2002. Excluding special items in each year, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 increased 49.4 percent to $233 million from $156 million in 2002.
The Company believes it is helpful to management and investors to evaluate ongoing operational performance and trends by excluding special items, as described below, for comparative purposes. A reconciliation of key financial measures, excluding these special items, is included in this release, pursuant to Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were no special items in third quarter 2003.
Pursuant to the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Company received a $271 million cash payment from the U.S. government, which is included as "Other gains" in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This special item, which was recorded in second quarter 2003, resulted in an increase of approximately $41 million to Employee profitsharing expense.
Pursuant to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which was enacted following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company recognized $48 million included in "Other gains" in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for third quarter 2002.
The Company's 2002 nine month results also included an additional $36 million in passenger revenue recognized during second quarter 2002 from a reduction in the estimated future refunds and exchanges included in "Air traffic liability."
Southwest Airlines will conduct a conference call to discuss its quarterly earnings today at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at www.southwest.com.

Exhibit 99.2
DALLAS-Oct. 20, 2003-Southwest Airlines today announced it will no longer pay commissions on all Southwest flights booked by traditional travel agencies.
The new policy will be effective Dec. 15, 2003. Southwest was the last major airline paying base commissions to travel agents (Southwest does not pay commissions for online bookings).
"We appreciate the choice our travel agency partners continue to provide to our Customers," said Jim Parker, Southwest's chief executive officer and vice chairman. "We waited this long to make the change in our commission policy to give all agencies-large and small-ample time to shift their business model to the industry norm of fee-based services."
Even prior to the industry-changing events of Sept. 11, 2001, most travel agencies were charging Customers fees for their services. Now, it is largely the business model upon which agencies operate. Changes in distribution brought about by the popularity of the Internet also have changed the way a Customer purchases travel.
In third quarter 2003, Southwest's online bookings generated 55 percent of the airline's revenues, while travel agency bookings accounted for about 15 percent.
Southwest, the industry's low-cost provider, has been vigilant about keeping operating costs low to ensure low fares for Customers. The change in travel agency commission policy will save Southwest about $40 million annually, Parker said.
Southwest (NYSE: LUV) operates 385 Boeing 737s in 58 cities in 30 states. The airline has nearly 2,800 daily departures, and was named the number one airline in the United States in May and June 2003 for the most passenger boardings in each of those months.
