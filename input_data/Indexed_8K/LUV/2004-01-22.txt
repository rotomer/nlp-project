CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS AND 31st CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF PROFITABILITY DALLAS, TEXAS - January 22, 2004 - Southwest Airlines net income for fourth quarter 2003 was $66 million, compared to $42 million for fourth quarter 2002. Net income per diluted share was $.08 for fourth quarter 2003, compared to $.05 in fourth quarter 2002. The Company also reported its 31st consecutive year of profitability, with annual net income of $442 million or $.54 per diluted share, compared to 2002 net income of $241 million or $.30 per diluted share. Excluding special items in each year, 2003 net income was $298 million or $.36 per diluted share, compared to $198 million or $.24 per diluted share for 2002. Fourth Quarter 2003 Operating Results Total operating revenues for fourth quarter 2003 increased 8.3 percent to $1.52 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for fourth quarter 2002. Operating income increased 26.1 percent to $111 million from $88 million in fourth quarter 2002. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 5.3 percent in fourth quarter 2003, as compared to a 4.0 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a 0.8 point increase in load factor to 63.8 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 2.6 percent to 12.57 cents from 12.25 cents in fourth quarter 2002. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) increased 4.0 percent to 8.29 cents from 7.97 cents in fourth quarter 2002. Total fourth quarter 2003 operating expenses were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7.1 percent compared to $1.3 billion in fourth quarter 2002. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for fourth quarter 2003 increased 2.9 percent to 7.69 cents, compared to 7.47 cents in fourth quarter 2002. Unit cost increases resulted primarily from higher labor, maintenance, airport, and jet fuel costs, net of hedging and fuel efficiency gains. The Company's hedging program resulted in the recognition of $41 million and $29 million in gains during fourth quarter 2003 and 2002, respectively, and annual gains of $171 million and $45 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding fuel, CASM for fourth quarter 2003 increased 2.8 percent to 6.51 cents, compared to 6.33 cents for fourth quarter 2002. /more
"Other expenses" were $10 million and $24 million for fourth quarter 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense declined 25.9 percent due to lower effective interest rates and the October 2003 redemption of $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4 percent Notes due October 15, 2003. Capitalized interest increased to $10 million from $4 million in fourth quarter 2002 as a result of higher Boeing aircraft progress payments. The fourth quarter 2003 income tax rate of 34.9 percent reflected lower effective state income tax rates. James F. Parker, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "Although 2003 represented another year of adversity for our industry, Southwest produced its 31st consecutive year of profitability, which will enable us to reward our dedicated Employees with a $126 million contribution to our Company profitsharing plan. "As the economy recovers and demand for business travel increases, our unit revenue trends gradually continue to improve. Our fourth quarter 2003 RASM increased 4.0 percent from last year's improved performance of 7.97 cents. Although the first half of January 2004 showed modest unit revenue growth, bookings suggest that January's load factor could fall below last year's performance of 58.0 percent. "As expected, we are experiencing some cost pressures. Our low cost competitive advantage will endure, however. Our overall unit costs for fourth quarter 2004 were up 2.9 percent versus last year's fourth quarter due to a variety of items. While this increase is less than anticipated, we are not satisfied with these inflationary trends and are aggressively implementing various measures to improve our productivity. Effective December 15, 2003, Southwest no longer pays a travel agency commission on flights booked by traditional travel agencies, which will reduce operating costs by approximately $40 million annually. We also recently announced the consolidation of our reservation operations from nine into six Reservation Centers. Although we will incur restructuring charges estimated in the $20 million range in first quarter 2004, we expect ongoing annual operating cost savings to exceed that amount. "We continue to be impacted by high energy costs. Although we were well protected and recognized approximately $41 million in effective hedging gains in fourth quarter 2003 fuel and oil expense, our average jet fuel costs per gallon increased 4.7 percent versus last year's fourth quarter. We are also substantially hedged in first quarter 2004 at 82 percent with caps under $24 per barrel. Even with that hedge, based on /more
current market conditions, our estimated first quarter 2004 average jet fuel costs per gallon is in the 75 to 80 cents range. For the remainder of 2004, we are over 80 percent hedged in each quarter with caps approximating $24 per barrel. For 2005, we are approximately 70 percent hedged with caps in the $24 per barrel range. "Excluding estimated reservation operations restructuring costs, we expect overall unit costs to increase again in first quarter 2004 as compared to last year's first quarter. We expect cost pressures will begin to ease in second half 2004. "With our low cost advantage and outstanding service, we are excited about our growth opportunities, particularly our entry into the Philadelphia market in May 2004. As a result, we recently exercised options to acquire five more 737-700s in 2005, which brings our current 2005 firm aircraft orders and options to 28 and 6, respectively. Our total 2004 expected Boeing 737-700 additions remain at 47. After subtracting planned 737-200 retirements, we plan to grow annual capacity in the 7 to 8 percent range in 2004 and approximately 11 percent in 2005. "Our priorities, with respect to our financial position, are to maintain high liquidity levels, a strong balance sheet, and A credit ratings, while still growing the airline and generating value for our Employee and non-Employee Shareholders. We are anticipating substantial proceeds from future exercises of Employee stock options. In consideration of our strong cash position, strong balance sheet, and desire to maximize value for our Employee and non-Employee Shareholders, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of Southwest Airlines common stock from time to time in the open market, from the proceeds of future Employee stock option exercises. "Southwest was included in Global Finance magazine's January 2004 'Expert's List of the World's Most Socially Responsible Companies' and recently recognized as the 'Best Domestic Airline of the Year' by Travel Weekly magazine. We commend our caring and altruistic Employees for these honors. "For information regarding the Company's Corporate Governance Program, please see the new Corporate Governance section, under Investor Relations at southwest.com." Net cash provided by operations for fourth quarter 2003 was $291 million. We ended the year with $1.87 billion in cash plus our available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. /more Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 7.5 percent to $5.9 billion while operating expenses increased 6.8 percent to $5.5 billion, resulting in operating income of $483 million.

Special Items The Company believes it is helpful to management and investors to evaluate ongoing operational performance and trends by excluding special items, as described below, for comparative purposes. A reconciliation of key financial measures, excluding these special items, is included in this release, pursuant to Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were no special items in fourth quarter 2003 or fourth quarter 2002. Pursuant to the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2002, the Company received a $271 million cash payment from the U.S. government, which is included as "Other gains" in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for 2003. This special item, which was recorded in second quarter 2003, resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million to Employee profitsharing expense. Pursuant to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which was enacted following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company recognized $48 million from the U.S. Government, which is included in "Other gains" in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for 2002. This special item was recorded in third quarter 2002. The Company's 2002 results also included an additional $36 million in passenger revenue recognized during second quarter 2002 from a reduction in estimated future refunds and exchanges included in "Air traffic liability." Southwest Airlines will conduct a conference call to discuss its quarterly earnings today at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

NOTE: The above schedule reconciles the financial measures, excluding special items, included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. The special items were a $271 million Wartime Act grant received in second quarter 2003 pursuant to the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, a $48 million Stabilization Act grant received in the third quarter 2002, and $36 million in additional passenger revenue from a reduction in estimated refunds and exchanges included in "Air traffic liability" in second quarter 2002. The $271 million Wartime Act grant was received as a result of the war with Iraq and is recorded in "Other gains." The $48 million Stabilization Act grant was received as a result of the unfavorable impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the airline industry and is recorded in "Other gains." The $36 million passenger revenue adjustment was primarily due to a revision in estimated forfeited tickets, resulting from a change in Customer travel patterns and higher than usual mix of discount, nonrefundable ticket sales following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In management's view, comparative analysis of results can be enhanced by excluding the impact of these special items. None of these items are indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance for the applicable period, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods, including 2004. /more
