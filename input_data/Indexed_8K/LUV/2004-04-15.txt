Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $26 MILLION DALLAS, TEXAS -- April 15, 2004 -- Southwest Airlines' net income for first quarter 2004 was $26 million, compared to first quarter 2003 net income of $24 million, an increase of 8.3 percent. Net income per diluted share was $.03 in both first quarter 2004 and first quarter 2003. The Company's first quarter 2004 net income included $18 million of expenses related to the consolidation of its reservation operations, which was excluded from First Call's mean estimate of $.04 for first quarter 2004. Total operating revenues for first quarter 2004 increased 9.8 percent to $1.48 billion, compared to $1.35 billion for first quarter 2003. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 8.2 percent in first quarter 2004, compared to a 5.6 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a load factor of 64.2 percent versus the first quarter 2003 load factor of 62.6 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 1.0 percent to 12.11 cents from 11.99 cents in first quarter 2003. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) increased 3.9 percent to 8.07 cents from 7.77 cents in first quarter 2003. Total first quarter 2004 operating expenses were $1.44 billion, an increase of 10.2 percent, compared to $1.31 billion for the same year ago period. Effective February 28, 2004, the Company consolidated its nine reservation centers into six, which resulted in an $18 million increase in total operating expenses for the first quarter. These expenses primarily related to Employee severance and relocation packages. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for first quarter 2004 increased 4.3 percent to 7.82 cents from 7.50 cents in first quarter 2003. In addition to the $18 million in costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's reservation operations, the CASM increase was primarily due to higher labor, airport, and jet fuel costs, net of hedging gains and improved fuel efficiency, partially offset by lower commission expense. The Company's hedging program resulted in the recognition of $63 million and $64 million in effective hedging gains in first quarter fuel and oil expense in 2004 and 2003, respectively. /more
"Other expenses" were $5 million and $7 million for first quarter 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense declined 26.9 percent due to lower effective interest rates and the October 2003 redemption of $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4 percent Notes. Capitalized interest increased to $10 million from $7 million in first quarter 2003 as a result of higher Boeing aircraft progress payments. James F. Parker, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "Considering record high energy costs and the challenging revenue environment our industry faced in first quarter 2004, we are grateful to report our 52nd consecutive quarterly profit. Although our revenue recovery has been inconsistent, currently we are encouraged by the tremendous Customer response to our first quarter 2004 fare sales. Our March 2004 load factor of 73.6 percent was a record for the month of March. Based on current traffic and bookings trends, we expect another strong load factor performance in April 2004. We have also been encouraged by the significant pickup in May and June bookings. Although RPM yields may be diluted with a higher mix of discounted fares, barring any adverse, uncontrollable external events, we expect unit revenues for second quarter 2004 to exceed second quarter 2003's performance of 8.47 cents. "Our first quarter 2004 unit cost increase of 4.3 percent was as expected. Even though we mitigated record high energy costs in first quarter 2004 with hedging gains of $63 million, our average jet fuel price for first quarter 2004 increased 6.4 percent to 79.6 cents per gallon. We remain over 80 percent hedged for the remainder of 2004 with prices capped below $24 per barrel. We are also approximately 80 percent hedged for 2005 with prices capped at approximately $25 per barrel. "In addition to our successful hedging program, we have continued our efforts to control costs. Effective December 15, 2003, we eliminated our travel agency commission, which will lower operating costs by approximately $40 million annually. Due to the popularity of southwest.com, we recently consolidated our reservation operations. Although, as a result of such consolidation, we incurred expenses of $18 million during first quarter 2004, savings for the balance of the year could recoup most or all of that amount and, then, exceed it thereafter. We are also in the process of adding Blended Winglets to our 737-700 aircraft. Southwest expects to save three to four percent of jet fuel gallons consumed annually for each aircraft outfitted with the winglets. "Southwest is committed to low fares, and we understand that maintaining our low cost structure is the way to protect our competitive advantage and maintain job security for our People. While we expect second /more
quarter 2004 overall unit costs to be in line with first quarter's 7.82 cents, which reveals another year over year increase, unit cost pressures should ease in second half 2004. "We remain excited about our future growth opportunities and recently exercised options to acquire three more 737-700s in 2005, which brings our current 2005 firm aircraft orders and options to 31 and 3, respectively. We are very pleased with the overwhelming Customer response to our upcoming Philadelphia service. We will launch service on May 9, 2004 and will have 28 daily nonstop flights to 13 cities by mid-summer. "Southwest was once again recognized by FORTUNE as one of America's Most Admired Companies and America's most admired airline. We are very proud of the magnificent People of Southwest. Their greatness and accomplishments are unsurpassed in the airline industry." Net cash provided by operations was $417 million and capital expenditures were $360 million for first quarter 2004. During first quarter 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 8.5 million of its common shares for a total of approximately $125 million with present and anticipated proceeds from Employee stock option exercises. We ended first quarter 2004 with $1.8 billion cash on hand. Half of the Company's $575 million undrawn bank credit facility expires during April 2004 and the other half expires in April 2005. The Company has received commitments to fully replace these lines of credit and expects to close on a new three-year $575 million facility during April 2004. Southwest Airlines will conduct a conference call to discuss its quarterly earnings today at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at southwest.com.
