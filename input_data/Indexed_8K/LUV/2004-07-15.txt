Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS DALLAS, TEXAS - July 15, 2004 -- Southwest Airlines' net income for second quarter 2004 was $113 million, compared to second quarter 2003 net income of $246 million. Net income per diluted share was $.14 for second quarter 2004, compared to $.30 for second quarter 2003. The Company's second quarter 2003 net income included the impact of a $271 million government grant (or $143 million net of profitsharing and income tax effects). Excluding the impact of the government grant, second quarter 2003 net income was $103 million, or $.13 per diluted share. The second quarter 2004 results included the following two charges: - an $11 million expense (or $6 million net of profitsharing and income tax effects) for costs associated with Southwest's recent voluntary company-wide early out offer, - a $12 million expense (or $6 million net of profitsharing and income tax effects), for pay, per diem, and benefit increases retroactive to May 2002 associated with the June 2004 tentative contract agreement reached with TWU Local 556, the union representing Southwest's 7,400 Flight Attendants. Government Grant Pursuant to the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Company received a $271 million cash payment from the U.S. government (government grant), which was recognized as "Other gains" in its unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for second quarter 2003. This item resulted in an increase of approximately $41 million to Employee profitsharing expense. The Company believes it is helpful to management and investors to evaluate ongoing operational performance and trends by excluding the prior year government grant for comparative purposes. A reconciliation of key financial measures excluding the impact of this item is included in this release, pursuant to Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Operating Results Total operating revenues for second quarter 2004 increased 13.3 percent to $1.72 billion, compared to $1.52 billion for second quarter 2003. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 14.1 percent in second quarter 2004, compared to a 4.9 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a load factor of 76.3 percent versus the second quarter 2003 load factor of 70.1 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM decreased 1.1 percent year-over-year to 11.54 cents. Operating revenue per ASM (RASM) increased 7.9 percent year-over-year to 9.14 cents. Total second quarter 2004 operating expenses were $1.52 billion, an increase of 10.5 percent, compared to $1.38 billion for second quarter 2003. Excluding the profitsharing impact of the government grant, operating expenses were $1.33 billion in second quarter 2003. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for second quarter 2004 increased 5.3 percent, to 8.09 cents, from 7.68 cents in second quarter 2003. Excluding the profitsharing impact of the government grant, CASM for second quarter 2003 was 7.46 cents. In addition to the expenses associated with the Company's early out offer, tentative agreement with its Flight Attendants, and significantly higher jet fuel prices, the CASM increase was driven by higher labor, aircraft maintenance, and advertising costs. Although the Company's hedging program resulted in the recognition of $87 million and $36 million in effective hedging gains in second quarter "Fuel and oil" expense in 2004 and 2003, respectively, average jet fuel cost per gallon increased 21.5 percent to 81.9 cents from 67.4 cents in second quarter 2003. Operating income for second quarter 2004 was $197 million, an increase of 40.7 percent, compared to $140 million for second quarter 2003. Excluding the profitsharing impact of last year's government grant, operating income increased 8.8 percent in second quarter 2004 from $181 million in second quarter 2003. "Other expenses" was $18 million for second quarter 2004 versus "other income" of $257 million for second quarter 2003. The $275 million swing in "other expenses" primarily resulted from the government grant in second quarter 2003. James F. Parker, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "Southwest Airlines is grateful to report its 53rd consecutive quarterly profit. Excluding the impact of last year's government grant, our second quarter earnings of $113 million were up 9.7 percent over second quarter 2003 earnings of $103 million. This increase was achieved despite significantly higher jet fuel prices; the Company's July early out offer, which was accepted by over 1,000 Employees; and additional expenses associated with the tentative agreement with our Flight Attendants. This earnings growth was driven by a
welcomed improvement in revenues, which increased 13.3 percent versus a year ago, or 7.9 percent per unit (ASM) to 9.14 cents. "Considering the difficult airline industry revenue environment, we are pleased with our second quarter revenue and traffic results. Our 2004 load factor increased 6.2 points to 76.3 percent and was a record performance. Thus far, favorable load factors and unit revenue trends have continued in July. Bookings for the remainder of July and August are also strong due to high demand for vacation travel. Bookings for September are building nicely as a result of recent fare sales. Based on these trends, we expect year-over- year unit revenue growth, again, in third quarter 2004, although at a slower pace than second quarter due to toughening comparisons. We also expect third quarter 2004's unit revenue to be below second quarter 2004 RASM of 9.14 cents, which is consistent with historical seasonal trends. "As anticipated, our unit costs rose in second quarter 2004 and were higher than budgeted due to higher than expected fuel prices, the Company's early out offer, and higher pay, per diem, and benefit increases retroactive to May 2002 associated with our Flight Attendants. Based on current plans and barring any unforeseen events, third and fourth quarter 2004 unit costs will decline from first half 2004 levels. "We continue to mitigate high energy costs with our successful hedging program and fuel efficiency efforts. We are over 80 percent hedged for the remainder of 2004 with prices capped below $24 per barrel. We are also 80 percent hedged for 2005 with prices capped at approximately $25 per barrel and approximately 45 percent hedged for 2006 with prices capped at around $28 per barrel. "Based on our current revenue and cost outlook and barring any unforeseen event, we expect third quarter 2004 earnings to exceed third quarter 2003 earnings of $106 million. "We are excited about our future growth opportunities and recently exercised options to acquire three more 737-700s in 2005, which brings our current 2005 firm aircraft orders to 34. We are thrilled with the Customer response to our Philadelphia service, which thus far, has been our best start-up ever." Net cash provided by operations was $847 million and capital expenditures were $870 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004. We ended second quarter 2004 with $1.8 billion cash on hand. During second quarter 2004, we fully replaced our unsecured revolving credit line of $575
million, which now expires April 2007. The Company also repurchased approximately 686,000 of its common shares during second quarter 2004, bringing the total to 9.2 million shares, or $136 million, pursuant to the Company's previously announced $300 million repurchase program. Total operating revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased 11.7 percent to $3.2 billion while total operating expenses increased 10.3 percent to $2.96 billion, resulting in operating income in first half 2004 of $243 million versus $186 million in first half 2003. Excluding the profitsharing impact of last year's government grant, first half 2004 operating expenses increased 12.1 percent to $2.96 billion from $2.64 billion in first half 2003, resulting in a 7.0 percent increase in first half 2004 operating income to $243 million from $227 million in first half 2003. Net income for first half 2004 was $139 million ($.17 per diluted share) versus $270 million ($.33 per diluted share) for first half 2003. Excluding the impact of last year's government grant, first half 2004 net income increased 9.4 percent to $139 million from $127 million ($.16 per diluted share) in first half 2003.

Exhibit 99.2 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE CHANGES DALLAS-July 15, 2004- Southwest Airlines today announced that its Vice Chairman of the Board and CEO, James F. Parker, had, for personal reasons, retired effective today as CEO of Southwest and as a member of the Southwest Board of Directors. Herb Kelleher, Chairman of the Southwest Airlines Board, stated that Jim Parker's decision was accepted by the Board with both deep regret and profound gratitude to Jim for his many significant contributions to the success of Southwest and the wellbeing of its People over the course of the last 18 years: "Our entire Board salutes Jim for his myriad accomplishments and for being an outstanding individual," Kelleher said. "We will all greatly miss him." Kelleher also announced that Gary Kelly, 49, had been selected by the Board of Directors to succeed Parker as Vice Chairman of the Board and CEO, as well as a member of the Board of Directors. Kelly has served as Southwest's Executive Vice President and CFO since 2001, and joined Southwest as its Controller in 1986, becoming Vice President Finance and CFO in 1989. Kelleher said: "Gary Kelly is one of our brightest stars, well respected throughout the industry and well known, over more than a decade, to the media, analyst, and investor communities for his excellence. As part of our Board's succession planning, we had already focused on Gary as Jim Parker's successor, and that process has simply been accelerated by Jim's personal decision to retire. Under Gary's leadership, Southwest has achieved the strongest balance sheet in the American airline industry; the best fuel hedging position in our industry; and tremendous progress in technology." Kelleher further announced that Laura Wright, currently Vice President Finance and Treasurer, would succeed Gary Kelly as Southwest's CFO. Laura joined Southwest in 1988 and since 1998 has been primarily responsible for Southwest's overall corporate finance strategy; its capital market and aircraft financing activities; new and used aircraft acquisitions; corporate tax and insurance programs; cash management and investing functions; and stock option programs. Kelleher stated: "Laura Wright is another shining star, who is also respected throughout our industry and well known to the analyst, investor, and vendor communities for her acumen and business judgment. We are indeed fortunate to have such an experienced and truly talented successor to Gary Kelly as our CFO." Kelleher closed by emphasizing that Gary Kelly and Laura Wright take on their additional responsibilities with many years of experience at Southwest and that each has been responsible for major project development, planning, and implementation; each has served on (or chaired) major committees throughout their respective tenures with the Company; each has had significant budget and People leadership responsibilities; each has made major contributions to the evolving philosophies and strategies of the Company; and each subscribes to the Company's Mission Statement as well as to its longheld Core Values. Kelleher stated, "Although I personally regret Jim Parker's decision to retire, I am also exceedingly pleased that Southwest has the demonstrated depth of management talent and leadership capability that will enable our Shareholders, Employees, and Customers to continue to be proud to be a part of the ongoing Southwest Airlines story of success through Legendary Customer Service." www.southwest.com Media Please Contact: Public Relations at 214/792-4847 Photos and bios are available at http://www.southwest.com
