CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS AND 32nd CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF PROFITABILITY DALLAS, TEXAS - January 19, 2005 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported its fourth quarter results. Net income for fourth quarter 2004 was $56 million, or $.07 per diluted share, compared to $66 million, or $.08 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2003. The Company also reported its 32nd consecutive year of profitability, with annual net income of $313 million, or $.38 per diluted share, compared to 2003 net income of $442 million, or $.54 per diluted share. Excluding last year's government grant, 2003 net income was $298 million, or $.36 per diluted share. Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: "I am very proud of our Employees and their strenuous efforts to lower our cost structure. Although our fourth quarter 2004 earnings declined 15.2 percent due to significantly higher energy costs, our unit costs, excluding fuel, declined 4.5 percent. As a result of our low cost competitive advantage and ongoing efforts to improve productivity, we have been able to offer the low fares our Customers demand while sustaining our profitability and growing our route system during these difficult airline industry times. Based on current cost trends, we expect our first quarter 2005 unit costs, excluding fuel, to decline from first quarter 2004's unit costs, excluding fuel, of 6.57 cents. "Even though jet fuel prices per gallon increased 20.1 percent, net of hedging gains, our overall unit costs declined 1.3 percent in fourth quarter 2004. We also continue to mitigate record-high jet fuel prices with our hedging program, which resulted in a reduction in fuel and oil expense of $174 million during fourth quarter 2004. Although we are 85 percent hedged in first quarter 2005 with prices capped at $26 per barrel, based on current market conditions, we presently expect first quarter 2005 average jet fuel cost per gallon to exceed fourth quarter 2004's 89.1 cents. We are 85 percent hedged for the remainder of 2005 with prices capped at $26 per barrel; 65 percent in 2006 at $32 per barrel; over 45 percent in 2007 at $31 per barrel; 30 percent in 2008 at $33 per barrel; and over 25 percent in 2009 at $35 per barrel. "The industry revenue environment continues to be a challenge due to the glut of airline seats. On balance, our fourth quarter revenue challenges are continuing into 2005. March 2005 results should benefit, however, from the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in April last year. "In December, we completed a significant transaction with ATA Airlines, Inc. Of primary importance to Southwest were the six Chicago Midway gates we acquired and a six-bay aircraft maintenance hangar in Chicago, which will close this month. In addition to the $40 million purchase price for these assets, we agreed to the following in order to win the competitive bid in bankruptcy court: a commitment to codeshare with ATA at Chicago Midway and other points on our route system, subject to facility availability and Customer convenience; a $40 million debtor-in-possession loan to ATA for bankruptcy restructuring purposes; and a commitment to convert the debtor-in- possession financing to a term loan and purchase $30 million in non-voting senior convertible preferred stock upon ATA's emergence from bankruptcy. The /more
codeshare to exchange passengers at Midway should begin to enhance our revenues as early as February 2005. "Barring any unforeseen events and assuming revenue trends somewhat improve throughout the quarter, as described above, we expect to be profitable again in first quarter 2005. "While we are not immune to the challenging industry revenue environment, our low costs and energetic People have allowed Southwest to react quickly to market opportunities. We look forward to bringing our low fares to Pittsburgh beginning May 2005 and the opportunity to soon increase service to Chicago Midway with the six additional gates recently acquired from ATA. "We continue to be well positioned for growth and currently plan to add 29 net aircraft in 2005. During fourth quarter 2004, we exercised three Boeing 737-700 options for 2006 delivery, bringing our 2006 firm orders and options to 26 and 8, respectively. "Despite industry challenges, our wonderful Employees consistently deliver their well-known friendly, warm, and caring Customer Service. As a result of their unwavering commitment to high-quality, low-fare service, Southwest was recently named 'Best Low Cost Carrier' by Business Traveler magazine." Southwest will discuss results on a conference call at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at southwest.com. Operating Results Total operating revenues for fourth quarter 2004 increased 9.1 percent to $1.66 billion, compared to $1.52 billion for fourth quarter 2003.

Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 12.6 percent in fourth quarter 2004, as compared to a 10.5 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a 1.2 point increase in load factor to 65.0 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM decreased 3.9 percent to 12.08 cents from 12.57 cents in fourth quarter 2003. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) decreased 1.3 percent to 8.18 cents from 8.29 cents in fourth quarter 2003.

"Other expenses" increased to $31 million in fourth quarter 2004 from $10 million in fourth quarter 2003 primarily due to a $15 million ($.01 per diluted share after profitsharing and income taxes) charge in "Other losses," which was recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." Interest expense also increased 30 percent in fourth quarter 2004 primarily due to higher interest rates and $350 million in senior unsecured Notes issued in September 2004. Net cash provided by operations for 2004 was $1.16 billion and cash expenditures for investing activities was $1.85 billion, which included a $34 million initial payment related to the assets acquired from ATA.

possession financing to ATA for bankruptcy restructuring purposes. During fourth quarter 2004, the Company issued $112 million of debt secured by four aircraft. We ended the year with $1.31 billion in cash plus our available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. During first quarter 2005, the Company will redeem $100 million of senior unsecured Notes due March 2005. Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 10.0 percent to $6.53 billion while operating expenses increased 9.6 percent to $5.98 billion, resulting in operating income of $554 million. Excluding the 2003 special item, operating expenses increased 10.4 percent. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $41 million (or $22 million net of profitsharing and income tax effects) for costs associated with the consolidation of the Company's reservation operations; the Company-wide early out offer; and the pay, per diem, and benefit increases retroactive to May 2002 related to the agreement reached with our Flight Attendants.

A reconciliation of key financial measures, excluding the 2003 special item, is included in this release, pursuant to Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There were no special items in 2004.

This special item, which was recorded in second quarter 2003, resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million to Employee profitsharing expense, included in "Salaries, wages, and benefits."

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.
