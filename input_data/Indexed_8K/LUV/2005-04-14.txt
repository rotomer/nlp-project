Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $76 MILLION; DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.09 DALLAS, TEXAS - April 14, 2005 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported first quarter 2005 net income of $76 million, or $.09 per diluted share, compared to $26 million for first quarter 2004, or $.03 per diluted share. These first quarter 2005 results compare favorably to the First Call mean estimate of $.05 per diluted share. Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: "Considering the many challenges our industry continues to face, we are grateful to report first quarter 2005 earnings of $76 million. Our rigorous focus on cost reduction and successful fuel hedging program shielded us from record high energy prices and enabled us to report our 56th consecutive quarter of profitability. For first quarter 2005, we were 86 percent hedged, which reduced fuel and oil expense by $155 million. In addition, we recorded $27 million in "other gains" in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 (SFAS 133), 'Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.' "We are 83 percent hedged for second quarter 2005 with crude oil prices capped at $26 per barrel. Based on current market conditions, we expect our jet fuel costs per gallon for second quarter 2005 to exceed first quarter 2005's 90.3 cents. We remain 85 percent hedged for second half 2005 at $26 per barrel; 65 percent in 2006 at $32 per barrel; over 45 percent in 2007 at $31 per barrel; 30 percent in 2008 at $33 per barrel; and over 25 percent in 2009 at $35 per barrel. "Excluding fuel, our unit costs declined 3.8 percent. This superb performance reflected a tremendous effort by our Employees, and they continue to work hard to improve productivity throughout our Company. Based on recent cost trends, we do not expect second quarter 2005 unit costs, excluding fuel, to significantly exceed first quarter 2005's excellent performance of 6.32 cents. "Our unit revenue improved 1.9 percent as we benefited from significant increases in freight and other revenues and a strong March passenger revenue performance. Following fourth quarter 2004 trends, we started the year with weak revenue yields. March, however, was positively impacted by the timing of the Easter holiday, which led to a record March load factor performance of 73.7 percent. March also benefited from our codeshare with ATA at Chicago Midway (initiated in February), competitive capacity reductions in certain markets, and modest fare increases. Although bookings are satisfactory for May and June, the Easter holiday timing is negatively impacting April traffic and load factors. At this juncture, it appears likely second quarter 2005 load factors will decline relative to last year's record levels, and it is, therefore, difficult to predict whether or not we will have favorable year - -over-year passenger unit revenue comparisons in second quarter 2005. "While we are not immune to the challenging industry revenue environment and glut of capacity, we are well positioned for growth and will continue to explore longterm profitable market opportunities. During first quarter 2005, we exercised seven Boeing 737-700 options for 2006 delivery, bringing our 2006 firm orders to 33, with one 2006 option remaining, for a planned annual available seat mile growth of approximately seven percent. /more
"We look forward to serving Pittsburgh, beginning May 4, 2005, with a total of ten daily nonstop departures to four cities: Philadelphia, Chicago Midway, Las Vegas, and Orlando. We are also excited about our Chicago Midway growth plans and will be at 192 Midway departures by July 5, 2005." Southwest will discuss its first quarter 2005 results on a conference call at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at www.southwest.com/jp/luvhome.shtml?src=IR_earn_041405. Operating Results Total operating revenues for first quarter 2005 increased 12.1 percent to $1.66 billion, compared to $1.48 billion for first quarter 2004. Operating income was $106 million compared to $46 million in first quarter 2004. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 12.3 percent in first quarter 2005, as compared to a 10.1 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a 1.2 point increase in load factor to 65.4 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM decreased 0.7 percent to 12.03 cents from 12.11 cents in first quarter 2004. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) increased 1.9 percent to 8.22 cents from 8.07 cents in first quarter 2004. Total first quarter 2005 operating expenses were $1.56 billion, an increase of 8.3 percent, compared to $1.44 billion in first quarter 2004. First quarter 2004 operating expenses included $18 million related to the consolidation of the Company's reservation centers. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for first quarter 2005 decreased 1.5 percent to 7.70 cents, compared to 7.82 cents in first quarter 2004. Excluding fuel, CASM for first quarter 2005 decreased 3.8 percent to 6.32 cents (compared to 6.57 cents for first quarter 2004), primarily due to lower unit labor, maintenance, and "other" operating expenses. "Other income" was $8 million for first quarter 2005 versus "other expense" of $5 million for first quarter 2004, primarily due to $27 million ($.02 per diluted share after profitsharing and income taxes) in "other gains" recorded in first quarter 2005 in accordance with SFAS 133. Interest expense increased 42.1 percent in first quarter 2005 primarily due to higher debt levels and higher floating interest rates. The first quarter 2005 effective income tax rate of 33.1 percent reflected a $6 million ($.01 per diluted share) reduction in income tax expense, attributable to the favorable resolution of an industry-wide issue regarding the tax treatment of certain aircraft engine maintenance costs. For first quarter 2005, net cash provided by operations was $886 million, which included a $490 million increase in fuel hedge related collateral deposits. Net cash used in investing activities was $172 million for first quarter 2005, which reflects $423 million in capital expenditures plus the remaining $6 million related to assets acquired from ATA Airlines, Inc. These cash expenditures were partially offset by a $257 million increase related to the reclassification of auction-rate securities held at December 31, 2004 to short-term investments. During first quarter 2005, the Company issued $300 million in senior unsecured Notes due 2017 and redeemed $100 million of senior unsecured Notes. The Company completed its previously announced $300 million common stock repurchase program during first quarter 2005. Approximately 3.9 million common shares were repurchased during the quarter, bringing the total shares repurchased during the program to 21 million. The Company ended first quarter 2005 with $1.9 billion cash on hand plus an available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. For the ninth consecutive year, Southwest Airlines was recognized by /more
