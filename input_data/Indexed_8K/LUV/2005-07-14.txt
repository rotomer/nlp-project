Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $159 MILLION; DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.20 DALLAS, TEXAS - July 14, 2005 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported second quarter 2005 net income of $159 million, or $.20 per diluted share, compared to $113 million for second quarter 2004, or $.14 per diluted share. These second quarter 2005 results compare favorably to the First Call mean estimate of $.18 per diluted share. Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: "We are proud to report our second quarter 2005 earnings of $159 million, which represented our 57th consecutive quarter of profitability and a significant increase in earnings versus last year. Considering soaring oil prices and the enormous operational challenges our Company and industry have faced over the past four years, our operating cost performance was exceptional and better than we expected. Even with a 25 percent rise in our jet fuel costs per gallon, second quarter 2005 unit costs decreased 3.5 percent. "Although we remain well-hedged, our Employees understand that we must be prepared for higher fuel costs, and they are working harder than ever to reduce our cost structure through increased productivity. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2005 unit costs, excluding fuel, to be in line with second quarter 2005 unit cost of 6.27 cents. Current jet fuel costs are higher than second quarter. "Despite the difficult year-over-year comparisons and the glut of airline capacity on the East Coast, our second quarter 2005 revenues grew 13.3 percent, with unit revenue only slightly below our second quarter 2004 performance of 9.14 cents. Demand for air travel continued to strengthen, which resulted in a 4.6 percent improvement in passenger revenue yield per revenue passenger mile. As a result of modest fare increases and an improved fare mix, unit revenue grew in the two to three percent range in May and June, and we continue to be encouraged by recent revenue trends. Based on bookings and traffic trends thus far in July, we expect a year-over-year increase in unit revenue in third quarter 2005, despite our planned third quarter capacity growth of twelve percent. "Due to the continued demand for Southwest's low fares and friendly Customer Service, we remain excited about our growth opportunities and currently estimate available seat mile capacity growth of eleven percent this year. During second quarter 2005, we exercised the remaining Boeing 737-700 option for 2006 delivery bringing our total 2006 firm orders to 34, for a planned 2006 capacity growth in the seven to eight percent range. "We initiated service to Pittsburgh on May 4th, with our Legendary low fares, and have been very pleased with the tremendous Customer response and demand for Southwest service. As a consequence, more flights are planned for Pittsburgh later this year. We are also looking forward to bringing our low fares to Ft. Myers in October 2005 and will be announcing our fares and schedules later today. Southwest continues to add service to Philadelphia, which will soon be at 50 daily departures. Chicago Midway also continues to serve as an excellent growth opportunity and is now our third largest airport in terms of daily departures. We recently expanded our codeshare agreement with ATA Airlines with new connecting service through Las Vegas. As a /more
result of our codeshare, Southwest expects to generate a total of $50 million in additional passenger revenue, annually." Southwest Airlines was recognized recently for its commitment to providing affordable fares and friendly, high quality service with the top ranking in Customer Service Satisfaction, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index conducted by the University of Michigan Business School's National Quality Research Center. Southwest will discuss its second quarter 2005 results on a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at www.southwest.com. Operating Results Total operating revenues for second quarter 2005 increased 13.3 percent to $1.94 billion, compared to $1.72 billion for second quarter 2004. Operating income was $277 million compared to $197 million in second quarter 2004. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 8.1 percent in second quarter 2005, as compared to a 13.7 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs), resulting in a 3.8 point decline in load factor to 72.5 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 4.6 percent to 12.07 cents from 11.54 cents in second quarter 2004. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) decreased slightly to 9.11 cents from 9.14 cents in second quarter 2004. Total second quarter 2005 operating expenses were $1.67 billion, an increase of 9.7 percent, compared to $1.52 billion in second quarter 2004. Second quarter 2004 operating expenses included $23 million (or $12 million net of profitsharing and income tax effects) for costs associated with the Company's early out offer and the agreement reached with the Flight Attendants. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for second quarter 2005 decreased 3.5 percent to 7.81 cents, compared to 8.09 cents in second quarter 2004. The Company's hedging program resulted in a reduction to fuel and oil expense of $196 million in second quarter 2005. The Company remains approximately 85 percent hedged for the second half of 2005 at $26 per barrel; approximately 65 percent in 2006 at $32 per barrel; over 45 percent in 2007 at $31 per barrel; 30 percent in 2008 at $33 per barrel; and over 25 percent in 2009 at $35 per barrel. Excluding fuel, CASM for second quarter 2005 decreased 7.7 percent to 6.27 cents. The Company experienced unit cost declines in almost every non-fuel cost category. Net interest expense of $10 million for second quarter 2005 increased from second quarter 2004 due to higher debt levels. Other losses of $11 million in both second quarter 2005 and 2004 primarily consisted of net expenses recorded in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net cash provided by operations was $1.55 billion, which included a $650 million increase in fuel hedge related collateral deposits, and capital expenditures were $719 million. The Company ended second quarter 2005 with $2.3 billion cash on hand plus a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $575 million. Total operating revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2005 increased 12.8 percent to $3.61 billion while total operating expenses increased 9.1 percent to $3.23 billion, resulting in operating income in first half 2005 of $383 million versus $243 million in first half 2004.
