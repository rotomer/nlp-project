Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2005 EARNINGS; EXCEEDS FIRST CALL MEAN ESTIMATE DALLAS, TEXAS - October 20, 2005 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported third quarter 2005 net income of $227 million, or $.28 per diluted share, compared to $119 million for third quarter 2004, or $.15 per diluted share. The Company's third quarter 2005 results included $87 million (before income taxes) in unrealized gains, included in "Other gains", associated with derivative instruments that will settle in future accounting periods, recorded as a result of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Excluding these unrealized gains, third quarter 2005 net income was $174 million, or $.21 per diluted share. These third quarter 2005 results compare favorably to the First Call mean estimate of $.18 per diluted share. Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: "We are very pleased with our third quarter 2005 earnings performance. Excluding unrealized SFAS 133 gains, our third quarter 2005 earnings were up 46.2 percent to $174 million. This quarter was affected by two enormously destructive hurricanes, Katrina and Rita. The response by our Employees in the face of these crises was nothing short of remarkable. Their heroic efforts make these results very special, and I am very grateful to all our Employees for a tremendous performance. "The third quarter 2005 earnings growth was driven by record passenger revenues and load factors. We also benefited from strong performances in freight, charters, and business partner commissions. Operating revenues increased 18.8 percent versus a year ago, or 5.9 percent per available seat mile (ASM). The industry demand environment has improved, and the strong demand for our industry-leading low fares and high quality Customer Service resulted in a record third quarter load factor performance of 74.9 percent, at improved yields. We were able to drive robust revenue growth with only modest fare increases securing our Low Fare Brand leadership. We also benefited from a reduction in the glut of competitive seat capacity. We were very pleased with ATA codeshare third quarter 2005 results, which generated $19 million in revenues. ATA continues to reorganize in Chapter 11, and is seeking exit financing. As part of its reorganization efforts, ATA recently announced it will be discontinuing service in Chicago Midway to Minneapolis, Newark, and Boston in fourth quarter 2005. While our codeshare activity will decline, as a consequence, we will pursue opportunities to continue Southwest's growth at Midway. We have been pleased with our expansion efforts at Midway this year. "With respect to fourth quarter 2005, we are enjoying favorable load factor trends in October, and Customer bookings for the remainder of fourth quarter 2005 are good. We are hopeful year over year unit revenue trends will continue to improve as they did throughout third quarter 2005. "We continue to mitigate record-high jet fuel prices with our successful hedging program, which resulted in a $295 million benefit from settled contracts in third quarter 2005. We are also approximately 85 percent hedged in fourth quarter 2005 with average crude prices capped in the $26 per barrel range and have hedged the refinery margins on the majority of those positions. However, given the unprecedented surge in Gulf Coast jet fuel prices following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we expect fourth quarter 2005
jet fuel costs per gallon to be well above the third quarter 2005 jet fuel cost per gallon of 95 cents. Unless Gulf Coast jet fuel prices recede from current levels, our fourth quarter 2005 jet fuel cost per gallon could exceed $1.25. We are more than 70 percent hedged for 2006 with average crude prices capped in the $36 per barrel range and also have hedged the refinery margins on the majority of our 2006 positions. We are over 55 percent hedged in 2007 at approximately $37 per barrel; about 35 percent in 2008 at approximately $37 per barrel; and about 30 percent in 2009 at approximately $39 per barrel. In short, we are well-prepared for rising energy costs. Our People are taking aggressive actions to prepare for rising energy costs and sustain our profitability and financial health. "Excluding fuel, our third quarter 2005 unit costs were down, again, compared with the year ago performance. We revised our fourth quarter 2005 flight schedule for the significant reduction in our New Orleans service following Hurricane Katrina. Our fourth quarter 2005 flight schedule was also affected by the recent Boeing strike, which delayed scheduled new aircraft deliveries. As a result, our year-over-year capacity growth for fourth quarter 2005 will be approximately seven percent, less than previously planned. We expect our fourth quarter 2005 unit costs, excluding fuel, to modestly exceed third quarter's 6.31 cents. "Our hearts go out to all those affected by the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. We resumed service from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (MSY) on September 20th after it had been shut down for approximately three weeks. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, we were the largest air carrier with 57 daily departures. We currently operate four daily roundtrips to Houston Hobby Airport, with strong traffic and encouraging bookings. As a part of the New Orleans community, we are anxious to do our part to rebuild the city, and we will continue to add more flights based on demand. We are very proud of our Employees' efforts to serve our Customers in this stressful time. Finally, I am also very proud of how Southwest and our Employees took care of our Gulf Coast Employees in this time of need. "We are very pleased with the performance of our new Pittsburgh markets and our new Ft. Myers service, which began this month. Given the improving airline industry outlook, we are excited about our 2006 growth opportunities and, currently, we expect 33 Boeing 737-700 deliveries in 2006, which will result in an estimated 2006 ASM capacity growth of approximately eight percent. With the resumption of deliveries from Boeing, and the availability of aircraft created from Katrina-related schedule changes, we are accelerating the start-up of our previously planned new city next year to early 2006. I am very excited to announce that, after a 20-year absence, Southwest will return to Denver, Colorado. As a result of its efforts to dramatically reduce its costs over the years, Denver International Airport has emerged as an excellent opportunity for Southwest Airlines. Even better, our Customers, along with new Denver Customers, will benefit from lower fares and Positively Outrageous Customer Service, Southwest style. We will announce our start dates, schedule, and fares next week." Southwest will discuss its third quarter 2005 results on a conference call at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at southwest.com. Operating Results Total operating revenues for third quarter 2005 increased 18.8 percent to $1.99 billion, compared to $1.67 billion for third quarter 2004. Operating income was $273 million compared to $191 million in third quarter 2004. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 15.5 percent in third quarter 2005, as compared to a 12.1 percent increase in available seat miles (ASMs),
resulting in a 2.2 point increase in load factor to 74.9 percent. The passenger revenue yield per RPM increased 2.6 percent to 11.68 cents from 11.38 cents in third quarter 2004. Operating revenue yield per ASM (RASM) increased 5.9 percent to 9.10 cents from 8.59 cents in third quarter 2004. Total third quarter 2005 operating expenses were $1.72 billion, an increase of 15.7 percent, compared to $1.48 billion in third quarter 2004. Operating expenses per ASM (CASM) for third quarter 2005 increased 3.2 percent to 7.85 cents, compared to 7.61 cents in third quarter 2004. The Company's hedging program produced realized gains in third quarter 2005 of $295 million. Gains of $276 million were recorded as a reduction in fuel and oil expense in third quarter 2005. The remainder of the realized gains were recorded in "Other gains," as described below. Excluding fuel, CASM for third quarter 2005 decreased slightly to 6.31 cents. In addition to the $87 million of SFAS 133 unrealized gains recorded in third quarter 2005, "Other expenses (income)" included $17 million in "other gains," which consisted primarily of SFAS 133 realized gains related to settled contracts, as defined, on current period hedges, partially offset by approximately $9 million of net interest expense. "Other expenses (income)" for third quarter 2004 included $4 million in "Other losses" and $6 million in net interest expense. The third quarter 2005 income tax rate was 38.3 percent versus 34.1 percent for third quarter 2004. The prior year rate was favorably impacted by an adjustment related to the ultimate resolution of an airline industry-wide issue regarding the tax treatment of certain aircraft engine maintenance costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net cash provided by operations was $2.2 billion, which included a $865 million increase in fuel hedge-related collateral deposits, and capital expenditures were $993 million. The Company ended third quarter 2005 with $2.4 billion cash on hand plus $185 million of auction-rate securities, classified as "Short-term investments". In addition, the Company had a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $600 million. Total operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased 14.8 percent to $5.60 billion while total operating expenses increased 11.3 percent to $4.94 billion, resulting in operating income of $656 million, compared to $435 million for the nine-month period in 2004. Net income for the nine-month period in 2005 was $462 million, or $.57 per diluted share, versus $258 million, or $.32 per diluted share, in 2004. Excluding the impact of the unrealized SFAS 133 gains recorded in third quarter 2005, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $409 million, or $.50 per diluted share.

NOTE: The above schedule reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. The special items are unrealized gains or losses (before income taxes) for derivative instruments that will settle in future accounting periods, recorded as a result of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended. These unrealized amounts relate to both ineffectiveness, as defined, for these future period instruments and the change in market value for future period deriviatives that no longer qualified for special hedge accounting, as defined in SFAS 133. In management's view, comparative analysis of results can be enhanced by excluding the impact of these items. The unrealized amounts are not indicative of the Company's operating performance for the applicable period, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. In addition, since fuel expense is such a large part of the Company's operating costs and is subject to extreme volatility, the Company believes it is useful to provide investors with the Company's true economic cost of fuel for the periods presented, based on cash settlements from hedging activities, but excluding the unrealized impact of hedges that will settle in future periods. /more
