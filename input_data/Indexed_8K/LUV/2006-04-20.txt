EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Relations (214) 792-4415 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS REVENUES EXCEED $2.0 BILLION DALLAS, TEXAS -- April 20, 2006 -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported first quarter 2006 net income of $61 million, or $.07 per diluted share, compared to $59 million for first quarter 2005, or $.07 per diluted share, as adjusted (see below). The Company's first quarter 2006 and 2005 net income includes unrealized gains/losses associated with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Excluding these unrealized SFAS 133 gains/losses (see Supplemental Schedule II), net income for first quarter 2006 increased 49 percent to $64 million, or $.08 per diluted share, compared to $43 million, or $.05 per diluted share for first quarter 2005, as adjusted. These results exceeded First Call's mean estimate of $.07 per diluted share for first quarter 2006. Prior year results have been adjusted to retroactively apply the adoption of SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment", which requires all stock-based compensation to be expensed and accounted for using a fair value based method. The adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $22 million (before income taxes and profitsharing), or $.01 per diluted share, and $20 million (before income taxes), or $.02 per diluted share, in first quarters 2006 and 2005, respectively. Results for 2005 also have been adjusted for the Company's election to change its method of accounting for airframe maintenance of Boeing 737-300 and - -500 aircraft from the deferral method to the direct expense method. As required by SFAS 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections", the Company has adjusted prior periods to show financial statements as if the direct expense method had been used in all prior years. This adjustment resulted in additional pretax maintenance expense of $5 million for first quarter 2005, which did not result in a material impact to diluted earnings per share. The Company has provided a reconciliation (see Supplemental Schedule I) of previously reported results for 2005 to results adjusted for the Company's two accounting changes, which were both effective January 1, 2006. /more
Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: "We are pleased with the continued and consistent improvement in our earnings performance. Excluding SFAS 133 items, our first quarter 2006 earnings of $64 million were up 49 percent over last year's adjusted earnings of $43 million. Despite soaring energy costs, this represented another quarter of strong earnings growth and a stellar performance by the People of Southwest Airlines. "Even though Easter was in April this year (versus March last year), our revenues increased 21.4 percent, or 11.3 percent per available seat mile. Demand for our low fares and high quality Customer Service was strong, resulting in a record first quarter load factor of 69.2 percent, up 3.8 points from first quarter 2005. Thus far, strong load factor and revenue trends have continued in April, and Customer bookings for the remainder of second quarter 2006 are strong. "We continued to maintain Low Fare Leadership in America, increasing yields simply to offset ever-higher jet fuel prices. Passenger revenue yields per mile increased 5.4 percent in first quarter 2006 versus the year ago period. "As expected, our unit costs increased 10.4 percent in first quarter 2006 due to higher jet fuel costs. Despite a $133 million benefit from our fuel hedging position, our first quarter 2006 jet fuel costs per gallon increased 62.8 percent to $1.46 per gallon. For second quarter 2006, we are over 75 percent hedged with prices capped at $36 per barrel. Based on this hedging position and current market conditions, we expect our second quarter 2006 fuel cost per gallon to be in the $1.45 to $1.50 range. We are over 70 percent hedged for the remainder of 2006 at $36 per barrel; over 60 percent in 2007 at $39 per barrel; over 35 percent in 2008 at $38 per barrel; and about 30 percent in 2009 at $39 per barrel. "Excluding fuel, our unit cost performance was in line with our expectations at 6.43 cents and down slightly from the adjusted year ago performance. Once again, the People of Southwest Airlines delivered more, making an efficient airline even more efficient. Although we expect second quarter 2006 unit costs, excluding fuel, to increase from first quarter 2006's 6.43 cents, we are pleased with our cost control efforts. And, thanks to our Employees, we are optimistic we can achieve our full-year 2006 goal of flat year-over-year unit costs, excluding fuel, at 6.48 cents. "We recently announced our request for two gates at Washington Dulles International Airport and intention to start service this fall. As our 63rd airport, Dulles represents an exciting opportunity to complement our existing service to the Washington D.C. metro area from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, our fourth largest operation. We are very pleased with the strong Customer response to our /more 2
new Denver service, which we commenced on January 3, 2006 and currently offer 20 daily nonstop departures to five cities. We also continue to grow our existing route system, with upcoming service additions to Nashville, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. "Chicago Midway also continues to provide expansion opportunities. In fourth quarter 2005, ATA Airlines, Inc. entered into an agreement in which an investor would provide financing to enable ATA to emerge from bankruptcy. As part of this transaction, in December 2005, we acquired the leasehold rights to four additional gates at Chicago Midway Airport in exchange for a $20 million reduction in our debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan to ATA. Upon ATA's emergence from bankruptcy on February 28, 2006, ATA repaid Southwest in cash the remaining $20 million balance of the DIP loan. In addition, we were relieved of our commitment to purchase $30 million of ATA convertible preferred stock. As part of this agreement, we expanded our codeshare with ATA and will be enhancing our Rapid Rewards program to provide new award destinations via ATA. "We are confident about our future growth opportunities as evidenced by our agreement with Boeing today to exercise 79 options for delivery of Boeing 737-700 aircraft in 2007 through 2012, bringing our current firm orders to 140. We also have 116 options, with delivery positions in 2008 through 2012, and 54 purchase rights for delivery through December 31, 2014." (See Supplemental Schedule IV.) For the tenth year in a row, Fortune magazine recognized Southwest Airlines in its annual survey of corporate reputations. Among all industries in 2006, Fortune listed Southwest Airlines as number three among America's Top Ten Most Admired Corporations. The Company was also recently recognized for the seventh consecutive year by Business Ethics magazine as one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens that excel at serving a variety of stakeholders. Institutional Investor magazine named Southwest Airlines as America's Most Shareholder-Friendly Airline in its survey of investors and analysts. Finally, Southwest Airlines Cargo was recently named "Airline of the Year" by the Express Delivery & Logistics Association, for the second year in a row, marking the sixth consecutive year that the Company has been honored for its excellence in air cargo delivery service. Southwest will discuss its first quarter 2006 results on a conference call at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available at SOUTHWEST.COM. /more 3

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE I RECONCILIATION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO ADJUSTED AMOUNTS AND TO NON-GAAP ITEMS (SEE NOTE) (in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) (1) The adjustments to prior years from the adoption of SFAS 123R differ from the amounts disclosed in previous years' financial statements due to the treatment of the assumed impact of profitsharing expense. In prior periods, the Company's disclosures have reflected share-based compensation expense net of applicable profitsharing expense, due to the fact that if share-based compensation expense had been recorded, Company profitsharing contributions would have been reduced. However, although the Company has elected to adjust prior period financial statements, the Company's Profitsharing Plan precludes the Company from changing prior years' profitsharing contributions made or accrued. The profitsharing amount related to 2005 was $12 million, or $3 million per quarter. On a per share basis for 2005, the $12 million resulted in a difference of $.02, both basic and diluted. (2) Tax impact related to the SFAS 123R accounting change was $6 million in the first three quarters of 2005 and $7 million in fourth quarter 2005. The remaining tax impact related to the maintenance accounting change. /more 10
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE II RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED AMOUNTS TO NON-GAAP ITEMS (SEE NOTE) (in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) Note regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures The non-GAAP items referred to in this news release are provided as supplemental information, and should not be relied upon as alternative measures to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include items calculated by the Company on an "economic" basis, which excludes certain unrealized items that are recorded as a result of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended. The unrealized items consist of gains or losses for derivative instruments that will settle in future accounting periods or gains or losses that have been recognized in prior period results, but which have settled in the current period. This includes ineffectiveness, as defined, for future period instruments and the change in market value for future period derivatives that no longer qualified for special hedge accounting, as defined in SFAS 133. The Company's management utilizes both the GAAP and the non-GAAP results in this news release to evaluate the Company's performance and believes that comparative analysis of results can be enhanced by excluding the impact of the unrealized items. Management believes in certain cases, the Company's GAAP results are not indicative of the Company's operating performance for the applicable period, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. In addition, since fuel expense is such a large part of the Company's operating costs and is subject to extreme volatility, the Company believes it is useful to provide investors with the Company's true economic cost of fuel for the periods presented, based on cash settlements from hedging activities, but excluding the unrealized impact of hedges that will settle in future periods or were recognized in prior periods. /more 11
