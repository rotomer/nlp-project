If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify you and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.

(h)
 
The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with you, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as may be required for the distribution of the Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or to subject itself to taxation as doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise required to be so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as provided above.
 
 
 
(i)
 
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall not, without your prior written consent, offer, sell, or enter into any agreement to sell (as public debt securities registered under the 1933 Act (other than the Securities) or as debt securities which may be resold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act in reliance on Rule 144A thereunder and which are marketed through the use of a disclosure document containing substantially the same information as a prospectus for similar debt securities registered under the 1933 Act), any debt securities similar to the Securities, equipment notes, pass through certificates, equipment trust certificates or equipment purchase certificates secured by aircraft owned or leased by the Company (or rights relating thereto).
 
(j) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the Final Term Sheet; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus. The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus as an issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Issuer General Use Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

Indemnification and Contribution; Default of Underwriters
.
 
(a)
 
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter,
its affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the 1933 Act), its selling agent
and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereof) or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Base Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act Regulations or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
, except in each case insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in any such document (Underwriter Information).
 
(b)
 
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of the officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter but only with reference to the Underwriter Information provided by such Underwriter.
 
15
(c)
 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the indemnified party) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the indemnifying party) in writing. The indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall, and the indemnifying party may elect to, retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to retain counsel as required by the prior sentence to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable amount of time. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The firm chosen to represent the indemnified parties shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 90 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless such fees and expenses are being disputed in good faith. The indemnifying party at any time may, subject to the last sentence of this Section 8(c), settle or compromise any proceeding described in this paragraph at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
 
16
(d)
 
To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is required to be made but is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then the applicable indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of such Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of such Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the proceeds from the offering of such Securities received by the Company (before deducting expenses) less total underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the Underwriters by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the Underwriters by the Company, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of such Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or information supplied by the Underwriters, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by
pro
 
rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
9.
Default by an Underwriter
. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities, you may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occurs exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 7 and 8 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
17
10.
Termination
. This Agreement shall be subject to termination, in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time if
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities shall have occurred in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any substantial national or international calamity or emergency shall occur and the effect of which is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus or (v) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such) as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
In the event of any such termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Section 8 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11 through 15 hereof shall remain in effect.
 
11.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 7 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the occurrence of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or 10, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of such Securities and comply with its other obligations under Section 7.

As the Representatives of the several Underwriters
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Vice President - General Counsel of Southwest Airlines Co., a Texas corporation (Southwest). In such capacity, I and persons on my legal staff have acted as counsel to Southwest in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement dated December 11, 2006 among Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and the other Underwriters party thereto (collectively, the Underwriters) and Southwest (the Underwriting Agreement). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion is furnished pursuant to Section 6(b)(1) of the Underwriting Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I or members of my legal staff have reviewed the following documents, each of which is dated as of the date hereof, except where otherwise indicated above or below:
(a)
 
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement,
A-1
The Indenture, the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement are referred to herein collectively as the Transaction Documents.
In addition, I or members of my legal staff have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to my or their satisfaction of all such corporate records of Southwest and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of Southwest and such other persons, and I or members of my legal staff have made such investigations of law, as I deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I and members of my legal staff have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, I and members of my legal staff have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I or they have reviewed including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Southwest in the Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, the phrase to my knowledge shall mean to my actual knowledge after reasonable investigation, including inquiry of members of my legal staff, but shall not be interpreted to impute to me knowledge of others.
A-2
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.
 
Southwest has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas, with corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; Southwest is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in the United States in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the business or consolidated financial condition of Southwest.
2.
 
To my knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any governmental agency or body or court, domestic or foreign, now pending against Southwest or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that (i) is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and is not so disclosed or (ii) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of Southwest to perform its obligations under any of the Transaction Documents.
3.

The Indenture is qualified under the 1939 Act.
8.
 
The issuance and sale of the Notes to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the valid authorization, execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by Southwest and the performance by Southwest of its obligations under the Transaction Documents do not require Southwest to obtain or effect any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental agency or body of the United States or the State of Texas, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or blue sky laws.

To my knowledge, except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there is no event of default under any material agreement or instrument under which indebtedness of Southwest is outstanding or by which it is bound or any of its properties is subject.

The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and, to my knowledge, (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and (ii) no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
 
11.
 
Without independent check or verification of the statements contained therein, the Registration Statement and the Base Prospectus (other than the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I am not expressing an opinion), in each case excluding the documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates, appear on their face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act.

Each document filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations there under (the Exchange Act), and incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (other than the exhibits thereto, the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein, or incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference, or omitted therefrom, as to which I am not expressing an opinion), when so filed with the Commission, appeared on its face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act.

I have examined the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and in the role of General Counsel are such, however, that I cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made therein have made no independent check or verification thereof. In the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, I have participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of Southwest and with representatives of the Underwriters. My examination of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and my participation in the above-mentioned conferences did not disclose to me any information which has led me to believe that (i) the Registration Statement (other than the exhibits thereto, the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein, or incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom) and each amendment thereto, at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein, or incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom), as of its date contained, or as of the date hereof contains, any untrue statement of a material fact or, as of its date omitted, or as of the date hereof omits, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or
(iii)
the General Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein, or incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of Southwest, they are based solely on a certificate of existence and of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to qualification to do business of Southwest and the Subsidiaries, they are based solely on certificates of foreign qualification received from the applicable Secretary of States office.
The opinions in the last sentence of paragraph 5 above are subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally, (ii) general principles of equity including, without limitation, laches and estoppel as equitable defenses and concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforceability is considered or applied in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) the qualification that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America and the law of the State of Texas, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, except that I express no opinion with respect to (i) the laws, regulations or ordinances of any county, town or municipality or governmental subdivision or agency thereof, (ii) (x) state securities or blue sky laws and (y) except as set forth in paragraphs 7, 10, 11 and 12 above, federal securities laws, including without limitation the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (iii) any federal or state tax, antitrust or fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, and (iv) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. In addition, my opinions are based upon a review of those laws, statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
A-5
The opinions set forth above may be relied upon by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee under the Indenture, as fully as if this opinion letter had been addressed to it. Otherwise, such opinions are solely for the benefit of you and your counsel and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other persons without my written permission.
