DALLAS, TEXAS - January 17, 2007 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2006 results. Net income for fourth quarter 2006 was $57 million, or $.07 per diluted share, compared to $70 million, or $.09 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2005, including special items for both years. Excluding these
special items, fourth quarter 2006 net income was $96 million, or $.12 per diluted share, compared to $81 million, or $.10 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2005. These results are in line with First Calls mean estimate of $.12 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2006. For the full year 2006, net income was $499 million, or $.61 per diluted share, compared to $484 million, or $.60 per diluted share, for 2005. Excluding special items, 2006 net income was $587 million, or $.71 per diluted share, compared to $425 million, or $.53 per diluted share for 2005. (Refer to the reconciliation in the accompanying tables for further information regarding special items.)
Fourth Quarter 2006 Financial Highlights:
Full Year 2006 Financial Highlights:
Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: We are delighted with our 2006 earnings performance, which represented our 34
th
consecutive year of profitability. Our earnings, excluding special items, increased 38 percent from 2005, far exceeding our goal. With almost 50 percent higher jet fuel costs per gallon, and the security related challenges we faced during the latter part of the year, our Employees had to put forth a tremendous effort to achieve these outstanding results. And, they did. As a result of our People's hard work, innovation, and Warrior Spirit, we continued to improve our efficiency and solidify our position as the Low Cost Leader. As a great place to work with the best Employees, and the Low Cost/Low Fare Leader for the last 35 years, Southwest has democratized the skies with low fares and high quality service to our Customers. As a result of this unwavering commitment, Southwest Airlines now carries the most passengers of any U.S. airline, according to the most recently published monthly figures released by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. At the same time, our Employees are more productive than they have been in three decades. These are remarkable accomplishments, and I am extremely proud of our Employees and also grateful to our 84 million Customers served in 2006.

 We are very pleased with our solid fourth quarter 2006 earnings performance. Even though our hedged jet fuel cost per gallon increased almost 30 percent, fourth quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, grew 20 percent to $.12.  Despite growing capacity 10 percent, and the lingering effects of the August London terrorist threat and related carryon restrictions, we achieved a record fourth quarter 2006 load factor of 70.2 percent at healthy yields, which resulted in a steady unit revenue growth rate of 4.2 percent. Based upon our traffic and bookings to date, we expect 2007 first quarter year-over-year unit revenue growth to remain steady. 
Our fourth quarter 2006 unit costs (economic) increased 3.0 percent due to higher jet fuel prices. Even with a superb fuel hedging position and $118 million in fourth quarter 2006 cash hedging gains, our jet fuel costs per gallon (economic) increased 28 percent from a year ago to $1.56, as expected
. We are benefiting from the recent decline in energy prices and are now 100 percent hedged (economic) for first quarter 2007, capped at an average crude-equivalent price of approximately $50 per barrel (compared to
over 75 percent hedged at approximately $36 per barrel for first quarter 2006)
.
"Based on this hedge position and today's market prices, we are forecasting our first quarter 2007 jet fuel costs per gallon (economic) to be in the $1.65 to $1.70 range. We are nearly 95 percent hedged (economic) for the remainder of 2007 at approximately $50 per barrel; 65 percent in 2008 at approximately $49 per barrel; over 50 percent in 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel; over 25 percent in 2010 at $63 per barrel; approximately 15 percent in 2011 at $64 per barrel, and 15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel.
Excluding fuel, our fourth quarter 2006 unit costs were down 3.3 percent compared with a year ago, which is another excellent performance. Based on current cost trends, we expect our first quarter 2007 unit costs, excluding fuel, to increase from fourth quarter 2006s stellar performance of 6.46 cents. For the full year 2006, our unit costs, excluding fuel, were flat with 2005, right in line with our goals.
"We are pleased with
the Customer response to our new service to Washington Dulles International Airport, which was introduced at the beginning of fourth quarter 2006. We are also elated with the strong Customer demand for our new low fare service that we added to and from Dallas Love Field following the implementation of the Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006, which increased fourth quarter 2006 revenues by approximately $11 million.

"
We are very excited about 2007 and are well-positioned to respond to airline industry changes and consolidation. We have significant growth opportunities with or without consolidation and currently plan to add 37 aircraft in 2007 for an estimated eight percent available seat mile increase. These deliveries will bring our fleet to 518 Boeing 737s by the end of 2007. We also recently exercised one Boeing 737-700 option for delivery in 2008, bringing our 2008 firm orders and options to 30 and 4, respectively.
"Based on our financial strength, competitive position, the current economic environment, and the recent decline in jet fuel prices, our current 2007 outlook is favorable and, barring any unforeseen events, we are hopeful that we can exceed our 15 percent growth target for earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, just as we did in 2006.
"As our People demonstrated in 2006, they are the best, and they are the reason we overcame tremendous challenges and achieved excellent results. Among all airlines in the world, Southwest was named the Best Low-Cost Carrier in the 2006 Executive Travel Leading Edge Awards. For the 10
th
year in a row, Southwest Airlines was also named among the top ten Most Admired Companies in America by Fortune Magazine. These are but two of the many awards and recognitions that our People earned for Southwest, and I am very proud of them and very grateful to them.
Southwest will discuss its fourth quarter 2006 results on a conference call at
11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available

Total fourth quarter 2006 operating expenses were $2.10 billion, compared to $1.85 billion in fourth quarter 2005. Including special items, operating income for fourth quarter 2006 was $174 million, an increase of 24.3 percent, compared to $140 million in fourth quarter 2005.

Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 19.8 percent to $9.1 billion from 2005, while operating expenses increased 18.9 percent to $8.15 billion, resulting in operating income of $934 million, an increase of $209 million or 28.8 percent. Excluding special items, operating income was $975 million, an increase of $236 million or 31.9 percent.
 
Including the cash benefit of $675 million and $906 million from fuel hedging gains, in 2006 and 2005, respectively, 2006 jet fuel costs per gallon (economic) increased 47.1 percent to $1.50 from the same period in 2005.
 
  
"Other expenses" was $144 million for 2006 versus "other income" of $54 million for 2005. The $198 million swing in total other expenses (income) primarily resulted from $151 million in other losses recognized in 2006 versus $90 million in other gains recognized in 2005. In both periods, these other (gains) losses primarily resulted from unrealized gains/losses associated with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended
. The cost of the hedging program (which includes the premium costs of derivative contracts) of $52 million in 2006 and $35 million in 2005 is also included in "other (gains) losses."
The fourth quarter 2006 income tax rate of 43.5 percent reflects a $4 million increase to income tax expense, which related to the State of Texas Franchise Tax law enacted in 2006. For the full year, income tax expense decreased by $9 million due to this state law change.  The Company currently expects an effective tax rate of approximately 38 percent in 2007.
                Net cash provided by operations for 2006 was $1.41 billion, which included a $410 million decrease in fuel derivative collateral deposits related to future periods. For the full year 2006, capital expenditures were $1.40 billion, and the Company also repurchased $800 million of its common stock. During fourth quarter 2006, the Company issued $300 million in senior unsecured Notes due 2016 and will redeem $122 million of its debt maturing in 2007.
 
The Company ended 2006 with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, which includes $540 million in fuel derivative collateral deposits. In addition, the Company also had a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $600 million.
