DALLAS, TEXAS -
April 19, 2007 - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported its first quarter 2007 results. Net income for first quarter 2007 was $93 million, or $.12 per diluted share, compared to $61 million, or $.07 per diluted share, for first quarter 2006. Economic net income for first quarter 2007 was $33 million, or $.04 per diluted share, compared to $64 million, or $.08 per diluted share, for first quarter 2006. This economic net income result is in line with First Calls mean estimate of $.04 per diluted share for first quarter 2007. (Refer to the reconciliation in the accompanying tables for further information regarding economic results.)
First Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights:
 
                Gary C. Kelly, CEO, stated: Although we are gratified to report our 64
th
consecutive quarter of profitability, it is disappointing to report first quarter economic earnings below year-ago levels. Led by higher fuel costs, our year-over-year first quarter 2007 economic operating costs increased 4.3 percent per available seat mile, as expected. Based on the strength of last years overall revenue growth, we had hoped this years revenue growth would surmount these cost pressures. First quarter 2007 unit revenue growth of 1.4 percent was solid, but slower compared to last years growth rate. Inclement weather, a slowing economy, and higher fare levels likely combined to cool the rate of growth in domestic air travel.
Last years second quarter revenue performance was exceptionally strong, on the heels of major capacity reductions by various competitors. Based on first quarter results, April traffic to date and future second quarter bookings, we expect to fall below last years extraordinary second quarter unit revenue of 10.70 cents. We do expect the normal seasonal improvement in unit revenues from first to second quarter, however.
 
Despite $65 million in favorable cash settlements from derivative contracts for first quarter 2007, our economic fuel costs per gallon increased 11.6 percent to $1.63.
We have derivative contracts for over 95 percent of our estimated second quarter 2007 fuel consumption, capped at an average crude-equivalent price of approximately $50 per barrel (compared to
over 75 percent at approximately $36 per barrel for second quarter 2006)
.
Based on this derivative position and current market prices, we are hopeful our second quarter 2007 economic fuel costs will not exceed $1.70 per gallon. We currently have derivative contracts for approximately 90 percent of our estimated fuel consumption for the second half of 2007 at an average crude-equivalent price of approximately $50 per barrel.
 
As expected, our first quarter 2007 unit costs, excluding fuel, increased 1.7 percent over last year. Based on current cost trends, we expect our second quarter 2007 unit costs, excluding fuel, to be comparable to second quarter 2006s 6.68 cents.
We continue efforts to improve productivity and enhance the overall travel experience for our valued Customers. As always, we are dedicated to maintaining our Low Fare Leadership and strong Customer Satisfaction record and are proud that we were recently recognized by
BusinessWeek
on their list of the Top 25 Customer Service Champs. Southwest Airlines was also recognized for the eleventh consecutive year by
Fortune
as one of the Most Admired Companies in America. In addition,
Forbes
included Southwest in its Platinum List of Best Big Companies in America and
Business Ethics Magazine
recognized Southwest as one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens for the eighth year in a row.
"With the lowest overall unit costs (adjusted for stage length), strongest financial position, outstanding Customer Service, and best Employees in the U.S. airline industry, we are well positioned to maintain our profitability and expand our route system even during less than favorable economic times for our industry. Our focus is on preparing Southwest for the future and perhaps being less reliant on fare increases for future unit revenue growth. Although we continue to be challenged with higher fuel and other cost pressures, we believe we have substantial opportunities to grow our revenues over the next several years and are confident we can achieve our longterm financial goals.
We continue to actively explore the secondary aircraft market for additional aircraft and currently have intentions to lease two previously owned 737-700 aircraft, bringing our aircraft additions to 39 for this year. Our estimated year-over-year available seat mile growth for 2007 is approximately eight percent. In addition, we exercised two Boeing 737-700 options for 2008 delivery, bringing our 2008 firm orders and options to 32 and two, respectively. These aircraft will allow us to continue the successful development of our new markets and to respond to Customer demand in existing markets. We are also excited to resume service to San Francisco International Airport this fall.
Southwest will discuss its first quarter 2007 results on a conference call at
11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available

Operating Results
Total operating revenues for first quarter 2007 increased 8.9 percent to $2.2 billion, compared to $2.0 billion for first quarter 2006. Total first quarter 2007 operating expenses were $2.1 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in first quarter 2006. Operating income for first quarter 2007 was $84 million compared to $98 million in first quarter 2006. Economic operating income was $70 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $115 million last year.
                Other income was $65 million for first quarter 2007, compared to $2 million in other expenses for first quarter 2006. The $67 million swing primarily resulted from unrealized other (gains) losses associated with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended
. The cost of the hedging program (which includes the premium costs of derivative contracts) of $14 million in first quarter 2007 and $11 million in first quarter 2006 is also included in "other (gains) losses."
Net cash provided by operations for first quarter 2007 was $617 million, which included a $345 million increase in fuel derivative collateral deposits related to future periods. Capital expenditures were $325 million for first quarter 2007. The Company repurchased 13.5 million shares of its common stock for $209 million during the first quarter, of which $200 million completed the $400 million repurchase authorization by the Companys Board of Directors in November 2006. The remaining $9 million related to the $300
million repurchase program authorized last month. As of yesterday, the Company had repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for a total of $62.8 million under this latest authorization.
The Company ended first quarter 2007 with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, which included $885 million in fuel derivative collateral deposits. In addition, the Company had a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $600 million. The Company will repay approximately $113 million in debt in the remainder of 2007.
