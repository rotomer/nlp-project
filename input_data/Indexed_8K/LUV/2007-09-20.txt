c/o Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated 1585 Broadway New York, New York 10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Southwest Airlines Co., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), proposes that Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee under each of the Trusts (as defined below) (each, a "Trustee"), issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto Southwest Airlines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-1A (the "Class A Certificates") and Southwest Airlines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-1B (the "Class B Certificates", and, together with the Class A Certificates, the "Certificates"), in the aggregate principal amounts and with the interest rates and final expected distribution dates set forth on Schedule I hereto on the terms and conditions stated herein. The cash proceeds of the offering of Certificates by each Trust will be used by the Trustee to acquire the Equipment Notes (as defined in the Pass Through Trust Agreement described below) issued by the Company and secured by certain aircraft (the "Aircraft") owned by the Company.
The Certificates will be issued pursuant to a Pass Through Trust Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2005 (the "Basic Agreement") between the Company and the Trustee, as supplemented with respect to the issuance of each class of Certificates by a separate Pass Through Trust Supplement to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined below) (individually, a "Trust Supplement"), between the Company and the Trustee (the Basic Agreement as supplemented by each such Trust Supplement being referred to herein individually as a "Pass Through Trust Agreement"). The Trust Supplements are related to the creation and administration of Southwest Airlines Pass Through Trust 2007-1A (the "Class A Trust") and Southwest Airlines Pass Through Trust 2007-1B (the "Class B Trust", and, together with the Class A Trust, the "Trusts"). As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Underwriters" shall mean the firms named as Underwriters in Schedule II, and the term "you" shall mean collectively Morgan Stanley & Co.

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement and subject to paragraph (c) below, the Company will cause the Prospectus containing the information omitted in reliance upon Rule 430B, and any supplement thereto, to be filed in a form approved by you with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus as you shall reasonably request.
(b) The Company will notify you immediately (i) of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) of the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act that will be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) of the receipt after the date hereof of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, (iv) of any request by the Commission after the date hereof for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or for additional information, and (v) of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the 1933 Act concerning the Registration Statement, (vi) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Certificates and (vii) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Certificates for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof as soon as possible. The Company will file the pricing term sheet attached hereto as Schedule IV (the "Final Term Sheet") pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act within the time required by such Rule and will file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act.
(c) For so long as a Prospectus is required to be delivered in connection with the Certificates (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), the Company will give you notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether by the filing of documents pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise, and will furnish you with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed or prepared a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or preparation, as the case may be.
(d) The Company will deliver to you as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as you may reasonably request. The Company will furnish to you as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as you shall reasonably request, so long as you are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Certificates.
(e) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the General Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify you promptly so that any use of the General Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) subject to paragraph (c) above , amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(f) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Certificates (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and, subject to paragraph (c) above, file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act, or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement and Prospectus comply with such requirements. If, at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Certificates (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement relating to the Certificates or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify you and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
(g) With respect to the sale of the Certificates, the Company will make generally available to its security holders earning statements (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act), which will satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act.
(h) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with you, to qualify the Certificates for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as may be required for the distribution of the Certificates; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or to subject itself to taxation as doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise required to be so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Certificates have been qualified as provided above.
(i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall not, without your prior written consent, offer, sell, or enter into any agreement to sell (as public debt securities registered under the 1933 Act (other than the Certificates) or as debt securities which may be resold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act in reliance on Rule 144A thereunder and which are marketed through the use of a disclosure document containing substantially the same information as a prospectus for similar debt securities registered under the 1933 Act), any equipment notes, pass through certificates, equipment trust certificates or equipment purchase certificates secured by aircraft owned or leased by the Company (or rights relating thereto).
(j) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains your prior written consent, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and you, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Certificates that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the Final Term Sheet; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus. The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Issuer General Use Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.
6. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Certificates pursuant to this Agreement will be subject at all times to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated therein by reference), as of the Applicable Time and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance and observance by the Company of all covenants and agreements contained herein, on its part to be performed and observed and to the following additional conditions precedent:

8. .
Indemnification and Contribution; Default of Underwriters
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers, its affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the 1933 Act), its selling agent and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereof) or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Base Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus relating to the Certificates, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act Regulations or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in each case insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in any such document ("Underwriter Information").
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of the officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter but only with reference to the Underwriter Information provided by such Underwriter.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. The indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall, and the indemnifying party may elect to, retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and the indemnifying party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to retain counsel as required by the prior sentence to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable amount of time. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The firm chosen to represent the indemnified parties shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested in writing an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 90 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless such fees and expenses are being disputed in good faith. The indemnifying party at any time may, subject to the last sentence of this Section 8(c), settle or compromise any proceeding described in this paragraph at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is required to be made but is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then the applicable indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of such Certificates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of such Certificates shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the proceeds from the offering of such Certificates received by the Trusts (before deducting expenses) less total underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the Underwriters by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the Underwriters by the Company, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of such Certificates. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or information supplied by the Underwriters, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Certificates they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by it in respect of the Certificates underwritten by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro
rata
9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Certificates hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Certificates that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Certificates, you may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Certificates by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Certificates that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Certificates with respect to which such default or defaults occurs exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Certificates and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for purchase of such Certificates by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 7 and 8 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default by an Underwriter
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination, in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities shall have occurred in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any substantial national or international calamity or emergency shall occur and the effect of which is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Certificates on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus or (v) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such) as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Certificates on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. In the event of any such termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Section 8 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11 through 15 hereof shall remain in effect.
Termination
11. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Certificates. If for any reason the purchase of the Certificates by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 7 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Certificates by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the occurrence of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or 10, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of such Certificates and comply with its other obligations under Section 7.

This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, their respective successors and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of Certificates from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
14. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of each class of the Certificates and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters on the other, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
