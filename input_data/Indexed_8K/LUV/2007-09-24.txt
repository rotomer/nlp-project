Section 1.    Subject to the limitations and conditions as provided in this Article VIII, each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative (hereinafter called a "proceeding"), or any appeal in such a proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a proceeding, by reason of the fact that he (or a person of whom he is the legal representative) is or was a director or officer of the corporation (or while a director or officer of the corporation is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, Employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, trust, Employee benefit plan, or other enterprise) shall be indemnified by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the Texas Business Corporation Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees) actually incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding, appeal, inquiry or investigation, and indemnification under this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such person to indemnity hereunder; provided, however, that in no case shall the corporation indemnify any such person (or the legal representative of any such person) otherwise than for his reasonable expenses, in respect of any proceeding (i) in which such person shall have been finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction (after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom) to be liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by him, whether or not the benefit resulted from an action taken in such person's official capacity, or (ii) in which such person shall have been found liable to the corporation; and provided, further, that the corporation shall not indemnify any such person for his reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any proceeding in which he shall have been found liable for willful or intentional misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation.  The rights granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment, modification or repeal of this Article VIII shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or proceedings arising prior to any such amendment, modification or repeal.  It is expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this Article VIII could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict liability.
Right to Indemnification:
12
 
Section 2.    The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VIII shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the corporation the reasonable expenses incurred by a person of the type entitled to be indemnified under Section 1 who was, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding, in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding and without any determination as to the person's ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such person in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of a written affirmation by such person of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Article VIII and a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall be ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise.
Advance Payment:
Section 3.    The corporation, by adoption of a resolution of the Board of Directors, may indemnify and advance expenses to an Employee or agent of the corporation to the same extent and subject to the same conditions under which it may indemnify and advance expenses to directors and officers under this Article VIII; and the corporation may so indemnify and advance expenses to persons who are not or were not directors, officers, employees, or agents of the corporation but who are or were serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, Employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, trust, Employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in such a capacity or arising out of his status as such a person to the same extent that it may indemnify and advance expenses to directors and officers under this Article VIII.
Indemnification of Employees and Agents:
Section 4.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, the corporation may pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director or officer in connection with his appearance as a witness or his other participation in a proceeding at a time when he is not a named defendant or respondent in the proceeding.
Appearance as a Witness:
Section 5.    The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which a director or officer or other person indemnified pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VIII may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), provision of the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Nonexclusivity of Rights:
Section 6.  The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a director, officer, Employee, or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, Employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, Employee benefit plan, trust, or other enterprise against any expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss under this Article VIII.
Insurance:
Section 7.  To the extent required by law, any indemnification of or advance of expenses to a director or officer in accordance with this Article VIII shall be reported in writing to the shareholders with or before the notice or waiver of notice of the next shareholders' meeting or with or before the next submission to shareholders of a consent to action without a meeting and, in any case, within the 12-month period immediately following the date of the indemnification or advance.
Shareholder Notification:
Section 8.    If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each director, officer, and other person indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII to the extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VIII that shall not have been invalidated.

Third Quarter 2007 Investor Update                                                                                                                                                                         60;                                                          September 24, 2007
Operating Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM)

Operating Expenses per Available Seat Mile (CASM)
Project Early Departure
Project Early Departure is a voluntary program that was offered in July to eligible Employees who were ready to leave the Company.  It provides those Employees with a separation package, helps the Company balance costs, and allows us to continue offering low fares to our Customers.  The Company offered a cash bonus of $25,000 plus medical/dental continuation coverage and travel privileges based on eligibility.
A total of 608 out of approximately 8,500 eligible Employees elected the early-out program.  The number of Employees from each group that accepted the package is as follows: 395 from Reservations, 165 from Ground Operations, 41 from Inflight and seven from Provisioning.  The participants last day of work will fall between September 30, 2007 and April 30, 2008 based on the operational needs of particular work locations and departments.  The Company did not have a target or expectation for the number of Employees expected to accept the package.
Project Early Departure resulted in a pre-tax, pre-profitsharing, one-time charge of approximately $25 million during third quarter 2007.  These charges are reflected in Salaries, wages and benefits.  The Company anticipates that future cost savings will be approximately $20 million annually through 2012.  The Company will continue to address future staffing needs, but currently anticipates that the majority of the positions will be filled with entry-level Employees to meet operational demands.  The purpose of this voluntary initiative and other initiatives is to help the Company absorb cost pressures, such as higher wage rates and the increase in fuel prices.
CASM
Including the charge related to Project Early Departure, both third quarter 2007 economic CASM and GAAP CASM are expected to increase in the four to five percent range year-over-year from third quarter 2006s 8.75 cents (economic excludes certain unrealized hedging items).
Other (Gains) Losses, net
The Company currently expects third quarter 2007 premiums related to its fuel hedging program to be in the $15 million range.  This charge, among other items, is reflected in "Other (Gains) Losses, net."
