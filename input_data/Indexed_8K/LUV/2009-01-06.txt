Item 2.03.    Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On December 30, 2008, the Company closed its previously announced private placement, pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, of $400 million of its Senior Secured Notes due 2011 (the "Notes").
The Notes will mature on December 15, 2011, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 10.5% per annum from the closing. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually, beginning June 15, 2009.
The Notes are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in a specified pool of 17 Boeing 737-700 aircraft granted under a single mortgage. The Notes are non-callable by the Company prior to stated maturity; however, the Notes are subject to redemption at par in certain circumstances involving a casualty loss of an aircraft securing the Notes.
The Notes have the benefit of conventional events of default and acceleration provisions, but have no financial covenants.
The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer by the holders. The Company has no obligation to register the Notes for public resale.
The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes, and such purposes may include using a portion of the proceeds to provide cash collateral for some of the Company's fuel hedging arrangements.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
