On April 3, 2009, the Registrant issued a press release announcing March 2009 traffic and other information. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.
The information furnished in this Item 2.02 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
On April 2, 2009, the Company documented and closed the first tranche of what is expected to be a two tranche sale and leaseback transaction with a third party aircraft lessor for the sale and leaseback of a total of six of the Company's Boeing 737-700 aircraft. On that date, the Company sold three of its Boeing 737-700 aircraft for a total of approximately $105 million and immediately leased the aircraft back for twelve years. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company will continue to operate and maintain the aircraft. The Company will make monthly payments aggregating approximately $4.6 million for these aircraft for the first six months of the leases, which payments are based on the six-month LIBOR rate as of March 30, 2009. Payments under the lease agreements will be reset every six months based on changes in the six-month LIBOR rate. The lease agreements contain standard termination events, including termination upon a breach of the Company's obligations to make rental payments and upon any other material breach of the Company's obligations under the leases, and standard maintenance and return condition provisions. Upon a termination of the lease upon a breach by the Company, the Company would be liable for standard contractual damages, possibly including damages suffered by the lessor in connection with remarketing the aircraft or while the aircraft is not leased to another party. Subject to documentation and customary closing conditions, the Company expects to close the second tranche of the transaction, which would provide for the sale and 16-year leaseback of the remaining three Boeing 737-700 aircraft upon similar terms (including proceeds), in the second quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
