DALLAS, TEXAS  April 21, 2011  Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) today reported first quarter 2011 net income of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11 million, or $.01 per diluted share, for first quarter 2010.   Both periods results included special items related to non-cash, mark-to-market, and other items associated with a portion of the Companys fuel hedge portfolio.   In addition, first quarter 2011 results included approximately $9 million in charges (net of profitsharing and taxes) primarily related to consulting fees in association with the Companys proposed acquisition of AirTran Holdings, Inc.*  Excluding special items in both periods, first quarter 2011 net income was $20 million, or $.03 per diluted share, compared to $24 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for first quarter 2010.  Operating income was $114 million for first quarter 2011, compared to $54 million for first quarter 2010.  Excluding special items in both periods, operating income was $110 million for first quarter 2011 compared to $102 million for first quarter 2010.  Additional information regarding special items is included in this release and in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Gary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, stated,
While escalating jet fuel prices and inclement weather challenged our first quarter profitability, our People prevailed.  We are very pleased to report first quarter 2011 operating income of $110 million and net income of $20 million(each excluding special items).  Record monthly load factors, combined with solid passenger revenue yields, resulted in a 17.8 percent year-over-year increase in passenger revenues.  Passenger unit revenues increased almost nine percent, compared to first quarter last year, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of record passenger unit revenues.  Since first quarter 2007, passenger unit revenues have increased 34 percent.  Other operating revenues also grew a healthy 26.7 percent, compared to a year ago, largely due to growth in our EarlyBird Check-In revenues, which nearly doubled.  All in all, a solid start to our 40 year of service.

Based on bookings and revenue trends thus far, the Company expects another solid unit revenue improvement in second quarter 2011*, even with the continuation of difficult year-over-year comparisons.
First quarter 2011 unit costs, excluding special items, increased 9.2 percent from first quarter 2010, mostly due to a 26.5 percent year-over-year increase in economic fuel costs per gallon.   First quarter 2011 economic fuel costs of $2.96 per gallon included $13 million, or $0.03 per gallon, in unfavorable cash settlements for fuel derivative contracts.  Based on the Companys second quarter 2011 fuel hedge position and market prices (as of April 19), second quarter 2011 economic fuel costs*, including fuel taxes, are estimated to be approximately $3.35 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon in favorable cash settlements for fuel derivative contracts.  Additional information regarding the Companys fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.
th
Excluding fuel and special items in both periods, first quarter 2011 unit costs increased 1.9 percent from first quarter 2010, as anticipated.  Based on current cost trends, the Company expects the year-over-year increase in its second quarter 2011 nonfuel unit costs*, excluding special items, will exceed first quarter 2011s year-over-year increase, largely due to advertising related to the launch of its All-New Rapid Rewardsprogram.  However, full year 2011 nonfuel unit costs*, excluding special items, currently are estimated to increase approximately two percent from 2010.
 
In the first quarter, the Company was able to grow revenues sufficient to cover soaring jet fuel prices. Traffic and revenue trends remained strong, offsetting the impact of a 36.7 percent year-over-year increase in first quarter 2011 economic fuel and oil expense.  For 2011*, the Company is planning to increase its available seat mile capacity in the five to six percent range, as compared to 2010, primarily as a function of increased aircraft utilization. However, given the current outlook of continually rising jet fuel prices, the Company is planning cautiously for 2012.
Kelly continued, First quarter 2011 was very active for Southwest, and it was very gratifying.  After years in development, we launched our All-New Rapid Rewards program. Growth in our program has been strong and surpassed our system averages. We launched new service to Charleston and Greenville-Spartanburg airports very successfully. Those markets have been underserved and overpriced, and we were welcomed enthusiastically by the people of South Carolina. We jumped at the opportunity to acquire slots and terminal facilities in Newark, where we also were warmly welcomed when we launched service there last month.  Much progress was made towards the 2012 introduction of the Boeing 737-800 model to our fleet.  Finally, we made tremendous progress in our integration planning for the acquisition of AirTran Airways. I am very proud of what our hard-working People accomplished already in 2011.

With the overwhelming approval of AirTran stockholders in March, we are ready to move forward with the closing of the transaction, now planned for May 2.  We anticipate that all regulatory approvals needed to move forward will be obtained by that date.  We look forward to that milestone day, first and foremost, to finally welcome the AirTran Crew Members to the Southwest family.  Together, we can then begin the exciting work to integrate AirTran into Southwest.

 On September 27, 2010, Southwest Airlines announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of AirTran Holdings, Inc., the parent company of AirTran Airways (AirTran), for a combination of cash and Southwest Airlines common stock.  The acquisition will significantly expand Southwest Airlines low-fare service to many more Customers in many more domestic markets.  Moreover, the transaction has the potential to yield net annual synergies of more than $400 million by 2013.   Excluding one-time acquisition and integration costs estimated to be approximately $500 million, the transaction is expected to be accretive to Southwests fully-diluted earnings per share within the first twelve months following the close of the transaction, and strongly accretive, thereafter, upon full realization of the estimated net synergies.
Operationally, the Employees of Southwest Airlines exhibited their exceptional resilience to successfully manage over 3,000 flight cancellations from weather interruptions in the first quarter, stated Kelly.  It is their resolve to provide outstanding Customer Service that continues to gain us honors and recognition, such as recently being named the fourth most admired Company in the world in magazines 2011 survey of corporate reputations.

Operating Results
Total operating revenues for first quarter 2011 increased 18.0 percent to $3.1 billion, compared to $2.6 billion for first quarter 2010.  Total first quarter 2011 operating expenses were $3.0 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in first quarter 2010.  Operating income for first quarter 2011 was $114 million, compared to $54 million in first quarter 2010.  Excluding special items in both periods, operating income was $110 million for first quarter 2011 compared to $102 million for first quarter 2010. The Companys return on invested capital (before taxes and excluding special items) was approximately ten percent for the twelve months ended March 31, , compared to approximately five percent for the twelve months ended March 31, .  Additional information regarding pretax return on invested capital is included in the accompanying reconciliation tables. 
2011
2010
Other expenses increased to $96 million in first quarter 2011 from $37 million in first quarter 2010. The $59 million increase in total other expenses primarily resulted from $29 million in other losses recognized in first quarter 2011 versus $27 million in other gains recognized in first quarter 2010.  In both periods, these other gains/losses primarily resulted from unrealized gains/losses associated with the Companys fuel hedging program.  Other losses, net also included premium costs associated with the Companys fuel derivative contracts of $31 million in both first quarter 2011 and first quarter 2010.
The Companys effective tax rate was approximately 72 percent in first quarter 2011 compared to 35 percent in first quarter 2010.  The higher rate in first quarter 2011 primarily was due to a $5 million increase in income tax expense from an IRS settlement during first quarter 2011 related to tax years 2007 through 2009, and a $2 million increase from a State of Illinois tax law change that occurred during the first quarter 2011.  The Company projects a full year 2011* effective tax rate of approximately 40 percent based on currently forecasted financial results.
Net cash provided by operations for first quarter 2011 was $965 million, and capital expenditures were $57 million, resulting in over $900 million in free cash flow. In addition to a fully available, unsecured, revolving credit facility of $600 million, the Company currently has over $4 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
* The closing of the proposed acquisition of AirTran is anticipated to occur on May 2, 2011.  Forward looking commentary in this release and the accompanying tables including, but not limited to, revenues, costs, fuel consumption, fleet, and available seat miles for 2011 and beyond, excludes any potential impact of the acquisition.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current intent, expectations, and projections and are not guarantees of future performance.  These statements involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by them.  Factors include, among others, (i) changes in the price of aircraft fuel, the impact of hedge accounting, and any changes to the Companys fuel hedging strategies and positions; (ii) the impact of the economy on demand for air travel and fluctuations in consumer demand generally for the Companys services; (iii) the impact of fuel prices and economic conditions on the Companys overall business plan and strategies; (iv) actions of competitors, including without limitation pricing, scheduling, and capacity decisions, and consolidation and alliance activities; (v) the Companys ability to timely and effectively implement, transition, and maintain the necessary information technology systems and infrastructure to support its operations and initiatives; (vi) the Companys dependence on third parties to assist with implementation of certain of its initiatives; (vii) the impact of governmental regulations on the Companys operations; (viii) the possibility that the Companys proposed acquisition of AirTran is delayed or does not close, including due to the failure of closing conditions; (ix) the Companys ability to successfully integrate AirTrans business and realize the expected synergies from the transaction; and (x) other factors, as described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the detailed factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and in the Companys registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes a proxy statement of AirTran that also constitutes a prospectus of the Company.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
The Company's Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These GAAP financial statements include unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging. 
As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information, including results, that it refers to as "economic," which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company's economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts--all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP  (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. These economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Companys operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
 
Further information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements and accounting associated with accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
 
In addition to its economic financial measures, as defined above, the Company has also provided other non-GAAP financial measures as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations.  These include a first quarter 2011 charge of $17 million (before the impact of profitsharing and/or taxes) related to expenses associated with the Company's planned acquisition of AirTran.  The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to evaluate the results on a comparative basis with results in current or prior periods that did not include such items and as a basis for expecting operating results in future periods.
