DALLAS, TEXAS  August 4, 2011  Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) (the Company) today reported second quarter 2011 net income of $161 million, or $.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $112 million, or $.15 per diluted share, for second quarter 2010.  Operating income was $207 million for second quarter 2011, compared to $363 million for second quarter 2010.  The 2011 results include the results of AirTran since the May 2, 2011, acquisition date.  Prior periods do not include AirTrans results.
Both periods results included special items related to non-cash, mark-to-market, and other items associated with a portion of the Companys fuel hedge portfolio.   In addition, second quarter 2011 results included approximately $40 million (net of taxes) in charges primarily related to financial advisory fees and severance payments in association with the Companys acquisition and integration of AirTran.  Excluding special items in both periods, second quarter 2011 net income was $121 million, or $.15 per diluted share, compared to $216 million, or $.29 per diluted share, for second quarter 2010.  Additional information regarding special items is included in this release and in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
Gary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, stated,
With energy prices surging, and Brent crude oil near $120 a barrel, significant revenue growth was critical to achieve second quarter 2011 operating income of $276 million and net income of $121 million (both excluding special items).  Record load factors and record passenger yields resulted in a record $3.9 billion in passenger revenues.  Still, with our economic fuel costs rising 72 percent, our year-over-year revenue growth could not keep pace.  However, total operating revenues of $4.1 billion, another record, is a notable accomplishment.
 Southwest Airlines celebrated a momentous milestone this quarter with the closing of our AirTran acquisition, and it couldnt have come at a more critical time with volatile fuel prices and economic uncertainty.  We have the opportunity to optimize AirTrans flight schedule to boost its profitability. Ultimately, integrating their network into Southwests provides even more substantial opportunities to boost combined revenues and profits.  The acquisition has the dual benefit of positioning the Company for future growth in an improving economic environment or cushioning it against worsening economic conditions.  As we undertake the multi-year effort to successfully integrate AirTran into Southwest Airlines, we will continue to focus on our safe, efficient, and reliable operations; strong Culture; and outstanding Customer Service.

AirTran became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on May 2, 2011. Second quarter 2011 results discussed in this release and provided in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Comparative Consolidated Operating Statistics include the results of operations and cash flows for AirTran from May 2, 2011 through June 30, 2011, including the impact of purchase accounting.  Periods presented prior to the acquisition date do not include AirTrans results.  However, the Company believes the analysis of specified financial results on a combined basis provides more meaningful year-over-year comparability.  Financial information on a combined basis is the sum of the historical financial results of the Company and AirTran for periods prior to the acquisition date, but includes the impact of purchase accounting only as of May 2, 2011.  Supplemental financial information on a combined basis and accompanying reconciliations have been included in this release and at .

Financial Results
The Companys total operating revenues for second quarter 2011 increased 30.6 percent to $4.1 billion, compared to $3.2 billion for second quarter 2010.  Operating unit revenues increased 5.7 percent compared to second quarter 2010.  On a combined basis, operating unit revenues increased 7.4 percent from second quarter 2010.  Based on bookings and revenue trends thus far, the Company expects third quarter 2011 unit revenues to improve from third quarter 2010s combined unit revenue performance of 12.13 cents.
Total second quarter 2011 operating expenses were $3.9 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in second quarter 2010.  Excluding special items, second quarter 2011 unit costs increased 13.5 percent from second quarter 2010, mostly due to a 38.4 percent year-over-year increase in economic fuel costs per gallon.   Second quarter 2011 economic fuel costs of $3.28 per gallon included $0.03 per gallon in favorable cash settlements for fuel derivative contracts.  Based on the Companys third quarter 2011 fuel hedge position and market prices (as of August 1), third quarter 2011 economic fuel costs, including fuel taxes, are estimated to be approximately $3.30 per gallon.  Additional information regarding the Companys fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.
st
Excluding fuel and special items in both periods, second quarter 2011 unit costs increased 1.4 percent from second quarter 2010.  On a combined basis, nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items, increased 3.1 percent from second quarter last year.  Based on current cost trends, the Company expects its third quarter 2011 unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to increase from third quarter 2010s combined unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, of 7.27 cents.

AirTran Acquisition
 Of course, the highlight of the quarter was welcoming AirTran to the Southwest family on May 2, stated Kelly.  Our integration efforts are well underway, and I am pleased with our progress thus far.  We implemented a new leadership structure for the combined companies following the acquisition, and Employee communication channels were enhanced to ensure Employees of both airlines remain well-informed of the integration plans and progress.  We have streamlined a number of corporate functions and renegotiated many contracts, which will produce approximately $50 million (before taxes and profitsharing) in annualized cost synergies.
nd
Our labor workgroups are making good progress on seniority list integration discussions.  The Pilot negotiating committees of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) have agreed on a framework for seniority list integration.  The agreement has been unanimously approved by the SWAPA Board.  If approved by the ALPA Board, the agreement will go to the memberships for ratification.  I commend our Pilots for their dedication and leadership to have already accomplished this integral step towards a successful integration.
 Although AirTran is expected to operate under the AirTran brand for another couple of years, stations with a dual airline presence are being transitioned to locate ticket counters and gates in closer proximity. We will begin transitioning aircraft, airports, and Employees next year.  We expect to receive our single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration in first quarter 2012.
These accomplishments, among many others, are noteworthy in just three months time.  I thank all of our hard-working Employees for their unwavering efforts as we integrate these two great companies, and position Southwest for an exciting and healthy future.
The Company has incurred $75 million in costs associated with the acquisition and integration of AirTran during 2011, of which $58 million were in second quarter 2011.  The Company expects total acquisition and integration costs will be approximately $500 million.  Including the anticipated benefit of net synergies, but excluding the impact of acquisition and integration costs, the Company expects the acquisition to be accretive to its fully-diluted earnings per share in 2011, as it was in second quarter 2011.  The Company currently estimates that net annual pre-tax synergies will exceed $400 million by 2013.
Capacity Plans
Kelly continued, Given the pessimistic near-term outlook for fuel prices and the U.S. economy, we have re-evaluated our capacity plans.  We trimmed our 2012 winter schedule, published last week, which began to coordinate the Southwest and AirTran networks.  We have reduced our planned 2012 capacity to be equal to or less than our 2011 combined available seat miles.  We will be aggressive in our efforts to optimize our combined networks and redeploy capacity more profitably.
The Company expects its 2011 combined available seat miles to grow in the four to five percent range as compared to its 2010 combined capacity.

Liquidity
Net cash provided by operations for second quarter 2011 was $237 million and capital expenditures were $215 million.  The acquisition of AirTran was funded with $518 million of cash on hand, and 44 million shares of the Companys common stock.   After considering the cash balances acquired from AirTran, the net cash outlay was $35 million. Subsequent to the acquisition date, convertible notes previously held by AirTran note holders were either converted or called by the Company for an aggregate of approximately seven million shares of the Companys common stock and $81 million in cash.  The Companys $600 million bank credit facility, which was due to expire in October 2012, was replaced during the second quarter with a new, five-year, $800 million unsecured revolving credit line.  The Company also terminated AirTrans $100 million combined revolving credit and letter of credit facility.  As of June 30, 2011, the Company had $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which did not include $85 million in net cash collateral held by its fuel hedge counterparties.
Net cash provided by operations for first half 2011 was $1.2 billion, and capital expenditures were $272 million, resulting in approximately $900 million in free cash flow.  The Company repaid $143 million in debt during first half 2011, and is scheduled to repay approximately $494 million in debt for the remainder of 2011, and approximately $560 million in 2012.  The Company expects to generate free cash flow for all of 2011, based on current trends and projected 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $900 million.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, asamended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
The Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These GAAP financial statements include unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging.
 
As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as economic, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Companys economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts--all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Companys actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. These economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Companys fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Companys management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Companys operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
 
Further information on (i) the Companys fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements and accounting associated with accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
 
In addition to its economic financial measures, as defined above, the Company has also provided non-GAAP financial measures as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations.  These include charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 of $58 million and $75 million, respectively (before the impact of profitsharing and/or taxes) related to expenses associated with the Companys acquisition and integration of AirTran.  The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to evaluate the results on a comparative basis with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods.  As a result of the Companys acquisition of AirTran, which closed on May 2, 2011, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies.  While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results.
 
The Company has also provided other supplemental non-GAAP financial information on a combined basis.  This supplemental non-GAAP financial information on a combined basis includes specified combined financial results of the Company and AirTran for periods prior to May 2, 2011, as if the acquisition had occurred prior to the beginning of the applicable reporting period, but excludes any impact of purchase accounting prior to May 2, 2011.  AirTrans historical financial information included in the combined presentation has been conformed to the Companys financial statement classification where appropriate.  The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of combined results in order to evaluate its prior, current or future period results on a more meaningful, consistent year-over-year basis.
