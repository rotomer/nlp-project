DALLAS, TEXAS  January 19, 2012  Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) (the Company) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2011 results.  Fourth quarter 2011 net income was $152 million, or $.20 per diluted share, which included $86 million (net) of favorable special items.  This compared to net income of $131 million, or $.18 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2010, which included favorable special items totaling $16 million (net).  Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2011 net income was $66 million, or $.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $115 million, or $.15 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2010.  This exceeded Thomsons First Call mean estimate of $.08 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2011.  Additional information regarding special items is included in this release and in the accompanying reconciliation tables.
For the full year 2011, net income was $178 million, or $.23 per diluted share, which included $152 million (net) of unfavorable special items. This compared to $459 million, or $.61 per diluted share, for full year 2010, which included $91 million (net) of unfavorable special items.  Excluding special items, full year 2011 net income was $330 million, or $.43 per diluted share, compared to net income of $550 million, or $.74 per diluted share, for full year 2010.
Gary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, stated,
Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2011 net income was $66 million, and full year 2011 net income was $330 million.  We had an outstanding revenue performance.  Our fourth quarter operating revenues were a record $4.1 billion.Fourth quarter passenger revenues were strong, driven by record yields and continued high load factors.  Compared to the prior year, our fourth quarter passenger unit revenues increased 8.2 percent (on a combined basis, as defined below).  Based on current traffic and booking trends, we expect another strong passenger revenue performance in first quarter of 2012.
  
While it is always disappointing to report a year-over-year decline in profits (excluding special items), the fourth quarter and full year declines were primarily caused by significantly higher fuel prices.  Our fourth quarter economic fuel costs per gallon increased 33.7 percent to $3.29, compared to our combined fuel costs of $2.46 per gallon in fourth quarter last year.  Our full year 2011 combined economic fuel costs were $3.18 per gallon, an increase of 34.7 percent, compared to our combined fuel costs of $2.36 per gallon last year.  Based on market prices as of January 13, our first quarter 2012 economic fuel costs, including fuel taxes, are estimated to be approximately $3.35 per gallon, compared to our combined economic fuel costs, including fuel taxes, of $2.95 per gallon in first quarter last year.  High energy prices demand continued focus on improving productivity and eliminating waste.
th
 Despite the decline in earnings, 2011 was a momentous year at Southwest Airlines.  We celebrated our 40year of providing legendary low fare, high quality, domestic air travel and delivered our 39 consecutive year of profits to our Shareholders.  We launched service to Greenville-Spartanburg and Charleston, South Carolina and Newark, New Jersey within two weeks time, increasing Southwests domestic footprint to 72 cities.  In March, we launched our All-New Rapid Rewards program.  The completely revamped, industry-leading frequent flyer program continues to grow at a strong pace.  Results, thus far, are well beyond our expectations.
th
th
On May 2, we acquired AirTran Airways, increasing our fleet by 140 aircraft, and extending our combined network into key markets we didnt previously serve, such as Atlanta and Washington, D.C., via Ronald Reagan National Airport, as well as many smaller domestic cities and leisure markets in the Caribbean and Mexico.   We also expanded our presence at New York LaGuardia, Boston, Milwaukee, and Baltimore/Washington.
nd
While it will take several years to fully integrate AirTran into Southwest Airlines, I am very proud of the tremendous progress in only eight months time.  We are on track to obtain our single operating certificate this quarter. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association and the Air Line Pilots Association took the lead on negotiating a seniority list integration (SLI) agreement that was ratified by both Pilot groups.  The Flight Attendants, Mechanics, and Flight Instructors unions have tentative SLI agreements, currently out for vote by the memberships.  As a result of the superb efforts of our People, we are already producing over $200 million of net annualized pre-tax synergies, which is 50 percent of our $400 million target by 2013 (excluding acquisition and integration expenses).  For 2011, we realized $80 million in net pre-tax synergies, and the acquisition was modestly accretive to our 2011 results, excluding special items, as planned.
The Company incurred $134 million in expenses (before taxes) associated with the acquisition and integration of AirTran during 2011, including $37 million in fourth quarter 2011.  The Company expects total acquisition and integration expenses will be approximately $500 million.
Kelly continued, In December, we unveiled our fleet modernization plans, including the launch of the B737-MAX aircraft beginning in 2017, representing our fourth time as Boeings launch customer.  Our agreements with Boeing afford us significant flexibility to replace our older, less efficient aircraft with new Boeing 737-700/800 aircraft and the B737-MAX aircraft.  During 2012, we will take delivery of 33 737-800s, with the first delivery of the -800 model to Southwest scheduled for March.  Earlier this week, we announced the final prong of our fleet modernization plans.  Leveraging the new Boeing Sky Interior from the -800 model, we decided to retrofit our -700 fleet with an updated cabin interior.  is a -700 cabin refresh intended to enhance Customer comfort, personal space, and the overall travel experience.  It allows for the added benefit of six additional seats, along with more climate-friendly and cost-effective materials.  Our fleet modernization plans have been designed to drive significant value in the near and long term.
Evolve: The New Southwest Experience
Operationally, we finished the year strong with our highest December ontime performance in 15 years.  Our People continue to deliver outstanding levels of Customer Service, as recognized by Southwest Airlines being named the 2011 Customer Service Champion by J.D. Powers, and the Customer Satisfaction Leader in Consumer Reports list of airline ratings.
 I commend each of our 45,000+ Warriors for their hard work and notable accomplishments.  We accomplished everything we set out to do in 2011, with soaring fuel costs the only disappointment.  As we prepare for our next 40 years, our target is fixed on a 15 percent pretax return on invested capital.  Capital commitments for 2012 are approximately $1.3 billion, our 2012 capacity is estimated to be flat with 2011, and we currently plan to end 2012 with 691 aircraft in our fleet.  Future capital spending will be carefully monitored with a focus on generating free cash flow.  We are committed to providing exceptional Customer Service at everyday low fares; focused on investing in the Customer Experience while preserving our low cost position; and engaged in our strategic initiatives to drive Shareholder value.
Financial Results and Outlook
AirTran Airways, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on May 2, 2011. Results discussed in this release and provided in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Comparative Consolidated Operating Statistics include the results of operations and cash flows for AirTran from May 2 through December 31, 2011, including the impact of purchase accounting.  Periods presented prior to the acquisition date do not include AirTrans results.  However, the Company believes the analysis of specified financial results on a combined basis provides more meaningful year-over-year comparability.  Financial information presented on a combined basis is the sum of the historical financial results of the Company and AirTran for periods prior to the acquisition date, but includes the impact of purchase accounting only as of May 2, 2011.  Supplemental financial information presented on a combined basis and the accompanying reconciliations have been included in this release.
The Companys total operating revenues in fourth quarter 2011 increased 31.9 percent to $4.1 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in fourth quarter 2010, and increased 9.3 percent compared to $3.8 billion for combined fourth quarter 2010 total operating revenues.  Operating unit revenues increased 7.0 percent from fourth quarter 2010, on a combined basis.
 Total fourth quarter 2011 operating expenses were $4.0 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in fourth quarter 2010, and compared to $3.5 billion for combined fourth quarter 2010 total operating expenses.  Excluding special items in both periods, fourth quarter 2011 unit costs increased 10.8 percent from fourth quarter 2010 combined unit costs, largely due to a 33.7 percent year-over-year increase in economic fuel costs per gallon.   Fourth quarter 2011 economic fuel costs of $3.29 per gallon included $0.12 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements for fuel derivative contracts; however, fuel derivative contract premiums are down significantly year-over-year, as described below in other income.  Additional information regarding the Companys fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.
Excluding fuel and special items in both periods, fourth quarter 2011 unit costs increased 0.5 percent from fourth quarter 2010s combined 7.72 cents.  Based on current cost trends, the Company expects another year-over-year increase in its first quarter 2012 unit costs, compared to first quarter 2011s combined unit costs of 7.83 cents, excluding fuel and special items in both periods.
Operating income for fourth quarter 2011 was $147 million, compared to $216 million in fourth quarter 2010.  Excluding special items in both periods, operating income was $167 million for fourth quarter 2011, compared to $263 million in fourth quarter 2010, and compared to $278 million for combined fourth quarter 2010 operating income.
Other income for the fourth quarter was $108 million compared to $3 million of other expenses for fourth quarter 2010.  This $111 million swing primarily resulted from $153 million in gains recognized in fourth quarter 2011, compared to $31 million in gains recognized in fourth quarter 2010.  In both periods, these gains primarily resulted from unrealized gains/losses associated with a portion of the Companys fuel hedging portfolio.  Excluding these special items, other losses were primarily attributable to the premium costs associated with the Companys fuel derivative contracts.  Fourth quarter 2011 premium costs were $14 million, compared to $44 million in fourth quarter 2010, on a combined basis. First quarter 2012 premium costs are currently estimated to be approximately $6 million, compared to combined premium costs of $36 million in first quarter 2011.
Total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 29.4 percent to $15.7 billion, while total operating expenses increased 34.6 percent to $15.0 billion, resulting in operating income of $693 million, compared to $988 million for the year ended 2010.  Excluding special items in both periods, operating income was $839 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.2 billion in 2010.  On a combined basis, total operating revenues for 2011 increased 12.7 percent to $16.6 billion, while total operating expenses increased 17.3 percent to $15.9 billion, resulting in combined operating income for 2011 of $662 million, compared to $1.1 billion for 2010.  Excluding special items in both periods, combined operating income for 2011 was $834 million, compared to $1.3 billion for 2010.
The Companys return on invested capital (before taxes and excluding special items) was approximately seven percent for the year ended December 31, 2011, including AirTrans results beginning May 2, 2011.  Additional information regarding pretax return on invested capital is included in the accompanying reconciliation tables. 
Liquidity
Net cash provided by operations for 2011 was $1.4 billion, and capital expenditures were $968 million.  As a result, the Company generated over $400 million in free cash flow* in 2011.
On August 5, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $500 million of the Companys common stock. During 2011, the Company purchased approximately 27.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $225 million.  The Company repaid $638 million in debt during 2011, and is scheduled to repay approximately $560 million debt in 2012, including $430 million in first quarter 2012.  After this planned first quarter debt payment, the Company will have reduced debt by approximately $1 billion since acquiring AirTran in May 2011.  As of January 18, the Company had approximately $3.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.   In addition, the Company also had a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $800 million.

NOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance.
 
As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as economic, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Companys economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts--all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Companys actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. These economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Companys fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Companys management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Companys operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
 
Further information on (i) the Companys fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements and accounting associated with accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, as well as subsequent quarterly filings.
 
In addition to its economic financial measures, as defined above, the Company has also provided other non-GAAP financial measures as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations.  These include charges for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 of $37 million and $134 million, respectively (before the impact of profitsharing and/or taxes) related to expenses associated with the Companys acquisition and integration of AirTran.  These also include a 2011 charge of $17 million (before the impact of profitsharing and/or taxes) for an asset impairment related to the Companys recent decision not to equip its Classic (737-300/500) aircraft with Required Navigation Performance (RNP) capabilities.  The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to evaluate the results on a comparative basis with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods.  As a result of the Companys acquisition of AirTran, which closed on May 2, 2011, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies.  While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results.
 
The Company has also provided other supplemental non-GAAP financial information on a combined basis.  This supplemental non-GAAP financial information on a combined basis includes specified combined financial results of the Company and AirTran for periods prior to May 2, 2011, as if the acquisition had occurred prior to the beginning of the applicable reporting period, but excludes any impact of purchase accounting prior to May 2, 2011.  AirTrans historical financial information included in the combined presentation has been conformed to the Companys financial statement classification where appropriate.  The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of combined results in order to evaluate its prior, current or future period results on a more meaningful, consistent year-over-year basis.
 
The Company has also provided free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  The Company believes free cash flow is a meaningful measure because it demonstrates the Companys ability to service its debt, pay dividends and make investments to enhance shareholder value.  Although free cash flow is a commonly used as measure of liquidity, definitions of free cash flow may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for free cash flow.   For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company generated over $400 million in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $1.4 billion less capital expenditures of $968 million.
