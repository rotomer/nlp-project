EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibits: 99 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated October 10, 2002

Exhibit 99 Lexmark International expects third-quarter earnings to exceed previous guidance - -- Results include CRM software write-off -- Lexington, Ky., Oct. 10, 2002 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) announced today that it expects a third-quarter 2002 year-over-year revenue growth rate of 4 to 5 percent and earnings per share of 68 to 70 cents, as compared to 52 cents a year earlier. On July 22, 2002, the company provided guidance for a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits and earnings per share in the range of 58 to 68 cents. The revised 68 to 70 cent range is after including the effect of an asset impairment related to the abandonment of a customer relationship management (CRM) software project. The abandonment results in the write-off of $15.8 million, or 9 cents per share, in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2002, the company currently expects a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits and earnings per share in the range of 67 to 77 cents. In the same period last year, the company reported earnings per share of 46 cents on an operational basis, before non-recurring charges. The company will have no comment on its third-quarter results or fourth-quarter guidance until its previously scheduled earnings conference call on Monday, Oct. 21, 2002.
