EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated April 26, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports record revenue and EPS for first quarter o Supplies sales drive growth o Strong laser printer sales in the quarter o Company repurchases a record $227 million of its common stock Lexington, Ky., April 26, 2005 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2005. First quarter revenue was $1.358 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared to $1.256 billion last year. EPS were $0.96 and would have been $0.99 without the items described below. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the first quarter as a result of aggressive pricing and soft consumer market demand. "Our revenue growth in the quarter was driven mainly by supplies, reflecting the consistency of our business model, and also by strong demand for our laser printers. We continued our increased investments in R&D and branding in the first quarter in support of our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. First quarter operating income includes a $9.6 million, or 5 cents per share, charge which represents management's best estimate of probable losses relating to 2002 through 2004 accounts receivable in Spain due to inappropriate conduct by a former employee of Lexmark Spain. Also included in earnings per share is a benefit of 2 cents from the retroactive extension of a favorable non-U.S. tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter were a record $0.96. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been $0.99, up from $0.91 in the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin was 33.0 percent for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement compared to 32.7 percent a year ago. Operating expenses were 21.0 percent of revenue, up from 19.6 percent in the prior year, driven by the charge and continued strategic investments in development and marketing. Operating income was $161.7 million compared to $165.2 million last year. Excluding the charge, operating income would have been a record $171.3 million. Lexmark repurchased a record $227 million of its common stock during the quarter. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $675 million at
quarter-end. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million. Lexmark increases participation in photo printing with new All-In-Ones In keeping with its strategy to increase participation in high-growth segments such as inkjet photo printing, the company today announced two inkjet All-In-One (AIO) products that print, copy, scan, and make printing digital photos easy. Affordably priced to appeal to a broad group of consumers at $79 after rebate and $129 respectively, the Lexmark X3350 and the Lexmark P4350 are both equipped with embedded pictbridge support that make it fast and simple to print borderless 4x6 prints directly from a digital camera. The Lexmark P4350 also features photo card slots and a 1.7 inch color LCD screen, an industry first for sub-$150 AIOs. Looking forward In the second quarter of 2005, the company expects a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the mid-single digit range and earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.11, compared to $1.02 in the same quarter a year ago. The company believes that the appeal and ease of use of its product line and the strength of its supplies-driven business model will contribute to future growth. However, the potential for weakening market demand and for aggressive price competition continue. During the second quarter, the company will be evaluating a plan to repatriate funds under the American Jobs Creation Act. If implemented to the maximum, it would result in repatriation of $684 million of dividends during 2005 with a tax cost of up to $70 million, which would be included in the company's second quarter results. The impact of this repatriation is not included in the company's guidance. ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
