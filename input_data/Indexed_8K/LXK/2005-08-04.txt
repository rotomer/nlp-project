ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE During the Company's second quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call held on Tuesday, July 26, 2005, in response to a question from an analyst, the Company stated that according to GfK data the European market for inkjet printers was down 18% year-to-year for the months of April and May 2005. Executive management of the Company has just confirmed that the statement was incorrect. GfK data actually reported a 1% increase in unit sales year-to-year for inkjet printers in the five major countries in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy) for the aggregate of the months of April and May 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. This filing shall serve as a correction of the unintentional error made in the statement by the Company on July 26, 2005. While the Company is citing data from GfK above, it should be noted that data available from industry analysts may vary widely among sources. The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
