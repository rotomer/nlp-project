Item 1.01.
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 31, 2005, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the accelerated vesting of certain unvested out-of-the-money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $80.00 per share. These options, which were previously awarded to its employees under the Companys equity compensation plans, would have otherwise vested in the years 2006 through 2008. The acceleration of vesting was effective for approximately
2.4
million unvested options, or
39
% of the Companys total outstanding unvested options. Options held by nonemployee directors and executive officers were not included in the vesting acceleration.
The acceleration of these options eliminates future compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its income statement with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment
(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is being adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2006. As a result of the acceleration, the Company expects to reduce its pre-tax stock option compensation expense by approximately $25 million over the course of the original vesting periods.
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to the estimated reduction in compensation expense required to be recognized under SFAS 123R and the accounting treatment for the acceleration. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements including, without limitation, the possibility that subsequent pronouncements or interpretations of SFAS 123R may alter the accounting treatment of stock options, as well as other risks described in the Companys most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on managements estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.
Item 8.01.
