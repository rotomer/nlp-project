Item 2.05.
 
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
As part of the companys ongoing optimization of its cost and expense structure, the company continually reviews its resources in light of a variety of factors. On January 24, 2006, the company determined that it would restructure its workforce, consolidate some manufacturing capacity, including the closure of one of its European facilities, and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans that are expected to save approximately $80 million per year in the aggregate. The workforce restructuring is expected to eliminate or transfer approximately 1,350 positions, with about 825 positions being eliminated, and approximately 525 positions being transferred from various locations primarily to low cost countries. The company plans to consolidate its manufacturing capacity to reduce manufacturing costs, including the closure of its Rosyth, Scotland inkjet cartridge manufacturing facility, and expects to reduce its operating expenses, particularly in the areas of supply chain, G&A and marketing and sales. The company also plans to freeze benefit accruals in its defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees, to be effective April 2006, and at the same time change from a maximum company matching contribution of three percent to an automatic company contribution of one percent and a maximum company matching contribution of five percent to the companys existing 401(k) plan. The company plans to make a maximum company matching contribution of six percent to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan on compensation amounts in excess of IRS qualified plan limits. The company expects that all of these changes in its operations will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $130 million, of which $80 million is cash. The pre-tax charges in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be approximately $50 million. The text of the press release announcing the workforce reduction and retirement plan changes is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01.
 
Other Events.
On January 20, 2006, the company received authorization from its Board of Directors to repurchase an additional $1 billion of its Class A Common Stock. This repurchase authorization raises the aggregate repurchase authorization to $3.9 billion from the $2.9 billion previously granted by the Board. The company has used approximately $2.57 billion of the prior authorization to repurchase approximately 55 million shares. The text of the press release announcing the additional repurchase authorization is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Lexmark announces fourth quarter and full year results
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
Jan 24
, 2006
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.37 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year, a decline of 12 percent. Earnings per share were $0.71 compared to $1.18 last year.
In the fourth quarter, year-over-year business segment revenue of $693 million was down 12 percent, and consumer segment revenue of $672 million was down 11 percent. Revenue in both segments was lower principally due to hardware price declines, lower hardware unit sales, and weak supplies sales.
Gross profit margin declined to 28.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 32.0 percent in the same period last year, mostly driven by lower product gross margins. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 20.0 percent versus 19.2 percent last year due to the decline in revenue outpacing the reduction in operating expenses.
Fourth-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $213 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million, and Lexmark repurchased $200 million of its stock during the quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was $331 million at quarter end. On January 20, 2006, the companys board of directors increased its share repurchase authorization by $1.0 billion, resulting in a total repurchase authorization of $1.3 billion.
The company also announced a restructuring plan today to improve its cost and expense structure. The restructuring actions will eliminate or transfer approximately 1,350 positions, with about 825 positions being eliminated, and approximately 525 positions being transferred from various locations worldwide primarily to low cost countries. This plan includes:
"Although our fourth quarter EPS results were better than expected, they were significantly below a year ago, reflecting a continuation of very challenging business conditions. While we are taking steps to improve our cost and expense structure, at the same time we are committed to maintaining our strategic investments in new product development and branding to strengthen our positioning in growth market segments in which we are currently underrepresented," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
New All-in-Ones strengthen companys SOHO position
As a result of the companys continued strategic focus on increasing its penetration in growth segments, Lexmark strengthened its position in the small office/home office market with the recent announcement of two new all-in-ones, the Lexmark X7350 and Lexmark X8350.
The Lexmark X7350 Office All-in-One printer announced earlier this month, affordably priced at under $150, demonstrates business-class performance as it leads this class of products with up to 25 pages per minute (ppm) black and 19 ppm color, and a 50 page automatic document feeder (ADF). Priced at under $200, the Lexmark X8350 Office All-in-One Plus Photo announced in November also offers full photo capabilities with its 2.4-inch color LCD, PictBridge, and photo card slots. Both the X7350 and X8350 are network capable, with optional Ethernet and wireless adapters.
Full Year 2005 Financial Results
Revenue for the full year ending December 31, 2005, was $5.22 billion, down 2 percent compared to the same period last year. Gross profit margin was 31.3 percent, compared to 33.7 percent a year ago. EPS were $2.91, down $1.37 year-over-year. EPS would have been $3.33 without the second quarter tax cost of $0.42 per share resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Looking forward
In the first quarter, the company expects revenue to decline in the high-single digit to low-double digit range year over year. It expects first quarter 2006 EPS to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70, excluding restructuring charges of approximately $0.33 per share, excluding a one-time curtailment gain of $0.06 per share, and including FAS123R options expenses of $0.06 per share. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.43. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2005 were $0.96.
