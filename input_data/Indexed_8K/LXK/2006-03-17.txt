Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 13, 2006, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) granted Long-Term Incentive Awards pursuant to the 2006-2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2006-2008 LTIP) under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan. The 2006-2008 LTIP is intended to reward the achievement of specific long-term objectives. Under this program, certain executives, including four of the Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)), are eligible for an award denominated in cash, but payable in cash, Class A Common Stock of the Company or a combination of the two, at the end of the three-year period based on the achievement of two objectives. The Compensation Committee has established operating income and market share as the performance measures for the 2006 through 2008 period. If the aggregate attainment based upon the two performance measures is below the Minimum level (30% of Target), the 2006-2008 LTIP will be funded at the Minimum level if the Companys return on invested capital is at or above the median average of the return on invested capital of the peer companies included in the S&P Technology Index (or, if such index is no longer available, another appropriate index as determined by the Compensation Committee). The Compensation Committee also may use negative discretion in determining any payment to participants under the 2006-2008 LTIP. The Minimum, Target and Maximum award amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers receiving an award is set forth in the following table.
The foregoing summary of the Companys 2006-2008 LTIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006-2008 LTIP Agreement and the Companys Stock Incentive Plan, pursuant to which the 2006-2008 LTIP awards were made.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
