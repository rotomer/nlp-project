LEXINGTON, K

July 25
, 2006
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2006. Second-quarter revenue was $1.23 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year, a decline of 4 percent. Second-quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and include FAS123(R) expense of $0.06 per share. Earnings per share would have been $1.07 excluding $0.35 per share restructuring related charges for actions announced in January, and excluding a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. Second-quarter 2005 earnings were $0.64, or $1.06 excluding the tax cost of $0.42 per share resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Earnings for the second quarter were significantly better than expected. While we have more work to do, we are making progress on our product, market and restructuring initiatives. Recent introductions of new color laser, monochrome laser and inkjet products strengthen our position in the key growth segments. In addition, we are generating solid cash flow while continuing to invest in R&D and initiatives to drive our long-term success, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Curlander.
Second-quarter business segment revenue of $713 million increased 1 percent year to year, and consumer segment revenue of $516 million declined 10 percent compared to a year ago. Second-quarter results include restructuring related pretax charges totaling $53 million including $16 million in cost of revenue, and $37 million in operating expense. Including these charges, gross profit margin was 34.0 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 25.6 percent and operating income margin was 8.4 percent.
Excluding restructuring related charges, gross profit margin would have been 35.3 percent in the second quarter, up from 34.6 percent in the same period last year. Operating expense as a percent of revenue excluding restructuring related charges would have been 22.6 percent in the second quarter, higher than 20.9 percent in the second quarter of 2005 due to the year-to-year revenue decline and increased FAS123(R) expense. Operating income margin excluding restructuring related charges would have been 12.8 percent in the second quarter. Operating income margin was 13.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
Second-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $142 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million. Lexmark repurchased $300 million of its
 
stock during the quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was about $730 million at quarter end.
New products, industry recognition demonstrate progress on strategic initiatives
Lexmark continues to make progress on its strategic initiatives.
 
First-half financials
Revenue for the first six months of 2006 was $2.50 billion, a decrease of 5 percent versus the same period in 2005. In the first half of 2006, gross profit margin was 32.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.9 percent, operating income margin was 8.9 percent, and EPS were $1.52. 2006 first-half results include restructuring related charges totaling $103 million, including $35 million in cost of revenue, and $68 million in operating expense. First-half operating expense also includes a $10 million pension curtailment benefit. First-half EPS includes a $2.5 million tax benefit from the second-quarter resolution of income tax matters.
Excluding restructuring and related charges, pension curtailment benefit, and the tax benefit, gross profit margin would have been 34.2 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio would have been 21.5 percent, operating income margin would have been 12.7 percent, and EPS would have been $2.10. In the first half of 2005, gross profit margin was 33.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 21.0 percent, and operating income margin was 12.8 percent. First-half 2005 EPS were $1.60, or $2.00 excluding a $53.1 million tax cost resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
In the first six months of 2006, the company generated $361 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested $93 million in capital expenditures, and repurchased $600 million of company stock.
Looking forward
In the third quarter, the company expects revenue to be flat to down in the low-single digit range year over year. It expects third-quarter 2006 EPS to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59. This includes restructuring related charges of approximately $0.16 per share. EPS excluding restructuring related charges in the third quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.75. EPS in the third quarter of 2005 were $0.59.
The company expects an inkjet component shortage, which is now largley resolved, will negatively impact third-quarter EPS by about $0.05 per share, primarily for incremental air freight to expedite product delivery. This is included in the guidance range.
