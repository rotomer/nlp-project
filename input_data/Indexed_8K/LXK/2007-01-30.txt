LEXINGTON, K

Jan. 30, 2007

Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.369 billion, about flat compared to revenue of $1.365 billion last year. Fourth-quarter earnings per share were $0.91 and include $0.06 per share for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 15.9 percent, primarily reflecting the retroactive extension of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit. Earnings per share would have been $1.05, excluding $0.14 per share restructuring-related charges for actions announced in January 2006. Fourth-quarter 2005 earnings per share were $0.71.
Overall, this was a good quarter for Lexmark and we believe we are on course with our strategy. We saw strong branded unit growth in the quarter in our targeted growth segments of low-end monochrome lasers, color lasers, laser all-in-ones, and inkjet all-in-ones. Our ongoing investments in product and brand development are better positioning us in these targeted segments, which are the engine for long-term growth, said Lexmark Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Curlander.
Fourth-quarter business segment revenue of $772 million grew 11 percent year to year, and consumer segment revenue of $597 million declined 11 percent compared to a year ago. Fourth-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was 30.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.3 percent, and operating income margin was 7.5 percent. These results include restructuring-related pretax charges totaling $19 million, comprised of $3 million in cost of revenue and $16 million in operating expense. Excluding restructuring-related charges:
Fourth-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $143 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $58 million. Lexmark repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its stock during the quarter for $141 million. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was about $460 million at quarter end.
Recent wins showcase strength of Lexmarks value proposition
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), The Childrens Hospital at Westmead, and Health First are among customers who have recently chosen Lexmark to help them print smarter, move information faster and more effectively, and better manage their printing environment.
Accolades for Lexmarks products continue
Lexmark is continuing to garner industry recognition for its innovative new products, the introduction of which has been supported by its increased level of investment in research and development. Lexmarks 2006 success in winning awards for its products is being featured in updated television advertising. The advertising highlights the fact that, last year, the top U.S. independent test labs awarded Lexmark more laser printer awards in its class than any other leading printer brand.
Among the recognition received during the fourth quarter, Lexmark received Fall Pick of the Year awards from Buyers Laboratory, Inc., for laser hardware and software solutions, including:
Lexmark also earned recognition for Best Hardware Solution across its line of products at CMP Medias 2006 XChange Tech Innovator Conference.
Also during the quarter, PC Magazine named the new Lexmark C534dn color laser printer as an Editors Choice.
In addition, Lexmarks new X5470 inkjet four-in-one was named as an International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Innovations 2007 Design and Engineering Awards honoree in the Mobile/Home Office Category.
Full-year results
2006 revenue was $5.108 billion, down 2 percent compared to revenue of $5.222 billion in 2005. 2006 business segment revenue grew 3 percent, and consumer segment revenue declined 8 percent.
2006 operating income of $443 million includes $41 million for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. Operating income would have been $568 million, excluding $135 million for restructuring-related charges and $10 million pension curtailment benefit for actions announced in January 2006. 2005 operating income was $534 million, or $544 million excluding 2005 workforce reduction charges.
2006 earnings per share were $3.27 and include $0.24 per share for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. Excluding $0.85 per share restructuring-related charges and pension curtailment benefit for actions announced in January 2006, earnings per share would have been $4.12. 2005 earnings per share were $2.91. 2005 EPS would have been $3.37 excluding $0.06 per share workforce reduction charges and the net tax cost of $0.40 per share primarily resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
2006 net cash provided by operating activities was $671 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $202 million. Lexmark repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of its stock during the year for $871 million.
Looking forward

It expects first-quarter 2007 EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. This includes restructuring-related charges of approximately $0.03 per share. EPS excluding restructuring-related charges in the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.93 to $1.03.
