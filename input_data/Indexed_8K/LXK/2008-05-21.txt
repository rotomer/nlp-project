Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 19, 2008, Lexmark International, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the offering and sale by the Company of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.900% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "notes due 2013") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.650% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "notes due 2018" and, together with the notes due 2013, the "Notes"). The offering of the Notes is expected to close on May 22, 2008.
The Notes will be issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, between the Company and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
The notes due 2013 will bear interest at a rate of 5.900% per year and the notes due 2018 will bear interest at a rate of 6.650% per year. Interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2008. The notes due 2013 and the notes due 2018 will mature on June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2018, respectively, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company. The Notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default and contains certain negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on assets, to incur indebtedness and to enter into sale-leaseback transactions.
The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the form of Indenture and form of First Supplemental Indenture, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
The offering of the Notes is registered as part of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-151002), which was filed on May 19, 2008. The documents filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 9.01 are being filed as exhibits to that Registration Statement.

     (c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.

and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The
Contribution
 
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability

     (f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies

Defaulting Underwriter
 
     (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     11. .

Annex A-1
     (-) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of this Agreement; each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein; and, to our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or, to the best knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the Commission.
     (-) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, and (c) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date, in each case as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act; and the Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
     (-) Each Transaction Document conforms in all material respects to the summary descriptions thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     (-) The descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus of statutes, legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects; the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus under the heading "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations", and incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus from Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the extent that they constitute summaries of matters of law or regulation or legal conclusions, fairly summarize the matters described therein in all material respects;
     (-) To the best knowledge of such counsel, (A) there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to
 
be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that have not been so filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     (-) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
     (-) The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
     Such counsel shall also state that they have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, representatives of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed. We have not participated in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, however, we have reviewed such documents. Although such counsel assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which such counsel need express no belief).
 
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Thompson Hine LLP described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.

     (-) Each of the Company and LITSA has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     (b) Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary for such series, its successors or their respective nominees. If at any time the Depositary for the
 
Securities of such series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be qualified to serve as the Depositary, the Company shall appoint a successor depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series of like tenor, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Securities or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of a series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Securities. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series of like tenor and terms, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. In addition, Physical Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security, if (i) the Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, or (B) ceases to be qualified to serve as Depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable, registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, or (iii) an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual notice has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue such Physical Securities.
     (c) Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the another Global Security will, upon such transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
     (d) In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of
 
this Section 3.08, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the Principal Amount of such Global Security in an amount equal to the Principal Amount of the beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Physical Securities of like tenor and amount.
     (e) In connection with the transfer of an entire Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal Principal Amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations.
     (f) The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series.

In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each of them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security of the same series, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
 
such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless from all risks, however remote, and, in every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, with respect to the holder of a substitute Security, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     Section 3.10. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities.
     Section 3.11. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities of such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities of such series without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions
Temporary Securities.
 
and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, and upon delivery to the Trustee of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities a like aggregate Principal Amount of definitive Securities of such series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
     Section 3.12. The Company in issuing the Securities of any series may use a "CUSIP" or "ISIN" number (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders of such series; provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers.
CUSIP and ISIN Numbers.
     Section 4.01. The Company, for the benefit of each series of the Securities, will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest on Securities.
     Section 4.02. The Company will maintain a Payment Office where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices, and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
 
initially appoints the Trustee at its office or agency as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
     Section 4.03. (a) If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
     (b) Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     (c) The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities (other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent will agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.03, that such Paying Agent will (i) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent; (ii) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Holders until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (iii) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series; and (iv) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, and upon the written request of that Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
 
     (d) The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent will be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     (e) Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, or interest has become due and payable will be paid to the Company upon a Company Request (or, if then held by the Company, will be discharged from such trust); and the Holder of such Security will thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 calendar days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
     Section 4.04. Subject to Article 10, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and rights (charter and statutory); provided, however, that the Company will not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Existence.
     Section 4.05. The Company covenants and agrees that, so long as any of the Securities shall be outstanding, neither it nor any Subsidiary will incur any Lien on property or assets owned on or acquired after the date of this Indenture to secure Debt without making, or causing such Subsidiary to make, effective provision for securing the Securities (and, if the Company may so determine, any other Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary that is not subordinated in right or payment to the Securities) (x) equally and ratably with such Debt as to such property or assets for as long as such Debt will be so secured or (y) in the event such Debt is subordinated in right of payment to
Limitation on Liens.

     (b) Liens in favor of only one or more of the Company and the Subsidiaries securing Debt of the Company to a Subsidiary or of a Subsidiary to the Company or to another Subsidiary;
     (c) any Lien on property of a Person existing immediately prior to the time such Person is merged with or into or consolidated with the Company or any Subsidiary or otherwise becomes a Subsidiary of the Company (provided that such Lien is not incurred in anticipation of such transaction and does not extend beyond the property subject thereto, or secure any Debt that is not secured thereby, immediately prior to such transaction);
     (d) any Lien on property existing immediately prior to the time of acquisition thereof (provided that such Lien is not incurred in anticipation of such acquisition and does not extend beyond the property subject thereto, or secure any Debt that is not secured thereby, immediately prior to such acquisition);
     (e) Liens to secure Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price of, or the cost of construction on or improvement of, the property subject to such Liens, provided, however, that (A) the principal amount of any Debt secured by such a Lien does not exceed 100% of such price or cost, (B) such Lien does not extend to or cover any other property other than such item of property and any improvements on such item and (C) such Lien must be created no later than 12 months after such purchase or the completion of such construction or installation of such improvements;

     (g) Liens to secure Debt incurred to extend, renew, refinance or refund (or successive extensions, renewals, refinancings or refundings), in whole or in part, Debt secured by any Lien referred to in the foregoing sub-clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) as long as such Lien does not extend to any other property and the Debt so secured is not increased except for increases in the amount of interest, premiums or fees and associated costs payable in connection with such extensions, renewals, refinancings or refunding.
 
     In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may, without equally and ratably securing the Securities, incur a Lien to secure Debt or enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of: (i) the amount of all Debt secured by all Liens incurred on or after the date of this Indenture and otherwise prohibited by this Indenture and (ii) the Attributable Value of all Sale and Leaseback Transactions entered into on or after the date of this Indenture and otherwise prohibited by this Indenture does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

Waiver of Certain Covenants.
 
condition, but no such waiver will extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision, or condition will remain in full force and effect.
     Section 5.01. Each of the following events constitutes an "" wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series:
Events of Default.
Event of Default
     (a) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at its Maturity; provided that failure by the Company to make such a payment shall not constitute an Event of Default if the Company makes such payment as required when it becomes due and payable; or
     (b) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; provided that failure by the Company to make such a payment shall not constitute an Event of Default if the Company makes such payment as required during such 30-day period; or
     (c) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section 5.01 specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, in the manner provided in Section 6.06, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

exceeding $50,000,000, in each case (i) and (ii) without such overdue or accelerated amount having been discharged, or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, within 30 days after written notice of such default has been given, in the manner provided in Section 6.06, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
     (e) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
     (f) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company, in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestration or other similar official of the Company, or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company, in furtherance of any such action.
     Section 5.02. (a) If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 5.01 hereof) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of the affected series to be due and payable immediately. Except as set forth above, upon such declaration the principal of, premium, if any, and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause
Acceleration.
 
(e) or (f) of Section 5.01 hereof occurs with respect to the Company the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without further action or notice on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
     (b) At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article 5 provided, the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.04. No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.03. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of such series or this Indenture.
Other Remedies.
     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
     Section 5.04. The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under this Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past default hereunder. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive
Waiver of Past Defaults.
 
any default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.05. With respect to the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee in good faith determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of that series or that may involve or cause the Trustee any potential liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction.
Control by Majority.
     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any such direction with respect to the Securities of such series, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for determining the Holders of outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such direction. The Holders of outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.
     Section 5.06. A Holder of any Security of any series may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of the applicable series only if:
Limitation on Suits.
     (a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
     (b) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to take action because of the Event of Default;
     (c) such Holder or Holders provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense in connection with the pursuance of such remedy;
     (d) during the 60-day period specified in (e) below, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request; and
 
     (e) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request and the offer of indemnity.
     A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
     Section 5.07. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
     Section 5.08. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, remaining unpaid on any Securities of such series and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof, including the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Collection Suit by Trustee.
     Section 5.09. The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
     Section 5.10. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
Priorities.
     First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 6.07, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
     Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities of any series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, respectively; and
     Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 5.10 upon five Business Days prior notice to the Company.
     Section 5.11. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of Securities of the affected series pursuant to Section 5.07 hereof, a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of Section 5.01, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate Principal Amount of all of the then outstanding Securities in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (e) or (f) of Section 5.01.
Undertaking for Costs.
     Section 5.12.

Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
 
Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding has been instituted.
     Section 5.13. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.09, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Section 5.14. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities of any series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     Section 6.01. The Trustee, with respect to the Securities of any series, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of such series which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties with respect to such series as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (and is continuing which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to such series, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default: Prior to Default.
     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, that:
provided
 
     (a) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee;
     (b) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
     (c) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     (d) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders given as provided in Section 5.05 or otherwise exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

     (b) reduce any amounts due on the Securities of such series or payable upon acceleration of the Maturity of the Securities of such series following an Event of Default;
     (c) adversely affect any right of repayment at the Holder's option if such option is applicable to the Securities of such series;

     (h) modify any of the provisions of this Section 9.02, Section 5.04 or Section 4.08, except to increase the percentage in Principal Amount of Securities the consent of whose Holders is required under any such Section or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby, , that this clause (h) will not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section 9.02, Section 5.04 and Section 4.08, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.11.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the Principal Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Principal Amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.

     If at any time the interest rate on the Notes of a series has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P, as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of that series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Notes of that series will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes of that series equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the applicable ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of any series to Baa3 or higher, and S&P increases its rating to BBB- or higher the interest rate on the Notes of that series will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rate on the Notes of each series will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the Notes of that series become rated A3 and A- or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency).
     Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate payable for the Notes of a series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes of a series exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance.
     If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes of that series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes of a series shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, the interest rate on the Notes of that series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
     If the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series is increased as described in this Section 2.02(d)(ii), then the term "interest", as used in this First Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes of the applicable series, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
 
     (e) . The currency of denomination of the Notes is United States Dollars. Payment of principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Notes will be made in United States Dollars.
Currency
     Section 2.03
. Optional Redemption.
     (a) The provisions of Article 11 of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
     (b) At any time and from time to time, the Notes of each series will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes of the applicable series, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of Principal Amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points for the Notes due 2013, or at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points for the Notes due 2018, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date for the applicable series of Notes.
     (c) On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes of either series, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of such series or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price. On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes of that series, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent, or the Trustee, funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Notes of a series to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed will be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided however that no Notes of a Principal Amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
     (d) Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes of the applicable series to be redeemed provided however that if the Trustee is asked to give such notice it shall be notified in writing of such request at least 15 days prior to the date of the giving of such notice. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
     Section 2.04
. Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.
     (a) If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes of a series, unless the Company shall have exercised its option to redeem the Notes of such series as described in Section 2.03 of this First Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "
Change of

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate Principal Amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased up to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the ""). With respect to the Notes of each series, within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of Notes of the applicable series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes of such series on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or, if the notice is mailed prior to the Change of Control, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date on which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurs (the "").

In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of the applicable series if
 
there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than an Event of Default arising as a result of a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
     (d) The Company shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of the applicable series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict.
