The Credit Agreement provides for a 3-year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility that includes the availability of swingline loans and multicurrency letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $300 million. Interest on all borrowings under the Credit Agreement is determined based upon several alternative interest rates, including a rate based on LIBOR.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including those relating to (a) a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA/consolidated interest expense) of not less than 4.0 to 1.0 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness/consolidated EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement limits, among other things, the Company's indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business.
The Credit Agreement includes usual and customary events of default (subject to applicable grace periods) for facilities of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments shall automatically terminate.
The Credit Agreement also includes collateral terms providing that in the event the Companys credit ratings decrease to certain levels the Company will be required to secure on behalf of the lenders first priority security interests in the Companys owned U.S. assets. Said collateral arrangements will be released upon the Company achieving certain defined improvements in its credit ratings.
As of the Effective Date, there are no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's current $300 million 5-year Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into on January 20, 2005, by the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Fleet National Bank and Citibank, N.A. as Co-Syndication Agents, Keybank National Association and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto (the "Terminated Credit

The Terminated Credit Agreement contained certain financial covenants, including those relating to the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.

If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due and, for any reason, the applicable Lender(s) are unable to make or have no obligation to make the ABR Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan (as applicable) contemplated in the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof.

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  If the Borrowers reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the

The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Replacement of the Issuing Bank
 
.

The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11.2.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the equivalent Borrowing.

Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

(ii)
 
the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)

(iv)
 
if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
(d)
 
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
29 
 
 
(e)
 
If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless (x) such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.11 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent an Interest Election Request requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Borrowing continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for the same or another Interest Period.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (and any such Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be redenominated in Dollars at the time of such conversion) at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

(e)
 
Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
                               (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., Local Time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in a Foreign Currency, 2:00 p.m., Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agents Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to euro, in euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7 Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agents Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and

except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the ) no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.

If at any time (i) insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder or (ii) any proceeds of Collateral are received by the Administrative Agent (A) not constituting a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrower) or (B) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, such funds shall be applied (subject to Section 5.09(h)) ratably , to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements including amounts then due to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank from the Borrower, , to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower, , to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans ratably, , to prepay principal on the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and any other amounts owing with respect to Banking Services Obligations and Swap Obligations ratably, , to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred three percent (103%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate amount of any unpaid LC Disbursements, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and , to the payment of any other Secured Obligation due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless a Default is in existence, none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall apply any payment which it receives to any Eurocurrency Loan of a Class, except (1) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurocurrency Loan or (2) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans of the same Class and, in any event, the Borrower shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16.  Subject to Section 5.09(h), the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Secured Obligations.

                                   (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall
 
37 
 
be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)
 
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.19.
 
.    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a)  
 
                               (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
 
38 
 
such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such  assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
 
.  At any time, the Borrower may request that the Aggregate Commitment be increased; that, after giving effect to any such increase, the Aggregate Commitment shall not exceed $300,000,000.  Such request shall be made in a written notice given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed effective date of such increase, which notice (a ) shall specify the amount of the proposed increase in the Aggregate Commitment and the proposed effective date of such increase.  The Borrower may notify the Administrative Agent of any financial institution that shall have agreed to become a Lender party hereto (a ) in connection with the Commitment Increase Notice and any Proposed New Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders on or before the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed effective date of the amount of each Lenders and Proposed New Lenders Commitment (the ) and the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, which amount shall be effective on the following Business Day.  Any increase in the Aggregate Commitment shall be subject to the following conditions precedent: (A) as of the date of the Commitment Increase Notice and as of the proposed effective date of the increase in the Aggregate Commitment, all representations and warranties under Article III shall be true and correct in all material respects as though made on such date (except for representations and warranties for which exceptions thereto have been disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and which have been approved in writing by the Required Lenders or expressly relate to an earlier specified date) and no event shall have occurred and then be continuing which constitutes a Default or Event of Default, (B) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Proposed New Lender or Lender that shall have agreed to provide a Commitment in support of such increase in the Aggregate Commitment shall have executed and delivered a Commitment and Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, (C) to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, counsel for the Borrower shall have provided to the Administrative Agent supplemental opinions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (D) the Borrower and the Proposed New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments and documents as may be required under Article IV or that the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested in connection with such increase and (E) the Administrative Agent shall have administered the reallocation of the Revolving Credit Exposures on the effective date of such increase ratably among the Lenders (including new Lenders) after giving effect to such increase.  The Borrower hereby agrees to compensate each Lender for all losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by such Lender, if any, in connection with the sale and assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan hereunder on the terms and in the manner as set forth in Section 2.16 hereof. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to any increase in the Aggregate Commitment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Borrower and each Lender of the effective date of such increase.  Upon the effective date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment that is supported by a Proposed New Lender, such Proposed New Lender shall be a party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall have the

.  Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article II and Article IV with respect to any Credit Event to be effected in any Foreign Currency, if (i) there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Credit Event any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank (if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit) or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Borrowings or Letters of Credit comprising such Credit Event to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrower or (ii) an Equivalent Amount of such currency is not readily calculable, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower, the Lenders and, if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank at least (to the extent practicable) two Business Days prior to such Credit Event, and such Credit Events shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.07, be made on the date of such Credit Event in Dollars, (a) if such Credit Event is a Borrowing, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be, as ABR Loans, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be or (b) if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit, in a face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the face amount specified in the related request or application for such Letter of Credit, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to request the issuance of such Letter of Credit on such date or (ii) it elects to have such Letter of Credit issued on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Letter of Credit would in the reasonable opinion of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in a face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the face amount specified in the related request or application for such Letter of Credit, as the case may be.

.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the ) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agents main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a

.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
 
(a)
 
fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12;
 
(b)
 
the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;
provided
 
(c)
 
if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)
 
all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
 
(ii)
 
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) , cash collateralize such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

(iii)
 
if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.23(c), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv)
 
if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.23(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; or
 
(v)
 
if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.23(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and

SECTION 2.24.

SECTION 2.25.
 
.  If at any time the Credit Default Swap Spread is unavailable, (i) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of such unavailability and (ii) the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith (for a period of up to thirty (30) days after the Credit Default Swap Spread becomes unavailable (such thirty-day period , the )) to agree on an alternative method for establishing the Applicable LIBOR Rate. The Applicable LIBOR Rate at any date of determination thereof in accordance with the provisions of the definition of Applicable LIBOR Rate which falls during the Negotiation Period shall be based upon the then most recently available quote of the Credit Default Swap Spread prior to such unavailability.  If no such alternative method is agreed upon during the Negotiation Period, the Applicable LIBOR Rate at any date of determination subsequent to the end of the Negotiation Period shall be a rate per annum equal to the Applicable LIBOR Rate Cap until such earlier date as (i) the Administrative Agent informs the Borrower and the Lenders that the Credit Default Swap Spread is once again available or (ii) the Borrower and the Lenders agree upon on an alternative method for establishing the Applicable LIBOR Rate.

On December 30, 2002 (02 action) and March 16, 2004 (04 action), Lexmark International, Inc. (filed claims against Static Control Components, Inc. (SCC) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (the District Court) alleging violation of Lexmarks intellectual property and state law rights.  Similar claims in a separate action were filed by Lexmark in the District Court against David Abraham and Clarity Imaging Technologies, Inc. (Clarity) on October 8, 2004.  SCC and Clarity have filed counterclaims against Lexmark in the District Court alleging that Lexmark engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws.  SCC has stated in its legal documents that it is seeking approximately $17.8 million to $19.5 million in damages for Lexmarks alleged anticompetitive conduct and approximately $1 billion for Lexmarks alleged violation of the Lanham Act.  Clarity has not stated a damage dollar amount.  SCC and Clarity are seeking treble damages, attorney fees, costs and injunctive relief.  On September 28, 2006, the District Court dismissed the counterclaims filed by SCC alleging that Lexmark engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws.  On October 13, 2006, SCC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the District Courts Order dismissing SCCs claims, or in the alternative, to amend its pleadings, which the District Court denied on June 1, 2007.  On October 13, 2006, the District Court issued an order to stay the action brought against David Abraham and Clarity until a final judgment or settlement is entered into in the consolidated 02 and 04 actions.  On June 20, 2007, the District Court Judge ruled that SCC directly infringed one of Lexmarks patents-in-suit.  On June 22, 2007, the jury returned a verdict that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmarks patents-in-suit. As to SCCs defense that Lexmark has committed patent misuse, in an advisory, non-binding capacity, the jury did find some company conduct constituted misuse.  In the jurys advisory, non-binding findings, the jury also found that the relevant market was the cartridge market rather than the printer market and that Lexmark had unreasonably restrained competition in that market.  On October 3, 2008, the District Court Judge issued a memorandum opinion denying various motions made by Lexmark that sought to reverse the jurys finding that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmarks patents-in-suit.  The District Court Judge did, however, grant Lexmarks motion that SCCs equitable defenses, including patent misuse, were moot.  As a result, the jurys advisory findings on misuse, including the jurys finding that the relevant market was the cartridge market rather than the printer market and that Lexmark had unreasonably restrained competition in that market, were not adopted by the District Court.  On March 31, 2009, the District Court granted SCCs Motion for Reconsideration of an earlier Order that had found Lexmarks terms used on certain supply items that provide for an up-front discount in exchange for an agreement to use the supply item only once were supported by patent law.  The District Court Judge ruled that after the U.S. Supreme Courts most recent statement of the law regarding patent exhaustion, Lexmark may not invoke patent law to enforce these terms but state contract law may still be invoked.  A final judgment for the 02 action and the 04 action has not yet been entered by the District Court.
 
 
 
Copyright fees
Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and/or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have taken action to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content.  Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices.  The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country.  Lexmark has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the risks related to the copyright fee issues currently pending.  The financial impact on Lexmark, which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes, Lexmarks and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and Lexmarks ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon competitive market conditions, remains uncertain.  As of June 30, 2009, Lexmark has accrued approximately $67 million for pending copyright fee issues, including litigation proceedings, local legislative initiatives and/or negotiations with the parties involved.  The remaining balance accrued for copyright fees relates to amounts Lexmark has agreed to pay to various parties, including a recent settlement that is discussed further below.
As of June 30, 2009, approximately $56 million of the $67 million accrued for the pending copyright fee issues was related to single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007.  On December 6, 2007, the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal Supreme Court) issued a judgment in litigation brought by VerwertungsGesellschaft Wort (VG Wort), a collection society representing certain copyright holders, against Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), finding that single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007 were not subject to the law authorizing the German copyright fee levy (German Federal Supreme Court, file reference I ZR 94/05).  Lexmark and VG Wort entered into an agreement pursuant to which both VG Wort and Lexmark agreed to be bound by the outcome of the VG Wort/HP litigation.  VG Wort filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, the Constitutional Court) challenging the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court.  Lexmark believes the amount accrued represents its best estimate of the copyright fee issues currently pending.

Credit Agreement
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the extensions of credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that each of the Guarantors (constituting all of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower required to execute this Guaranty pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement) execute and deliver this Guaranty, whereby each of the Guarantors shall guarantee the payment when due of all Obligations; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
SECTION 1.  .  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined herein have, as used herein, the respective meanings provided for therein.
Definitions
SECTION 2.  .  Each of the Guarantors represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been renewed at the time of the making, conversion or continuation of any Loan or issuance of any Letter of Credit) that:
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
(A)  It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
 
 
 
(B)  The Transactions applicable to it are within such Guarantors organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational actions and, if required, actions by equity holders.

In addition to the foregoing, each of the Guarantors covenants that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any amount payable under the Credit Agreement or any other Guaranteed Obligations shall remain unpaid, it will, and, if necessary, will enable the Borrower to, fully comply with those covenants and agreements of the Borrower applicable to such Guarantor set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Should any Guarantor have the right, notwithstanding the foregoing, to exercise its subrogation rights, each Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably (A) subordinates any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off that such Guarantor may have to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and (B) to the extent permitted by law, waives any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Guaranty, and that the Administrative Agent, the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this Section 7(A).
              (B)  Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights, if any, of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets.

If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an ), any

If any such Guarantor fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same.  Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than the contingent indemnity obligations) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor.
