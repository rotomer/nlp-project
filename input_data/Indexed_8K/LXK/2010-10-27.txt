Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Appointment of Certain Officers and Director
On October 21, 2010, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) appointed Paul A. Rooke, age 52, as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to succeed Paul J. Curlander and appointed Dr. Curlander, age 57, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Chairman, effective on October 26, 2010 (the Effective Date).
The Board also approved the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of the Board that on the Effective Date the size of the Board be increased from eleven to twelve directors; that Mr. Rooke be elected to the Board as a Class II Director with a term expiring at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and, that Mr. Rooke be appointed to serve on the Executive Committee of the Board.  Mr. Rooke will not receive any compensation for his service as a director.  There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Rooke and any other person pursuant to which he was selected as a director.
Dr. Curlander will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.  Dr. Curlander plans on retiring from the Board and as Executive Chairman of the Company, effective April 30, 2011.  As the Executive Chairman, Dr. Curlander will remain an officer for purposes of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and therefore subject to the filing requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
These management changes are the result of a planned management succession process.
Mr. Rooke has been with the Company since its formation and has served as the executive vice president and president of the Companys Imaging Solutions Division since July 2007.  From 2002 to July 2007, Mr. Rooke served as executive vice president and president of the Companys Printing Solutions and Services Division.
Dr. Curlander has been with the Company since its formation and for over the last twelve years he served as the Companys Chief Executive Officer.
There are no transactions involving the Company and Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander that the Company would be required to be report pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  There are no family relationships between Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander with any other executive officers of the Company or members of the Board.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
In connection with the appointment of Mr. Rooke to his position as President and Chief Executive Officer, the Board approved the recommendation of the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board to increase Mr. Rookes annual base salary from $570,000 to $800,000, as of the Effective Date.  Subject to the maximum award amount of six-tenths of one percent of
 
 
 
 
operating income as set forth in the Companys Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan as approved by the Stockholders of the Company, Mr. Rookes maximum annual incentive compensation opportunity (expressed as a percentage of his annual base salary) was increased from 175% to 200% as of the Effective Date.  His minimum annual incentive compensation opportunity of 30% of his annual base salary and his target annual incentive compensation of 100% of his annual base salary were not changed.
The Board has also granted Mr. Rooke a long-term incentive award comprised of 22,000 restricted stock units and 60,000 stock options, as of the Effective Date and pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan as approved by the Stockholders of the Company.  The restricted stock units will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on the second through fourth anniversaries of the Effective Date.  The stock options, with an exercise price of $37.71, the closing price of the stock on October 26, 2010, shall become vested and exercisable in four equal installments (25% per year) on each of the 1 through 4 anniversaries of the Effective Date.  The stock options shall expire on October 26, 2020, if not sooner forfeited or exercised.  The restricted stock unit and stock option awards are subject to Mr. Rookes continued employment with the Company from the Effective Date until the relevant vesting date.
st
th
Other than as indicated herein, the compensation arrangements for Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander remain the same.
On the Effective Date, the Company entered into a new form of Employment Agreement and a new form of Change in Control Agreement (CIC Agreement) with each of Dr. Curlander and Mr. Rooke.
The new form of Employment Agreement was prepared to replace their employment agreements which were scheduled to expire on October 31, 2010. The Employment Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on October 31, 2012 for Mr. Rooke and April 30, 2011 for Dr. Curlander.  In each case, the executive officers employment shall continue thereafter at will. The Employment Agreement provides for certain additional payments beyond the term of employment if the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the executive officer for good reason, or as a result of the executive officers death or disability. These potential payments are substantially the same as provided in the p redecessor agreements they replace. The new form of Employment Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
In the interest of complying with best pay practices, the Company and each of Dr. Curlander and Mr. Rooke agreed to a new form of CIC Agreement that eliminates the excise tax gross up provisions set forth in their predecessor agreements.  Under the predecessor agreements, if any excise tax was imposed because payments under the agreement resulted in excess parachute payments, the executive officer would receive a gross-up payment that would result in the payment of any such taxes and any additional excise taxes imposed on the gross-up payment.  For Mr. Rooke, the new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on October 26, 2012, provided however, that commencing on October 26, 2011 and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC
 
 
 
 
Agreement shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date.  For Dr. Curlander, the new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on April 30, 2011, provided, however, that commencing on March 31, 2011, and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC Agreement shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date. The CIC Agreement also provides that if the executive voluntarily terminates employment the CIC Agreement will terminate without any further obligations to executive other than for certain accrued obligations. The CIC Agreement generally provides for certain payments to each executive officer if, within 12 months prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreemen t), the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, or within 24 months after a Change in Control, the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company or by the executive officer under certain circumstances. In the event of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer would receive his base salary and pro rata annual bonus through the date of termination. In addition, the executive officer would receive three times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation. The CIC Agreement also provides for the continuation of welfare benefits for a period of three years. Under the new form of CIC Agreement, if any payments under the agreement trigger the excise tax, then the executive officers payments shall be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax if the net after - -tax benefit of such reduction exceeds the net after-tax benefit if such reduction is not made.  The new form of CIC Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and CIC Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of Employment Agreement for Executive Officers and form of CIC Agreement for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, and incorporated herein by reference.

A copy of the press release issued by the Company on October 26, 2010 announcing the officer appointments and the election of Mr. Rooke as a director is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of <Date of Agreement>, between Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Fayette County, Kentucky (the "Employer"), and <Name of Employee> (the "Employee").
WHEREAS, the Employer and the Employee desire to enter into an employment agreement and terminate the Employment Agreement entered into by the parties on <Date of Prior Agreement>, each thereby relinquishing all rights and benefits and terminating all duties and obligation of each party thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1.           .
Term; Position and Responsibilities
(a)           .  Unless the Employee's employment shall sooner terminate pursuant to Section 6, the Employer shall employ the Employee for a term commencing on the day hereof and ending on <Date of Termination> (the "Term") and the Employee's employment shall continue thereafter at will.
Term of Employment
(b)           .  The Employee will serve as <Employee Title> and in such other executive capacity or capacities as may be determined from time to time by or under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Employer ("Employer's Board"), and the Employee will devote all of his skill, knowledge and working time (except for reasonable vacation time and absence for sickness or similar disability) to the conscientious performance of his duties.  The Employee acknowledges that, as a result of his position with the Employer, he has responsibility for the operation and worldwide competitive positioning of the Employer and for ensuring that the Employer remains a lead ing developer, manufacturer and supplier of printers, multifunctional devices and associated supplies, services and solutions on a worldwide basis.  The Employee represents that he is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and that his employment hereunder and compliance by him with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not conflict with or result in the breach of any agreement to which he is a party or by which he may be bound.
Position and Responsibilities
2.           .  As compensation for the services to be performed by the Employee hereunder, the Employer will pay the Employee an annual base salary of <Annual Salary> during the term of his employment hereunder.  The Employer will review the Employees base salary from time to time during the period of his employment hereunder and, in the unfettered discretion of the Employer, may increase
Base Salary
 
 
 
 
such base salary from time to time based upon the performance of the Employee, the financial condition of the Employer, prevailing industry salary scales and such other factors as the Employer shall consider relevant.  (The annual base salary payable to the Employee under this Section 2, as the same may be increased from time to time, shall hereinafter be referred to as the Base Salary.)  The Base Salary payable under this Section 2 shall be reduced to the extent that the Employee elects to defer such Base Salary under the terms of any deferred compensation or savings plan maintained or established by the Employer, provided that any such reduction of the Base Salary shall not be taken into account for purposes of calculating the Annual Bonus (as defined in Section 3).  The Employer shall pay the Employee the Base Salary in biweekly installments, or in such other installments as may be mutually agreed upon by the Employer and the Employee.
3.

The Annual Bonus shall be determined by the Employer based on annual objectives established by the Employer and approved by the Compensation and Pension Committee of Employers Board (the Annual Objectives).  If all Annual Objectives are achieved, the Annual Bonus shall be <target percentage> of the Employees Base Salary paid to the Employee during each calendar year during the term of the Employee's employment hereunder (the Target Bonus).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employer may increase or decrease the amount of the Annual Bonus (including providing no bonus) based upon the Employers judgment of Employees overall contribution to the Employers business results.  In any event, the Employees Annual Bonus shall not exceed the Maximum Award as set forth in the SEICP.  To the extent that the Employee is a participant in the SEICP at the relevant time, the terms of the SEICP, as amended from time to time, are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.

(h)           .  The Employer's obligation to make any payments hereunder shall be conditioned upon the Employees continued compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Employer's receipt of an appropriately signed "General Release and Covenant Not to Sue" in form and substance satisfactory to the Employer.

engaged in such business without first obtaining written approval from the Employer, that the Employee's ownership of less than 1% of the issued and outstanding stock of any corporation whose stock is traded on an established securities market shall not constitute competition with the Employer.  The Employer may grant or deny such approval in its sole discretion.
provided
9.           .  During the period of the Employee's employment and thereafter for a period equal to the number of months providing the basis for calculating any termination payments to the Employee under Section 6, if any such payments are required, but in any event for at least 36 months from the Date of Termination, the Employee, regardless of whether such termination is at the insistence of the Employer or the Employee, shall not, directly or indirectly, for his own account or the account of any other person or entity: (a) disparage, criticize, or otherwise make any derogatory statements regarding the products and services of the Employer or its subsidiaries or Employers Board, officers or employees; (b) solicit, recruit, induce, employ or hire, or attempt to solicit, recruit, induce, employ or hire, directly or by assisting others (including, but not limited to, any new employer, any employee of the Employer or its subsidiaries, or any former employee of the Employer or its subsidiaries who within six months of that time has been employed by the Employer or its subsidiaries) any person or entity who or which is at the time, or within six months of that time has been, employed by or otherwise engaged to perform services for the Employer or its subsidiaries; or (c) solicit, interfere with, or otherwise entice or attempt to entice away any person or entity who or which is a customer or prospective customer of the Employer or its subsidiaries (including a person or entity who or which is a customer or prospective customer by either direct contract or relationship with the Employer or its subsidiaries or who or which has purchased, leased, o r otherwise acquired the Employers or its subsidiaries products or service from the Employers or its subsidiaries distributors, parties for whom Employer is an original equipment manufacturer, dealers or resellers), a supplier to the Employer or its subsidiaries, or has, within the previous 36 months, been a customer of or supplier to the Employer or its subsidiaries.

10.           .  In the event of the termination of the Employee's employment for any reason, the Employee will deliver to the Employer all memoranda, notes, records, drawings, manuals, or other documents, and all copies thereof including any electronic information (e.g., e-mails and spreadsheets) or copies, that are in the possession of the Employee, whether made or compiled by the Employee or furnished to the Employee by the Employer.
Return of Documents

Forfeiture.
(a)             If the Employee violates any provision of Sections 7, 8, 9 or 10 of this Agreement, and the Employee is no longer employed by the Employer or its subsidiaries, whether or not the termination of employment occurs prior to or subsequent to such violation, then (1) all stock incentive awards, including but not
Forfeiture of Realized and Unrealized Gains on Incentive Awards for Breach of this Agreement.

limited to stock options, restricted stock awards and any deferred stock units, held by the Employee shall terminate effective as of the date on which the Employee violates this Agreement, unless terminated sooner by operation of another term or condition of the Employees stock incentive award agreement or the plan pursuant to which such award has been issued, and (2) any gain realized by the Employee on the vesting of restricted stock or deferred stock units, and option gains (represented by the closing market price on the date of exercise over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of options exercised without regard to any subsequent market price decrease or increase) realized by the Employee from exercising all or a portion of the Employees options, within 18 months preceding the earlier of (a) the violation of Section 7, 8, 9, or 10 and (b) the Employees Date of Termination; and through the later of (c) 18 months following the violation of Section 7, 8, 9, or 10 and (d) such period of time as it takes the Employer to discover such violation, shall be paid promptly by the Employee to the Employer.  The Employee agrees that the Employer has the right to withhold the amount owed to it from any amounts that the Employer may owe the Employee from time to time (including, but not limited to, wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay); provided, however, if any amounts that the Employer is required to pay to the Employee are subject to Code Section 409A, any such withholding by the Employer from those amounts shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent applicable thereto.  The Employee and the Employer agree that this forfeiture provision does not waive any other rights at law that the Employer may have, including but not limited to, equitable rights which would includ e injunctive relief.
(b)           .  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that he is subject to the terms and conditions of the Employers Executive Compensation Recovery Policy (including any successor policy that may be adopted by the Employer to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Rules promulgated thereunder), and that all or any portion of the Employees Annual Bonus, other incentive compensation, and equity compensation may be subject to forfeiture and previously paid amounts may be subject to recovery by the Employer in accordance with the Executive Compensation Recovery Policy.
Forfeiture under the Employers Executive Compensation Recovery Policy
12.           .  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement (as well as each subsection of such Sections) shall be construed as agreements independent of each other and of any provision of this or any other contract between the parties hereto, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by the Employee against the Employer, whether predicated upon this or any other contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of said covenants.  The Employee further agrees that the term of the covenants cont ained in Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement (as well as each subsection of such Sections) and the geographic limitations are reasonable limits within the context of the Employees current or former activities for the Employer.  The Employee therefore waives any defense to enforcement of these covenants on the grounds that these covenants are not valid or that the terms of these covenants are not reasonable, but the
Waiver of Defenses; Enforceability of Covenants
 
 
8
 
Employee expressly does not waive the right to seek a construction of the covenants themselves.
