On November 1, 2010, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) entered into a new form of Employment Agreement and a new form of Change in Control Agreement (CIC Agreement) with, among other executive officers, each of John W. Gamble, Jr., the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martin S. Canning, Executive Vice President and President of Imaging Solutions and Services, and Ronaldo M. Foresti, Vice President of Asia Pacific and Latin America, each a named executive officer of the Company.
The new form of Employment Agreement was prepared to replace each executive officers employment agreement that expired on October 31, 2010. The Employment Agreement provides for a term commencing on November 1, 2010 and ending on October 31, 2012. In each case, the executive officers employment shall continue thereafter at will. The Employment Agreement provides for certain additional payments beyond the term of employment if the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the executive officer for good reason, or as a result of the executive officers death or disability. These potential payments are substantially the same as provided in the predecessor agreements they replace. The new form of Employment Agreement otherwise includes covenants and c onditions typically included in such agreements.
In the interest of complying with best pay practices, the Company and each of the executive officers agreed to a new form of CIC Agreement that eliminates the excise tax gross up provisions set forth in the predecessor agreements.  Under the predecessor agreements, if any excise tax was imposed because payments under the agreement resulted in excess parachute payments, the executive officer would receive a gross-up payment that would result in the payment of any such taxes and any additional excise taxes imposed on the gross-up payment.  The new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on November 1, 2010 and ending on October 31, 2012, provided however, that commencing on November 1, 2011 and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC Agreement shall be automaticall y extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date.  The CIC Agreement generally provides for certain payments to each of the executive officers if, within 12 months prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreement), the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, or within 24 months after a Change in Control, the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company or by the executive officer under certain circumstances. In the event of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer would receive his base salary and pro rata annual bonus through the date of termination. In addition, in the case of Messrs. Gamble and Canning, the executive officer would receive three times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation, and in the case of Mr. Foresti, two times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation. The CIC Agreement also provides for the continuation of welfare benefits for a period of three years in the case of Messrs. Gamble and Canning, and for a period of two years in the case of Mr. Foresti. Under the new form of CIC Agreement, if any payments under the agreement trigger the excise tax, then the executive
 
 
 
 
officers payments shall be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax if the net after-tax benefit of such reduction exceeds the net after-tax benefit if such reduction is not made.  The new form of CIC Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and CIC Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of Employment Agreement for Executive Officers, the form of CIC Agreement for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents, and the form of CIC Agreement for Vice Presidents, which are filed hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company.

In consideration of the rights and benefits accruing to each party under this Agreement, the Company and the Executive hereby agree to terminate the Change in Control Agreement entered into by the parties on November 1, 2008, each thereby relinquishing all rights and benefits and terminating the duties and obligations pursuant to such agreement.
