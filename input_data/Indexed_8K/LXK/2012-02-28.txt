2012 Incentive Compensation Award Opportunities for Named Executive Officers
On February 22, 2012, the Compensation and Pension Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) granted annual incentive compensation award opportunities with respect to the 2012 calendar year (the IC Performance Period) to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Senior Executive IC Plan). The maximum award which may be earned under the Senior Executive IC Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of Operating Income (as defined in the Senior Executive IC Plan) for the IC Performance Period. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a Named Executive Officer based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives established under the Companys 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (2012 IC Plan).
Under the 2012 IC Plan, the Compensation Committee has established a Traditional Plan and a Threshold Plan, and the award amount is based on the greater of the Traditional Plan or the Threshold Plan, subject to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan.  Under the Traditional Plan, corporate performance measures include core revenue, operating income, cash cycle days and individual performance.  Under the Traditional Plan, business or geographic unit performance measures include business unit or geographic unit core revenue, operating income, and cash cycle days.  Under the Threshold Plan, the performance measure is worldwide free cash flow.  Each of the performance measures include restructuring charges, but exclude acquisition related adjustment, and any 2012 acquisition activity.  The minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2012 IC Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan, are set forth in the following table.
 
 
 
2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Opportunities for the Named Executive Officers
Also on February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Rooke, a 2012-2014 long-term incentive award opportunity comprised as follows: a cash-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP) award representing 35% of the award opportunity; performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs) representing 35% of the award opportunity and time-based RSUs representing 30% of the award opportunity. Mr. Rookes 2012-2014 long-term incentive award opportunity, excludes time-based RSUs, and is comprised 50% of performance-based RSUs and 50% of a cash-based LTIP award.
The performance measure for the performance-based RSUs is the Companys relative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measured against the ROIC of companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the period commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2014 (the Performance Period). The performance-based RSUs to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2015, and if earned will be settled on February 24, 2015. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the Performance Period to earn the performance-based RSUs.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement ("disability" and "retirement," each as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) during the Performance Period, a prorated portion of the performance-based RSUs may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the performed period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate on February 24, 2015.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining whether performance-based RSUs shall be earned by a Named Executive Officer applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The time-based RSU awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2013, February 24, 2014 and February 24, 2015, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date. The time-based RSUs awarded, as well as the minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based RSU awards are set forth in the following table.
The cash-based long-term incentive award opportunities were granted pursuant to the 2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2012-2014 LTIP").  The performance measure for the 2012
 
 
 
2014 LTIP is the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against the TSR of companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period.  Under the 2012-2014 LTIP, each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive a cash award at the end of the Performance Period based on the Companys TSR rank measured against the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index.  The Compensation Committee will make this determination in 2015, and if earned, the cash payout will occur prior to March 15, 2015.
The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the Performance Period to earn an LTIP payout.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement ("disability" and "retirement," each as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) during the Performance Period, a prorated portion of the award may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the Performance Period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate prior to March 15, 2015.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining any payout to an executive under the 2012-2014 LTIP applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2012-2014 LTIP for each of the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2011 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2012.

"Participant"
This Agreement is only a summary of the principal terms governing the LTIP.  The LTIP is subject in all respects to the terms of the Lexmark International, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the ). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.  It is important that the Participant read and understand the Plan and not rely solely on the brief description that follows.  All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Plan
Overview
The LTIP is designed to reward the achievement of a specific performance measure over a three-year period.  The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the ) established the Performance Measure, as defined below, for the performance period beginning January 1, 20XX and ending December 31, 20XX (the ).
Committee
Performance Period
Depending upon the Company's attainment of the Performance Measure, the Participant may be eligible to receive a payment under the LTIP, as set forth below.
Performance Measure
The Committee has established the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return () measured against the average TSR of the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index as the performance measure for the Performance Period (the ).  The calculation of TSR for the Company and for the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index, will reflect the appreciation (depreciation) in the average closing stock prices of the Company and the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the 60-day period ending December 31, 20XX (the ) and the average closing stock prices for the 60-day period ending December 31, 20XX (the ), assuming that any dividends paid are reinvested on the date such amounts are paid to their respective shareholders.

Target Opportunity
The LTIP awards are denominated in cash, but in the Committees sole discretion may be paid in cash, the Companys Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and the Companys Class A Common Stock. For the Performance Period, your target award is [INSERT TARGET] ().
Target
The chart below illustrates how the LTIP awards will be calculated.
 
 
 
 
 
between the corresponding LTIP payment amounts, set forth above.  For example, if the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period is at the 45 percentile, the Participant shall be eligible to receive an LTIP payment equal to 75% of the Participants Target, subject to reduction in the Committees sole discretion.
th
Committee Discretion
The Committee may use its sole discretion in determining the amount of any payment, or no payment, to Participants under the LTIP and whether to reduce (but not increase) the amount of any payment based on any factors it deems appropriate.
Payout Timing
The Committee intends to review and approve the attainment of the Performance Measure following the end of the three-year Performance Period.  This review is expected to occur in a 20XX Committee meeting.  Payments will be made only after the Committee approval has occurred, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 20XX.
Separation from Service
Except in the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of the Participant during the Performance Period, the Participant must be employed at the end of the Performance Period (December 31, 20XX) to be eligible to receive a payout.  If the Participant should have a separation from service (as defined below) due to death, Disability or Retirement during the Performance Period, the payout, if any, is achieved based on the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P 500 Technology Index as of the end of the Performance Period, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the separation from service due to death Disability or Retirement divided by 36, and will be made only after Committee approval has occurred after the end of Performance Period, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 20XX.  For purposes of the LTIP, separation from service shall mean a separation from service from the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of Code Section 409A, using the default provisions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations, or any successor regulation thereto.
Change in Control
In the event of a Change in Control during the Performance Period, the Participant shall be entitled to a payout, as soon as practicable after the Change in Control, equal to the greater of Target or the actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P 500 Technology Index as of the date of the Change in Control, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control divided by 36.  If a Change in Control occurs after the Performance Period ends, but prior to the date of payment, the Participants payout, if any, shall be based on actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period.
Forfeiture of the Award
The Participant acknowledges that this opportunity for a long-term incentive award has been granted as an incentive to the Participant to remain employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to exert his or her best efforts to enhance the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries over the long-term. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that if he or she (a) within 12 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, accepts employment with a competitor of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise engages in competition with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (b) within 36 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, disrupts, damages, interferes or otherwise acts against the interests of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, recruiting, soliciting or employing, or encouraging or assisting the Participant's new employer or any other person or entity to recruit, solicit or employ, any employee of

the Company or one of its Subsidiaries without the Company's prior written consent, which may withheld in its sole discretion, or (c) within 36 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, disparages, criticizes, or otherwise makes any derogatory statements regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their directors, officers or employees, or (d) discloses or otherwise uses confidential information or material of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, each of these constituting a harmful action, then the Participant shall immediately repay to the Company the full amount of the award received under the terms and conditions of the LTIP.  The Committee shall have the right not to enforce the provisions of this paragraph with respect to the Participant.
Participant agrees to be fully liable for any remedies available at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, for any breach of this above described covenant, promise and agreement.  Participant agrees to reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing the obligations of Participant.  This entire provision shall survive the termination of the Agreement and, in no manner, shall the remedies described herein be considered as the Companys exclusive or entire remedy for Participants breach, non-compliance or violation of this Agreement or any other agreement that Participant may have entered into with the Company.
Tax Withholding
In the event that the payout of the award is made in Class A Common Stock of the Company, delivery of such stock shall not be made unless and until the Participant, or, if applicable, the Participants beneficiary or estate, has made appropriate arrangements for the payment to the Company of an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding or other tax requirements, as determined by the Company.  To satisfy the Participants applicable withholding and other tax requirements, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold a number of shares of Class A Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the payout date equal to the applicable amount of such withholding and other tax requirements, subject to any rules adopted by the Committee or required to ensure compliance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Any cash payment made under this Agreement shall be made net of any amounts required to be withheld or paid with respect thereto (and with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock delivered therewith) under any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding and other tax requirements.
Transferability
Unless otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the award granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by the Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The term Participant as used in this Agreement shall include any permitted transferee.

The Committee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel.
Amendment
The Committee shall have the right to alter or amend the LTIP and this Agreement in its sole discretion, from time to time, as provided in the Plan in any manner for the purpose of promoting the objectives of the Plan, provided that no such amendment shall impair the Participant's rights under the LTIP without the Participant's consent; provided, however, the Participants consent shall not be required for any
