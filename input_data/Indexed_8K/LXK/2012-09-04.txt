Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 28, 2012, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $200 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $351 million at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $251 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on August 28, 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement) with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $100 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Citibank.  The ASR Agreement requires Citibank to deliver to the Company on September 4, 2012, 3,931,545 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $21.62, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on August 28, 2012.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Citibank under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Citibank, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Citibank as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the second half of 2012.
The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the ASR Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2012.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
