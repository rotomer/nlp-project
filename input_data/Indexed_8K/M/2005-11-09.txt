EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
    CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 9, 2005 - Federated Department Stores, Inc. today reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.78 for the third quarter of 2005, ended Oct. 29. This compares to diluted earnings per share of 42 cents in the same 13-week period last year.
    Federated's sales and earnings for September and October 2005 include results of The May Department Stores Company, which was acquired Aug. 30, 2005. Sales and earnings from the company's Bridal Group division, which the company intends to divest, is being treated as a discontinued operation.
    Included in the 2005 third quarter are a one-time pre-tax gain of $480 million ($384 million after tax, or $1.58 per diluted share) on the sale of receivables to Citigroup and pre-tax integration costs of $63 million ($39 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to the May Company merger.
    Excluding these items, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were 36 cents for the third quarter of 2005. This exceeded previous guidance of 20-25 cents per diluted share in part because of a gain of approximately $10 million or $.03 per diluted share related to Federated's portion of the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. Additionally, operating performance has exceeded expectations since previous guidance was provided, particularly in the former May Company divisions.
    For the first three quarters of 2005, Federated reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $3.57, compared to $1.38 a share in the same period of 2004. Excluding the gain on sale of receivables of $1.95 per diluted share and integration costs of $.20 per diluted share, earnings per diluted share for the first three quarters of 2005 were $1.82.
    Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company was pleased with its third quarter and year-to-date earnings performance, which were achieved in spite of a number of potentially distracting events, including major hurricanes and the initial stages of merger integration with May Company.
Sales
    Sales in the third quarter totaled $5.785 billion, an increase of 64.1 percent compared to sales of $3.525 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's third quarter sales were up 0.6 percent.
    For the year to date, Federated's sales totaled $13.049 billion, an increase of 22.5 percent from sales of $10.656 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's sales for the first 39 weeks of 2005 were up 1.4 percent.
    In the third quarter, the company opened seven new department stores - three Foley's in San Antonio and Dallas, TX, and Loveland, CO; one Hecht's in North Charlotte, NC; one Kaufmann's in Columbus, OH; one Macy's and one Robinsons-May in Simi Valley, CA. One Macy's store was closed in Kokomo, IN. The company's bridal group opened 12 stores in September and October, including five David's Bridal and seven After Hours Formalwear locations. One After Hours store was closed.
    Five Macy's stores in south Florida and New Orleans will remain closed from damage related to Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina through the remainder of 2005. These locations accounted for $59 million in sales in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Operating Income
    Federated's operating income totaled $701 million or 12.1 percent of sales for the quarter ended Oct. 29, 2005, compared to operating income of $175 million or 5.0 percent of sales for the same period last year.
    The company's operating income for the first 39 weeks of 2005 was $1.244 billion or 9.5 percent of sales, compared to $637 million or 6.0 percent of sales in the same period of 2004.
    Federated's operating income includes a pre-tax gain of $480 million on the sale of receivables to Citigroup and integration costs of $63 million in the third quarter this year. In the same period last year, Federated's operating income included $36 million in store closing, centralization and consolidation costs. On a year-to-date basis, these items increased operating income by $417 million this year, compared to a reduction of $86 million for the same period last year.
Cash Flow
    Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by two major transactions: the acquisition of May Company on Aug. 30 and the sale of proprietary and Visa accounts receivable to Citigroup on Oct. 24. The May
    Company acquisition was funded with $1.1 billion cash on hand and $4.6 billion in short-term borrowings. Pretax proceeds from the sale of the credit receivables, after elimination of $1.2 billion in receivables backed debt, was used to pay down $2.8 billion in short-term borrowings.
    The company repurchased no shares of its common stock in the third quarter.
Fourth Quarter Expectations
    The company's guidance for the fourth quarter is unchanged. Federated continues to anticipate same-store sales for the fourth quarter to increase 1 to 2 percent over last year. Earnings of $2.00 to $2.20 per share are expected from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding integration-related pre-tax costs of $100 million to $150 million, the company expects fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.35 to $2.45 per share.

Notes:
(1)     Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. The May Department Stores Company ("May") was acquired August 30, 2005. The results of operations of May have been included in Federated's results of operations from the date of acquisition. Certain reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform with the classifications of such amounts for the most recent period.
(2)     Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005 or October 30, 2004. For the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2004, cost of sales includes inventory valuation adjustments of $14 million related to the Macy's home store centralization. For the 39 weeks ended October 30, 2004, cost of sales includes inventory valuation adjustments of $31 million related to the Macy's home store centralization and the Burdines-Macy's consolidation.
(3)     For the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2004, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses include $22 million of costs incurred in connection with the Macy's home store centralization, the Burdines-Macy's consolidation and other store closings. For the 39 weeks ended October 30, 2004, SG&A expenses include $55 million of costs incurred in connection with the Macy's home store centralization, the Burdines-Macy's consolidation and other store closings.
(4)     Represents costs and expenses associated with the integration and consolidation of May's operations into Federated's operations. For the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005, such costs primarily relate to impairment charges for certain Federated stores planned to be closed and amounted to $.16 and $.20 per diluted share, respectively.
(5)     Represents the gain recognized on the sale of proprietary and non-proprietary credit card accounts receivable. For the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005, the after-tax net gain amounted to $1.58 and $1.95 per diluted share, respectively.
(6)     Interest expense for the 39 weeks ended October 30, 2004 includes $59 million of one-time costs, or 20 cents a diluted share, associated with the repurchase of $274 million of Federated's 8.5% senior notes due 2010.
(7)     Federal, state and local income tax expense for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005 was reduced by approximately $85 million to recognize capital loss carryforwards realized as a result of the sale of credit card accounts receivable.
(8)     For the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 30, 2004, store closing and consolidation costs and Macy's home store centralization costs (See notes 2 and 3) amounted to $.13 and $.30 per diluted share, respectively.
 
 
 
Note - Certain reclassifications were made to prior year's amounts to reflect increases in non-proprietary accounts receivable as cash used by investing activities instead of operating activities to conform with the classifications of such amounts for the most recent year.
