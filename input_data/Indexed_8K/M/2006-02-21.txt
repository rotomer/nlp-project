FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, February 21, 2006 - Federated Department Stores, Inc. today reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.45 for the fourth quarter of 2005, ended Jan. 28, 2006. This compares with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.55 for the same 13-week period last year.
Excluding May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $131 million ($82 million after tax or 29 cents per diluted share), fourth quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.74. This exceeds the company's prior guidance of $2.60 to $2.65 per share.
Federated's sales and earnings for September 2005 through January 2006 include results of The May Department Stores Company, which was acquired Aug. 30, 2005. Sales and earnings from the company's Lord & Taylor and Bridal Group divisions, which the company intends to divest, are being treated as discontinued operations.
For the full 52 weeks of fiscal 2005, Federated reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.32, compared to $3.86 per share in the same period of 2004. Excluding the May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of 56 cents per diluted share ($194 million pre-tax, $121 million after tax) and a gain on the sale of receivables of $1.77 per diluted share ($480 million pre-tax, $384 million after tax), earnings from continuing operations per diluted share for fiscal 2005 were $5.11.
Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance. The quarter included stronger-than-expected performance in both the Federated and former May Company divisions, as well as a benefit from a tax settlement and related adjustments. Across the organization, our executives and associates demonstrated exceptional discipline and focus through the holiday selling season, despite potential distractions related to the merger.
"As we have said in the past, 2006 will be a transition year in which sales and earnings performance will be difficult to predict. Keep in mind that each of the next three quarters presents a unique set of challenges that may affect short-term sales and/or earnings, given the process of store divestitures, assortment assimilation and brand conversions between now and this fall," Lundgren said.
Sales
Sales in the fourth quarter totaled $9.571 billion, an increase of 86.9 percent compared to sales of $5.120 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's fourth quarter sales were up 1.1 percent.
Federated's fiscal 2005 sales totaled $22.390 billion, an increase of 41.9 percent from sales of $15.776 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's sales for fiscal 2005 were up 1.3 percent.
The company opened no new department stores in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Five Macy's stores in south Florida and New Orleans remain closed from damage related to Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina in 2005. These locations accounted for $59 million in sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. At least three of these stores are expected to reopen in fiscal 2006.
Operating Income
Federated's operating income totaled $1.194 billion or 12.5 percent of sales for the quarter ended Jan. 28, 2006, compared to operating income of $763 million or 14.9 percent of sales for the same period last year.
The company's operating income for fiscal 2005 was $2.424 billion or 10.8 percent of sales, compared to $1.400 billion or 8.9 percent of sales in fiscal 2004.
Federated's fourth quarter 2005 operating income includes $131 million in May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments. Fiscal 2005 operating income includes a pre-tax gain of $480 million on the sale of receivables to Citigroup and May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $194 million. Federated's fourth quarter 2004 operating income included $13 million in store closing, centralization and consolidation costs, as well as inventory valuation adjustments. Fiscal 2004 operating income included $99 million in store closing, centralization and consolidation costs, as well as inventory valuation adjustments.
Cash Flow
In fiscal 2005, Federated generated $1.95 billion in cash flow from continuing operating activities, compared to $1.51 billion in fiscal 2004. Federated used $2.5 billion of cash for continuing investing activities in fiscal 2005, compared to $727 million in fiscal 2004. Cash used by continuing financing activities was $58 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $837 million the previous year.
Cash flow in fiscal 2005 was impacted by two major transactions: the acquisition of May Company on Aug. 30 and the sale of proprietary and Visa accounts receivable to Citigroup on Oct. 24. The May Company acquisition was funded with $1.1 billion cash on hand and $4.6 billion in short-term borrowings. Pretax proceeds from the sale of the credit receivables, after elimination of $1.2 billion in receivables backed debt, was used to pay down $2.8 billion in short-term borrowings. At Jan. 28, 2006, approximately $1.2 billion of short-term borrowings were outstanding. At the time of the May Company acquisition, the company established a $5 billion bridge line, of which $2.25 billion is still available to the company.
The company repurchased no shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter.
2006 Guidance
The company's guidance for 2006 is unchanged. Federated continues to anticipate same-store sales to increase by 2 to 3 percent in 2006, with first quarter sales of $5.75 billion to $6 billion, incorporating a same-store sales decrease of 0.5 to 1.5 percent compared to last year. Earnings of $3.45 to $3.70 per diluted share are expected in 2006 from continuing operations excluding one-time May Company merger integration costs and gain on sale of receivables. This includes a loss of 5 to 15 cents per diluted share in the first quarter from continuing operations excluding one-time May Company merger integration costs.
