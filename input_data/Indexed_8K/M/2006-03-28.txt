FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
FEDERATED PLANS 2-FOR-1 STOCK SPLIT Board of Directors approves dividend increase
Company to seek shareholder authorization to increase number of common shares;
CINCINNATI, OHIO, March 28, 2006The Board of Directors ofFederated Department Stores, Inc. today said it intends to split the company's common stock on a two-for-one basis if shareholders approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Federated common stock.  The intended stock split would be effected through a stock dividend entitling each shareholder of record to receive one additional share of common stock for every one share owned.             The company will seek shareholder approval for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Federated common stock. A vote to increase the number of common shares authorized from 500 million to 1 billion will be conducted in conjunction with Federated's Annual Meeting on May 19, 2006.             If shareholders vote in favor of the increased authorization, the Board of Directors plans to approve the stock split, and additional shares issued as a result of the stock dividend would be distributed after close of trading on June 9, 2006, to shareholders of record on May 26, 2006. Following the approval of the stock split, shareholders would not need to exchange existing stock certificates and would receive a Direct Registration Statement at the time of the split, reflecting the newly issued shares. Trading would begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 12, 2006.             This action would represent the first stock split since Federated was listed in its current form on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1992.             In addition, the Board of Directors has declared a 2 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend payable July 3, 2006, to Federated shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2006. If the stock splits, the quarterly dividend will be 12.75 cents per outstanding common share. If the stock does not split, the quarterly dividend will be 25.5 cents per outstanding common share.             "These actions reflect our confidence in the future operating results and cash flow of the company, as well as our ongoing determination to build long-term shareholder value," said Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer.             Additional information regarding shareholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Federated common stock is included in the preliminary proxy statement that Federated plans to file no later than Wednesday, March 29, 2006, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Federated, its directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees, as well as its proxy solicitor, Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., may be soliciting proxies from shareholders in favor of the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares.
