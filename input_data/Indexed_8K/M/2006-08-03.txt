     For the 13-week second quarter of 2006, Federated reported total sales of $5.998 billion, up 65.5 percent over sales of $3.623 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's second quarter sales were up 4.6 percent, within the company's guidance for a same-store sales increase of 4 percent to 6 percent in the second quarter.
     For the year to date, Federated's sales totaled $11.928 billion, up 64.2 percent from total sales of $7.264 billion in the first 26 weeks of 2005. On a same-store basis, Federated's year-to-date sales were up 2.2 percent.
