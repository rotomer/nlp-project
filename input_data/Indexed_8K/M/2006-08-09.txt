EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
    CINCINNATI, Ohio, August 9, 2006 - Federated Department Stores, Inc. today reported earnings of 51 cents per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006, ended July 29, 2006. This compares with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 42 cents for the same 13-week period last year.
    Excluding May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $177 million ($111 million after tax or 19 cents per diluted share) and the gains on the sale of credit receivables of $191 million ($119 million after tax or 21 cents per diluted share), second quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 49 cents. This exceeds the company's prior guidance for earnings of 39 cents to 44 cents per share excluding merger integration costs, related inventory valuation adjustments and gain on sale of credit receivables.
    Second quarter results benefited from a previously announced cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service. The refund reduced income tax expense by approximately $80 million and interest expense by approximately $17 million. In aggregate, this contributed 16 cents per diluted share to second quarter earnings.
    For the first half of 2006, Federated reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 37 cents per share, compared with 78 cents per share in the first half of 2005. Excluding May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $306 million ($192 million after tax or 34 cents per diluted share) and the gains on the sale of credit receivables of $191 million ($119 million after tax or 21 cents per diluted share), diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 50 cents in the first half of 2006.
    Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We were pleased to have exceeded our earnings guidance this quarter, indicating that the Federated-May Company integration process remains solidly on track. In particular, we are pleased with the comp store sales progress in existing Macy's and Bloomingdale's locations, which reflect our strategy beyond the nationwide Macy's brand launch beginning Sept. 9.
    "We are still in the process of transitioning the former May Company locations with significant merchandise assortment change-outs, clearance sales of discontinued inventory and remodeling activity which is disruptive to the business, and our sales performance in these stores continues to lag," Lundgren said. "We are looking forward to getting this work behind us and returning to a more normalized pace of activity after the nameplate changes in September."
    Federated's sales and earnings for the second quarter and first half of 2006 include results of The May Department Stores Company, which was acquired Aug. 30, 2005. Sales and earnings from the company's Lord & Taylor and Bridal Group divisions, which the company intends to divest, are being treated as discontinued operations.
Sales
    Sales in the second quarter totaled $5.995 billion, an increase of 65 percent compared to sales of $3.623 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's second quarter sales were up 4.6 percent, within the company's guidance for a same-store sales increase of 4 percent to 6 percent in the second quarter.
    For the year to date, Federated's sales totaled $11.925 billion, up 64 percent from total sales of $7.264 billion in the first 26 weeks of 2005. On a same-store basis, Federated's year-to-date sales were up 2.2 percent.
    The company opened no new department stores in the second quarter of 2006. Aside from duplicate locations being divested, two stores were closed - a Macy's store in Pocatello, ID, and a Macy's Furniture Gallery in Augusta, GA.
Operating Income
    Federated's operating income totaled $422 million or 7.0 percent of sales for the quarter ended July 29, 2006, compared to operating income of $291 million or 8.0 percent of sales for the same period last year. Federated's second quarter 2006 operating income included $177 million in May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, and gains of $191 million on the sale of credit receivables. Excluding these items, operating income for the second quarter was $408 million.
    For the first half of 2006, Federated's operating income totaled $442 million or 3.7 percent of sales, compared to operating income of $543 million or 7.5 percent of sales for the same period last year. Federated's first half 2006 operating income includes $306 million in May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, as well as gains of $191 million on the sale of credit receivables. Excluding these items, operating income was $557 million.
Cash Flow
    Federated generated $2.281 billion in cash from continuing operating activities in the first half of 2006, compared to $665 million in the same period last year. Cash generated by continuing investing activities was $240 million in the first half of this year, compared with the use of $237 million in the same period last year, resulting in cash flow from continuing operating activities before continuing financing activities of $2.521 billion in the first half of this year and $428 million in the first half of last year. In addition, the company generated $35 million in net cash from discontinued operations in the first half of 2006.
    A series of major transactions contributed to cash flow in the first half of 2006. Cash generated from continuing operating activities includes $1.860 billion in proceeds from the sale of May Company credit receivables. Cash from continuing investing activities includes Federated's purchase of $1.141 billion in credit receivables from General Electric Capital Corporation, which then were sold to Citigroup for $1.323 billion (for a net increase of $182 million), as well as $443 million from the disposal of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of approximately 60 duplicate store locations.
    Additional transactions will contribute to cash flow in the second half of 2006. These are expected to include the sales of the Lord & Taylor and Bridal Group divisions, as well as the sale of at least three additional duplicate stores being divested.
    Proceeds from transactions to date in 2006 have been used to pay down short-term borrowings associated with the May Company acquisition and to begin repurchasing shares. The company used approximately $287 million of excess cash to repurchase approximately 8.1 million shares of Federated common stock in the second quarter of 2006.
    At the end of the second quarter, the company had remaining authorization to purchase up to approximately $383 million of common stock. Management expects to request additional authorization from the Board of Directors.
    In the second quarter, the company redeemed $200 million of principal amount senior bonds at a price of $208.3 million.
Looking Ahead
    Federated is increasing its earnings and same-store sales guidance for the second half of 2006. Guidance for diluted earnings per share, excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, now is 15 cents to 20 cents for the third quarter and $1.40 to $1.50 for the fourth quarter, compared with previous guidance of $1.50 to $1.62 per share in the two periods combined. For 2006 as a whole, Federated expects diluted earnings of $2.00 to $2.15 per share excluding merger integration costs, related inventory valuation adjustments and gain on the sale of credit receivables.
    The company now expects same-store sales to increase by 3 percent to 5 percent in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2006, compared with previous guidance for sales to grow by 2 percent to 4 percent in the third and fourth quarters combined. Federated reiterated total sales expectations of between $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion in the third quarter, and between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
