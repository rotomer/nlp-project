3.     
Exhibit 99.1
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 8, 2006 - Federated Department Stores, Inc. today reported earnings of 3 cents per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006, ended Oct. 28, 2006. This compares with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 87 cents for the same 13-week period last year.
Excluding May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $145 million ($90 million after tax or 17 cents per diluted share), third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 20 cents. This is at the high end of the company's prior guidance for earnings of 15 cents to 20 cents per share excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments.
Included in the 2005 third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was a one-time pretax gain of $480 million ($384 million after tax, or 79 cents per share) on the sale of credit card receivables to Citigroup, as well as merger integration costs of $63 million ($39 million after tax, or 8 cents per diluted share). Excluding these items, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were 16 cents for the third quarter of 2005. The 16 cents in last year's third quarter included a gain of approximately $10 million, or 1.5 cents per diluted share, related to Federated's portion of an antitrust litigation settlement.
For the first three quarters of 2006, Federated reported diluted earnings from continuing operations of 41 cents per share, compared with $1.76 per share in the same period of 2005. Excluding May Company merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments of $451 million ($282 million after tax or 50 cents per diluted share) and the gains on the sale of credit card receivables of $191 million ($119 million after tax or 21 cents per diluted share), diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 70 cents in the first three quarters of 2006.
This compares with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 89 cents in the same period last year, excluding merger integration costs of $63 million ($39 million after tax or 10 cents per diluted share) and gain on the sale of credit card receivables of $480 million ($384 million after tax or 97 cents per diluted share).
Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our third quarter earnings performance was at the high end of our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, we're ahead of our guidance. We continue to view 2006 as a transition year that has included a tremendous amount of change for our organization, notably a transition of more than 400 stores to the Macy's nameplate. With a new brand structure now fully in place, we look forward to a successful holiday selling season and to continued improvement in financial results in 2007."
Federated's sales and earnings for the third quarter and 2006 year-to-date include results of The May Department Stores Company, which was acquired Aug. 30, 2005. For 2005, former May Company locations are included only for periods after Aug. 30. Sales and earnings from the company's Lord & Taylor division, which Federated sold in October 2006, and Bridal Group division, which the company is divesting, are treated as discontinued operations.
Sales
Sales in the third quarter totaled $5.886 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to sales of $5.555 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Federated's third quarter sales were up 5.9 percent. The company's prior third quarter guidance was for total sales of between $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion, and for a same-store sales increase of between 3 percent and 5 percent.
For the year to date, Federated's sales totaled $17.811 billion, up 39 percent from total sales of $12.819 billion in the first 39 weeks of 2005. On a same-store basis, Federated's year-to-date sales were up 3.5 percent.
The company opened four new department stores in the third quarter of 2006 - Macy's in Philadelphia, Denver and Chula Vista, CA, and a Bloomingdale's in San Francisco. Aside from duplicate locations being divested, no stores were closed.
Operating Income
Federated's operating income totaled $134 million or 2.3 percent of sales for the quarter ended Oct. 28, 2006, compared to operating income of $687 million or 12.4 percent of sales for the same period last year. Federated's third quarter 2006 operating income included $145 million in May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments. Federated's third quarter 2005 operating income included $63 million in May Company integration costs, as well as a gain of $480 million on the sale of credit card receivables.
Excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was $279 million or 4.7 percent of sales. In the third quarter of 2005, operating income excluding merger integration costs and gain on the sale of credit card receivables was $270 million or 4.9 percent of sales.
For the first 39 weeks of 2006, Federated's operating income totaled $576 million or 3.2 percent of sales, compared to operating income of $1.230 billion or 9.6 percent of sales for the same period last year. Federated's year-to-date 2006 operating income includes $451 million in May Company integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, as well as gains of $191 million on the sale of credit card receivables. Federated's year-to-date 2005 operating income included $63 million in May Company integration costs, as well as a gain of $480 million on the sale of credit card receivables.
Excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, as well as gains on the sale of credit card receivables, year-to-date operating income in 2006 was $836 million or 4.7 percent of sales. For the first three quarters of 2005, operating income excluding merger integration costs and gain on the sale of credit card receivables was $813 million or 6.3 percent of sales.
Cash Flow
Federated generated $1.971 billion in cash from continuing operating activities in the first 39 weeks of 2006, compared to $2.316 billion in the same period last year. Cash generated by continuing investing activities was $865 million in the first 39 weeks of this year, compared with $4.446 billion used in the same period last year (primarily for the acquisition of May Company), resulting in cash flow from continuing operating activities before continuing financing activities of $2.836 billion generated year-to-date in 2006 and $2.130 billion used in the same period last year. In addition, the company generated $32 million in net cash from discontinued operations year-to-date in 2006.
A series of major transactions contributed to cash flow in the first three quarters of 2006. Cash generated from continuing operating activities includes $1.860 billion in proceeds from the sale of May Company credit card receivables. Cash from continuing investing activities includes $1.047 billion in proceeds from the sale of Lord & Taylor and Federated's purchase of $1.141 billion in credit card receivables from General Electric Capital Corporation, which then were sold to Citigroup for $1.323 billion (for a net increase of $182 million), as well as $494 million from the disposal of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of approximately 61 duplicate store locations.
Additional transactions will contribute to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2006. These are expected to include the sale of at least two additional duplicate stores being divested.
Proceeds from transactions to date in 2006 have been used to pay down short-term borrowings associated with the May Company acquisition and to repurchase shares. The company used approximately $1.1 billion of excess cash to repurchase approximately 28 million shares of Federated common stock in the first three quarters of 2006.
At the end of the third quarter, the company had remaining authorization to purchase up to approximately $1.6 billion of common stock.
Looking Ahead
The company's guidance for the fourth quarter is unchanged. Federated continues to anticipate same-store sales for the fourth quarter to increase by 3 percent to 5 percent over last year. Total fourth quarter sales are expected in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion. Guidance for diluted earnings per share, excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, is $1.40 to $1.50 for the fourth quarter.
Federated, with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, is one of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2006 sales expected to be about $27 billion. Federated operates more than 850 department stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico under the names of Macy's and Bloomingdale's. The company also operates macys.com, bloomingdales.com and Bloomingdale's By Mail.

 Notes:
1.     Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. The May Department Stores Company ("May") was acquired August 30, 2005. The results of operations of May have been included in Federated's results of operations from the date of acquisition. Certain reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform with the classifications of such amounts for the most recent period. Share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed after the close of trading on June 9, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 26, 2006.
2.     Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2006 or October 29, 2005.
