5.4   Upon request by CSNY, Counterparty shall, at least one day prior to the first day of the Price Adjustment Period, notify CSNY of the total number of Shares purchased in Rule 10b-18 purchases of blocks pursuant to the once-a-week block exception contained in Rule 10b-18(b)(4) by or for Counterparty or any of its affiliated purchasers during each of the four calendar weeks preceding the first day of the Price Adjustment Period and during the calendar week in which the first day of the Price Adjustment Period occurs ("Rule 10b-18 purchase", "blocks" and "affiliated purchaser" each being used as defined in Rule 10b-18).
5.5   Neither Counterparty nor any of its affiliates shall take any action that would cause any CS purchases of Shares in connection with this Transaction not to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act if such purchases were made by Counterparty.  Without limiting the foregoing, Counterparty shall not designate a Daily Number of Shares for any Valuation Date in excess of the Number of Shares it would be permitted to purchase on such date pursuant to the safe harbor in Rule 10b-18(b) (taking into account any other purchases by Counterparty or its "affiliated purchasers" (as defined in Rule 10b-18) on such day).
5.6   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Definitions, to the extent that an Announcement Date for a potential Merger Transaction occurs during the Price Adjustment Period:
(a)    Promptly after request from CSNY, Counterparty shall provide CSNY with written notice specifying (i) Counterparty's average daily Rule 10b-18 purchases (as defined in Rule 10b-18) during the three full calendar months immediately preceding the Announcement Date that were not effected through CS, and (ii) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the proviso in Rule 10b-18(b)(4) for the three full months preceding the Announcement Date.  Such written notice shall be deemed to be a certification by Counterparty to CSNY that such information is true and correct.  Counterparty understands that CSNY will use this information in calculating the trading volume for purposes of Rule 10b-18; and
(b)   CSNY may in its good faith sole discretion, if it determines the resulting reduction in permissible volume of Rule 10b-18 purchases to be material, designate one or more Scheduled Trading Days in the period from and including the public announcement thereof to and including the earlier of the completion of such transaction or the completion of the vote by target shareholders to be Disrupted Days and extend the Price Adjustment Period Termination Date by the number of Disrupted Days so designated.
For the avoidance of doubt, "" in this Section 5.6 means any merger, acquisition or similar transaction involving a recapitalization as contemplated by Rule 10b-18(a)(13)(iv).

Indemnification and Contribution
6.1  
Indemnification by Counterparty:
 
Counterparty agrees to indemnify and hold harmless CSNY, its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, brokers and representatives and each person who controls CSNY or its affiliates within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against, and Counterparty agrees that no indemnified party shall have any liability to Counterparty or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, or employees for, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) or expenses, joint or several, to which any indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions, claims, investigations or proceedings in respect thereof, whether commenced or threatened) (i) arise out of or relate to (A) actions or failures to act by Counterparty or (B) actions or failures to act by an indemnified party with the consent of, upon the direction of, Counterparty or (ii) otherwise arise out of or relate to the Transaction or any related transactions. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1 shall not apply to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final and nonappealable judgment by a court to have resulted primarily from a material breach by CSNY of the Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of CSNY. Counterparty agrees to reimburse promptly each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damages, liability, expense or action.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Counterparty may otherwise have.
 
6.2  :
Contribution
        If the indemnification provided for above is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then Counterparty, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault of Counterparty on the one hand and of CSNY on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, but also any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of Counterparty on the one hand and CSNY on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other considerations, whether the misstatement or alleged misstatement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Counterparty or by CSNY and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.2 were determined by a method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
7.     :
Distribution Event
        Counterparty represents that it is not engaged as of the Trade Date in a distribution, as such term is used in Regulation M under the Exchange Act, other than a distribution referred to in Rules 102(b) and 102(c) of Regulation M (a "").  On any day prior to the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the last day of the later of the Price Adjustment Period or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period, as the case may be, neither Counterparty nor any of its affiliates or agents shall make a Distribution of Shares, or any security for which the Shares are a reference security (as defined in Regulation M) that would, in the view of CSNY, preclude Counterparty from purchasing Shares or cause any such purchases to violate any law, rule or regulation.  If, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, on any Scheduled Trading Day during the Price Adjustment Period or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period Counterparty or any of its affiliates or agents shall engage in any Distribution, CSNY may, in its good faith sole discretion, designate such day a Disrupted Day and, in connection with such designation, extend the Price Adjustment Period Termination Date or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period, as applicable, by one Valuation Day for each day that such Distribution continues.
Distribution
        If a Distribution occurs, then Counterparty agrees that it will provide to CSNY at least one Scheduled Trading Day's notice of such Distribution and will use its reasonable efforts to cause such Distribution to be completed or otherwise terminated as soon as reasonably practicable given the circumstances of the Distribution, it being understood that it is fully within Counterparty's discretion to undertake transactions pursuant to Regulation M.

Indemnification and Contribution

Indemnification by Counterparty:
 
Counterparty agrees to indemnify and hold harmless CSNY, its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, brokers and representatives and each person who controls CSNY or its affiliates within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against, and Counterparty agrees that no indemnified party shall have any liability to Counterparty or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, or employees for, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) or expenses, joint or several, to which any indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions, claims, investigations or proceedings in respect thereof, whether commenced or threatened) (i) arise out of or relate to (A) actions or failures to act by Counterparty or (B) actions or failures to act by an indemnified party with the consent of, upon the direction of, Counterparty or (ii) otherwise arise out of or relate to the Transaction or any related transactions. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1 shall not apply to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final and nonappealable judgment by a court to have resulted primarily from a material breach of the Agreement by CSNY or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of CSNY. Counterparty agrees to reimburse promptly each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damages, liability, expense or action.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Counterparty may otherwise have.

Contribution
        If the indemnification provided for above is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then Counterparty, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault of Counterparty on the one hand and of CSNY on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, but also any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of Counterparty on the one hand and CSNY on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other considerations, whether the misstatement or alleged misstatement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Counterparty or by CSNY and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.2 were determined by a method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph.

Distribution Event
        Counterparty represents that it is not engaged as of the Trade Date in a distribution, as such term is used in Regulation M under the Exchange Act, other than a distribution referred to in Rules 102(b) and 102(c) of Regulation M (a "").  On any day prior to the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the last day of the later of the Price Adjustment Period or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period, as the case may be, neither Counterparty nor any of its affiliates or agents shall make a Distribution of Shares, or any security for which the Shares are a reference security (as defined in Regulation M) that would, in the view of CSNY, preclude Counterparty from purchasing Shares or cause any such purchases to violate any law, rule or regulation.  If, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, on any Scheduled Trading Day during the Price Adjustment Period or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period Counterparty or any of its affiliates or agents shall engage in any Distribution, CSNY may, in its good faith sole discretion, designate such day a Disrupted Day and, in connection with such designation, extend the Scheduled Termination Date or the Cash Settlement Pricing Period, as applicable, by one Valuation Day for each day that such Distribution continues.
Distribution
        If a Distribution occurs, then Counterparty agrees that it will provide to CSNY at least one Scheduled Trading Day's notice of such Distribution and will use its reasonable efforts to cause such Distribution to be completed or otherwise terminated as soon as reasonably practicable given the circumstances of the Distribution, it being understood that it is fully within Counterparty's discretion to undertake transactions pursuant to Regulation M.

Exhibit 99.1
 
     CINCINNATI, Ohio, February 27, 2007 - Federated Department Stores, Inc. today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $4 billion increase in the company's stock buyback program. At the current share price, this buyback would represent about 18 percent of Federated's common shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2006.
     Federated has used a portion of this authorization to effect the immediate repurchase of 45 million outstanding shares for an initial payment of approximately $2 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs both advised the company with respect to the accelerated share repurchase program. The repurchased shares are subject to a future purchase price adjustment following the completion of the program, such that Federated may receive, or may be required to pay, a price adjustment based on share prices during specified periods as provided in its agreements. The remaining authorization can be used by the company to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in other negotiated transactions.
     "The Board's decision reinforces its confidence in the future of our company as we continue to implement strategies for building Macy's and Bloomingdale's as nationwide brands," said Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We believe that repurchasing shares is a very productive use of excess cash and balance sheet capacity."
     Federated's accelerated share repurchase program is being funded initially by excess cash and short-term borrowings.
      (Editor's Note: Federated this morning issued three additional news releases - one reporting fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 financial results, one declaring a regular quarterly dividend, and another announcing plans for a corporate name change.)
     The Board's additional authorization extends a repurchase program that resumed in the second quarter of 2006 as Federated paid down short-term borrowings associated with its acquisition of The May Department Stores Company. Approximately $2.5 billion was used to repurchase shares in fiscal 2006, and approximately $170 million of authorization remained at year-end.
     Federated, with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, is one of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2006 sales of $27 billion. Federated operates more than 850 department stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico under the names of Macy's and Bloomingdale's. The company also operates macys.com, bloomingdales.com and Bloomingdale's By Mail.
     All statements in this press release that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Federated's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this release because of a variety of factors, including conditions to, or changes in the timing of, proposed transactions, prevailing interest rates, competitive pressures from specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers' outlets, off-price and discount stores, new and established forms of home shopping (including the Internet, mail-order catalogs and television) and general consumer spending levels, including the impact of the availability and level of consumer debt, the effect of weather and other factors ide ntified in documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
