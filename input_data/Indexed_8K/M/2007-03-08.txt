8.

Indemnified Party
(b)     Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their directors and each of their officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, an "") against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter Indemnified Party  may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement at any time, any Statutory Prospectus as of any time, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement at any time, any Statutory Prospectus as of any time, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by an Underwriter through the Representative consists of the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" of the Prospectus  and the eighth and ninth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" of the Prospectus concerning stabilizing transactions.
Underwriter Indemnified Party
(c)     Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)     If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e)     The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10.       (a)     If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase any of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the Underwriters or another party or other parties to purchase such Notes on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Underwriters to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes or the Company notifies the Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, as the case may be, the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Statutory Prospectus, any prospectus wrapper and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus which in the opinion of the Underwriters may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
Underwriter
(b)     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes as set forth in Schedule A hereto, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of such Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of such Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of such Notes of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes as set forth in Schedule A hereto, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(d)        For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) above, including the calculations contemplated thereby, shall be applied separately to any 2012 Notes to which they are applicable, on the one hand, and to any 2037 Notes to which they are applicable, on the other hand.
11.       The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter,  the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
12.       If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company and the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13.       All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Underwriters in care of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010-3629, Attention:  Transactions Advisory Group; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Financial Officer and Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Underwriters upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
14.       This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company, the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Notes from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15.       Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

Exhibit 5.1
 
Federated Department Stores, Inc. Federated Retail Holdings, Inc. 7 West Seventh Street Cincinnati, Ohio 45202
Re: Issuance of $1.1 billion Senior Notes due 2012 and $500 million Senior Notes due 2037 of
Federated Retail Holdings, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel for Federated Retail Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation ("Federated Holdings"), in connection with its offering of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of Federated Holdings' 5.35% senior notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes") and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Federated Holdings' 6.375% senior notes due 2037 (the "2037 Notes," and together with the 2012 Notes, the "Debt Securities"), which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantees") by Federated Department Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Federated"), as contemplated by Federated's and Federated Holdings' Registration Statement No. 333-138376 on Form S-3, as amended by the post-effective amendment dated February 28, 2007, to which this opinion is an exhibit (as the same may be further amended from time to time, the "Registration Statement"). The 2012 Notes will be issued under an indenture, dated as of November 2, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), a mong Federated Holdings, as issuer, Federated, as guarantor, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, and the 2037 Notes will be issued under the Base Indenture as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture, each such supplemental indenture to be entered into among Federated Holdings, Federated and the Trustee (together the "Supplemental Indentures" and, collectively with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") relating to the Debt Securities. The Debt Securities and the Guarantees are collectively referred to herein as the "Securities."
     In rendering this opinion, we have examined such documents, records and matters of law as we have deemed necessary for purposes of this opinion. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
The Debt Securities, when executed by Federated Holdings and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture, issued and sold in accordance with the Registration Statement and delivered to the purchaser or purchasers thereof against receipt by Federated Holdings of such lawful consideration therefor as Federated Holding's Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may determine, will constitute valid and binding obligations of Federated Holdings.
Upon the execution, authentication, issuance, sale and delivery of the Debt Securities as described above, the Guarantees thereof will constitute valid and binding obligations of Federated.
     We have assumed that (i) the Base Indenture is, and each of the Supplemental Indentures will be, a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee; (ii) the definitive terms of the Securities will be established in accordance with (a) applicable law and (b) the provisions of the Base Indenture as supplemented by the applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (iii) each of the Supplemental Indentures will be duly executed and delivered by Federated Holdings, Federated and the Trustee.
     For purposes of our opinion set forth in paragraph 2, we have assumed that the obligations of Federated under the Guarantees will be, and would be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be, in furtherance of its corporate purposes, or necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of the business of Federated and will benefit Federated, directly or indirectly.
     Our opinions are limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, conveyance, voidable preference, moratorium or other similar laws, regulations or judicial opinions of general applicability, including those relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) general equitable principles and public policy considerations, whether such principles and considerations are considered in a proceeding at law or at equity.
     The opinions expressed herein are limited to the federal securities laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such law, in each case as currently in effect, and we express no opinion as to the effect of any other law of the State of Delaware or the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to Jones Day under the caption "Certain Legal Matters" in the prospectus constituting a part of such Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Jones Day
