    Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Despite the unseasonably warm weather in September and October, we were able to deliver third quarter same-store sales within our guidance and earnings per share at the top end of our guidance. We have a wide range of new and distinctive merchandise in our assortment for the holiday season at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and we believe we will compete successfully in the fourth quarter, despite what continues to be a challenging economic environment."

Looking Ahead
    Macy's, Inc. expects same-store sales in the range of down 2 percent to up 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.

For fiscal 2007 as a whole, same-store sales are expected in the range of down 0.3 percent to down 1.3 percent.
    Total sales are expected to be $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. (Note that the fourth quarter of 2007 has one less week than the fourth quarter of 2006.) For fiscal 2007 as a whole, total sales are expected to be $26.4 billion to $26.6 billion.
    Earnings per diluted share, excluding merger integration costs, are expected to be $1.70 to $1.80 in the fourth quarter. Merger integration costs for the fourth quarter are expected to be between $60 million to $70 million, most of which will be non-cash charges.
