Excluding May Company merger integration costs of $69 million ($43 million after tax or 10 cents per diluted share), fourth quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.83. Included in 2007 fourth quarter is a non-cash tax credit of $78 million (18 cents per diluted share) from the settlement of a federal income tax examination, primarily attributable to losses related to the disposition of a former subsidiary. Also excluding the tax settlement, fourth quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.65.
           The fourth quarter of 2006 included merger integration costs and related merchandise inventory adjustments of $177 million ($110 million after tax or 21 cents per diluted share) and a gain of $54 million ($34 million after tax or 6 cents per diluted share) related to completion of the company's debt tender offer. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.60 for the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the full 52 weeks of fiscal 2007, Macy's, Inc. reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.01 per share, compared with $1.80 per share for the full 53 weeks of fiscal 2006. Excluding May Company merger integration costs of $219 million ($138 million after tax or 31 cents per diluted share) and the tax settlement of $78 million (17 cents per diluted share), diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.15 for fiscal 2007.

"While a weakened economic environment led our industry to softer financial results than initially expected, Macy's, Inc. did outperform most of our primary competitors in the fourth quarter. We also generated significant cash flow despite weaker-than-expected sales trends. Going forward, we are aggressively pursuing our recently announced market localization initiative to drive future sales and earnings," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc.
"In total, 2007 was a year of significant strategic progress as we successfully launched exclusive new brands such as Martha Stewart Collection, invested for continued growth in the direct-to-consumer businesses, expanded Bloomingdale's, changed our corporate name, and launched a breakthrough new marketing approach under the umbrella of The Magic of Macy's."
 Sales
Sales in the 13-week fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $8.594 billion, a decrease of 6.2 percent compared to total sales of $9.159 billion in the 14-week fourth quarter of 2006. On a same-store basis, the company's fourth quarter sales were down 2.0 percent.
The company's total sales for the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007 were $26.313 billion, down 2.4 percent  from total sales of $26.970 billion in the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s annual sales were down 1.3 percent.

Cash Flow
Macy's, Inc. generated $2.231 billion in cash from continuing operating activities in fiscal 2007, compared to $3.692 billion, or $1.832 billion excluding the $1.860 billion in proceeds from the sale of proprietary accounts receivable, in fiscal 2006.
