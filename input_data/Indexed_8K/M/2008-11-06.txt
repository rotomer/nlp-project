FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES DOWN 6.3% IN OCTOBER
Company reiterates fall season same-store sales guidance
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 6, 2008 - Macy's, Inc. today
reported total sales of $1.721 billion for the four weeks ended Nov. 1, 2008, a decrease of 6.9 percent compared to total sales of $1.849 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were down 6.3 percent in October.
 
For the third quarter of 2008, the company's total sales were $5.500 billion, a decrease of 6.9 percent compared to total sales of $5.906 billion in the same 13-week period last year. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s third-quarter sales were down 6.0 percent.
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $16.965 billion, down 4.3 percent from total sales of $17.719 billion in the first 39 weeks of 2007. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were down 3.5 percent. (Note that same-store sales for each month of fiscal 2008 are posted on www.macysinc.com/investors.)
 
The company reiterated its guidance for same-store sales in the fall season of 2008 (third and fourth quarters combined) to be down by 3 to 6 percent. Given third quarter results, same-store sales in the fourth quarter therefore are expected to be down by 1 to 6 percent. Because of a dramatic year-over-year calendar shift that resulted in a same-store sales increase of 13.4 percent in November 2007, the company expects a same-store decrease in the low double digits in November 2008 as a full week of sales shifts back into the December period.
 
The company is slated to report its third quarter earnings on Wednesday, Nov. 12, and
will webcast a call with financial analysts that day at 10:30 a.m. (ET). The webcast
is accessible to the media and general public either via the company's Web site at
www.macysinc.com or by calling in on 1-888-684-1262 (913-312-0975 for international
callers) passcode 5642242.
