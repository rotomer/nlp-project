FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 12, 2008 - Macy's, Inc. today reported a loss of 10 cents per diluted share for the third quarter of 2008, ended Nov. 1, 2008, compared with diluted earnings per share of 8 cents for the same 13-week period last year. Excluding division consolidation costs of $16 million ($10 million after tax or 2 cents per diluted share), the third quarter 2008 loss was 8 cents per diluted share. The third quarter of 2007 included May Company merger integration costs of $17 million ($10 million after tax or 2 cents per diluted share). Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 10 cents for the third quarter of 2007.
The company also reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2008 earnings to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.50 per diluted share ($1.10 to $1.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter), excluding one-time division consolidation costs and asset impairment charges. Same-store sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of down 1 to 6 percent. If deteriorating sales trends from the latter half of the third quarter continue through the fourth quarter, sales and earnings are expected to be toward the lower end of the guidance range.
Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Within this poor economic environment, Macy's, Inc. continues to outperform most of our major competitors in same-store sales. This gives us confidence in our strategies for gaining market share, particularly as the My Macy's localization initiative is yielding promising early results and in that we expect My Macy's to have a more profound impact in 2009. Thus we are staying focused on our priorities for offering unique and differentiated merchandise assortments, delivering great value and service to our customers, and reaching out with creative marketing that positions Macy's and Bloomingdale's as preferred shopping destinations for the holidays. This includes our distinctive 'Believe' campaign for Macy's and our 'Oh What Fun' campaign for Bloomingdale's.
"Macy's, Inc. remains financially healthy, with strong cash flow, a solid balance sheet and ample borrowing capacity. We are committed to continuing to aggressively manage expenses and inventories consistent with planned sales levels. In recognition of the weak economy, we reduced our budget for 2009 capital expenditures from approximately $1 billion to a range of $550 million to $600 million, compared with approximately $950 million in 2008," Lundgren said.
            For the first three quarters of 2008, Macy's, Inc. reported a loss from continuing operations of 7 cents per diluted share, compared with earnings of 35 cents per share in the first three quarters of 2007. Results for the first three quarters of 2008 include two unusual items (described below) that negatively impacted earnings by 27 cents per diluted share. Excluding these items, the company earned 20 cents per diluted share from continuing operations in the first three quarters of 2008.
            The first unusual item relates to the consolidation of three Macy's divisions announced in February 2008, which is expected to save approximately $100 million per year beginning in 2009 (approximately $60 million in savings for the partial year in 2008). In the first three quarters of 2008, the company booked consolidation costs of $129 million ($81 million after tax or 19 cents per diluted share). Year-to-date 2008 results also include non-cash asset impairment charges of $50 million ($31 million after tax or 8 cents per diluted share) related to private brand tradenames acquired in the merger with The May Department Stores Company in 2005.
In the first three quarters of 2007, Macy's, Inc. earned 55 cents per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding May Company merger integration costs of $150 million ($93 million after tax or 20 cents per diluted share).
Sales
            Sales in the third quarter of 2008 totaled $5.493 billion, a decrease of 7.0 percent, compared with sales of $5.906 billion in the same period last year. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s third quarter sales were down 6.0 percent.
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $16.958 billion, down 4.3 percent from total sales of $17.719 billion in the first 39 weeks of 2007. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were down 3.5 percent.
In the third quarter of 2008, the company reopened a Macy's store in the New Orleans market following the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and opened a second Macy's store in the New Orleans market, a new Macy's store in Tampa, FL, and a new Macy's furniture gallery in Portland, OR. The company temporarily closed three Macy's stores in the Houston, TX, market that were damaged by Hurricane Ike.
Operating Income
Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $68 million or 1.2 percent of sales for the quarter ended Nov. 1, 2008, compared with operating income of $183 million or 3.1 percent of sales for the same period last year. Macy's, Inc.'s third quarter 2008 operating income included $16 million in division consolidation costs. Excluding these costs, operating income for the third quarter of 2008 was $84 million or 1.5 percent of sales. Third quarter 2007 operating income included $17 million in May Company integration costs. Excluding these costs, operating income for the third quarter of 2007 was $200 million or 3.4 percent of sales.
For the first three quarters of 2008, Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $357 million or 2.1 percent of sales, compared to operating income of $641 million or 3.6 percent of sales for the same period last year. Macy's, Inc.'s operating income for the first three quarters of 2008 includes $129 million in division consolidation costs and $50 million in asset impairment charges. Excluding these items, operating income in the first three quarters of 2008 was $536 million or 3.2 percent of sales. Macy's, Inc.'s operating income for the first three quarters of 2007 was $791 million or 4.5 percent of sales, excluding $150 million in May Company integration costs.
 
Cash Flow
             Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $317 million in the first three quarters of 2008, compared with $285 million in the first nine months of last year. Net cash used by continuing investing activities in the first three quarters of 2008 was $606 million, compared with $618 million a year ago. In the first nine months of 2008, net cash used by continuing investing activities included $25 million from the disposal of property and equipment. In the first nine months of 2007, net cash used by continuing investing activities included $66 million in proceeds from the disposition of the After Hours formalwear business and $96 million from the disposal of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of duplicate facilities associated with the May Company integration. Net cash provided by continuing financing activities was $6 million in the first three quarters of 2008, compared with cash used by continuing financing activities of $602 million in the first three quarters of last year. In the second quarter of 2008, Macy's, Inc. issued $650 million in senior notes, and in the third quarter paid $650 million in matured senior notes. In the first nine months of 2007, net cash used by continuing financing activities included approximately $3 billion in stock repurchased, as well as approximately $2.9 billion in debt issued.
Looking Ahead
The company reiterates its sales and earnings guidance provided on Oct. 10, 2008, while continuing to note that the uncertain direction of the economy makes predictions of future performance difficult. Same-store sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down in the range of 1 to 6 percent, which would result in same-store sales for the fall season (third and fourth quarters combined) down in the range of 3 to 6 percent, consistent with previous guidance. Because of a dramatic year-over-year calendar shift that resulted in a same-store sales increase of 13.4 percent in November 2007, the company expects a same-store decrease in the low double digits in November 2008 as a full week of sales shifts back into the December period.
The company currently expects earnings per share on a diluted basis of approximately $1.10 to $1.30 in the fourth quarter, excluding one-time division consolidation costs, which would calculate to $1.30 to $1.50 for fiscal 2008 as a whole, excluding one-time division consolidation costs and impairment charges. Sales and earnings are expected to track to the lower end of guidance in the fourth quarter if sales trends remain consistent with those in the latter half of the third quarter. The company expects to book approximately $20 million in division consolidation costs in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
Macy's, Inc., with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, is one of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2007 sales of $26.3 billion.
