FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES DOWN 9.1% IN APRIL
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 7, 2009  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.692 billion for the four weeks ended May 2, 2009, a decrease of 9.4 percent compared with total sales of $1.868 billion in the four weeks ended May 3, 2008. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were down 9.1 percent in April. This is consistent with management's expectations.
 
For the 13-week first quarter and year to date, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $5.200 billion, down 9.5 percent from total sales of $5.747 billion in the first 13 weeks of 2008. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s first quarter sales were down 9.0 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 14.5 percent in April and 16.2 percent for the first quarter of 2009 and positively affected the Company's first quarter 2009 same-store sales by 0.5 percentage points. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
 
Macy's, Inc. said it expects a first quarter net loss of 19 cents to 21 cents per diluted share, excluding restructuring-related costs. This is better than the company's expectations and current Wall Street estimates. Given the continued uncertainty in the macro-economic environment, management believes it is prudent to maintain its annual guidance for fiscal 2009 at the current level of 40 cents to 55 cents per diluted share, excluding restructuring-related costs. The company expects it will exceed this guidance if the economy improves in the second half of the year.
 
Macy's, Inc. is slated to report its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, May 13, and
will webcast a call with financial analysts and investors that day at 10:30 a.m. (ET).
