FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. REPORTS STRONG FOURTH QUARTER
RESULTS THAT EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
Diluted fourth quarter EPS is $1.10; $1.40 excluding unusual items;
Company expects further improvement in 2010 as My Macy's continues to show results
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 23, 2010  Macy's, Inc. today reported improved fourth quarter results that exceeded expectations and represented a strong ending to the fiscal year. In addition, the company provided initial guidance that anticipates further improvement in sales and earnings in 2010.
 
"Our company initiated unprecedented change in 2009 as we adopted a unified organization structure and rolled out our My Macy's localization strategy amid the worst economic environment in decades. Despite these obstacles, we improved our profitability over the previous year through better-than-expected sales, improved gross margins and reduced expenses. We also continued to generate significant cash flow and ended the year with cash on hand of more than $1.6 billion after reducing debt by more than $950 million in 2010," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc.
 
"The fourth quarter represented a clear-cut improvement in sales trends from earlier in the year, driven by success from My Macy's, a 26.6 percent increase in online sales and a significant rebound at Bloomingdale's. We outperformed most of our major competitors in the all-important holiday season. We believe this momentum will continue in 2010 as we challenge our very talented organization, which is energized and focused, to further improve sales and earnings. While we still see little meaningful near-term improvement in macro-economic conditions, we do believe there is opportunity to gain market share by increasing same-store sales," Lundgren said. 
 
Earnings were $1.10 per diluted share for the 13-week fourth quarter of 2009, ended Jan. 30, 2010. These results include certain unusual items (described below) that negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $186 million or 30 cents per diluted share. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009. This exceeds the company's most recent guidance for fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.35 to $1.37, excluding restructuring-related costs. Original guidance for 2009 (provided Feb. 2, 2009) was for earnings per diluted share of 40 to 55 cents, excluding restructuring-related costs.
 
Unusual items in the fourth quarter of 2009 included $71 million ($48 million after tax or 11 cents per share) in costs and expenses associated with division consolidations and localization initiatives announced in February 2009, as well as with five store closings announced in January 2010, and $115 million ($79 million after tax or 19 cents per share) in asset impairment charges related to properties held and used.
 
Included in fourth quarter earnings is a non-cash credit resulting from the settlement of the company's federal income tax examinations for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.  The credit, which is primarily attributable to the disposition of former subsidiaries, reduced income tax expense by $21 million and contributed 5 cents per diluted share to fourth quarter earnings. This amount was included in the company's most recent guidance for fiscal 2009.
 
For the full 52 weeks of fiscal 2009, Macy's, Inc. reported diluted earnings per share of 83 cents per share. Excluding division consolidation and store closing costs of $276 million ($174 million after tax or 41 cents per diluted share) and asset impairment charges of $115 million ($73 million after tax or 17 cents per diluted share), diluted earnings per share were $1.41 for fiscal 2009.
 
In fiscal 2009, the company recorded $276 million, primarily in cash, in restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives announced in February 2009 and the store closings announced in January 2010. In addition, non-cash asset impairment charges of $115 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Initially, the company estimated $400 million in restructuring-related costs (including $30 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2008).
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Macy's, Inc. lost $11.33 per diluted share. These results included certain unusual items (described below) that negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $12.39 per diluted share. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Unusual items in the fourth quarter of 2008 included $5.382 billion ($5.083 billion after tax or $12.06 per diluted share) in goodwill impairment charge, $58 million ($36 million after tax or 9 cents per diluted share) in costs and expenses associated with division consolidations and localization initiatives announced in February 2008 and February 2009, as well as with costs and expenses associated with 11 store closings announced in January 2009, and $161 million ($102 million after tax or 24 cents per diluted share) in non-cash asset impairment charges related to store properties still in operation, store closings announced in January 2009, acquired private brand tradenames and the company's investment in The Knot.
 
For the full 52 weeks of fiscal 2008, Macy's, Inc. reported a loss of $11.40 per diluted share. Excluding goodwill impairment charges of $5.382 billion ($5.083 billion after tax or $12.06 per diluted share), division consolidation and store closing costs of $187 million ($118 million after tax or 28 cents per diluted share) and asset impairment charges of $211 million ($133 million after tax or 32 cents per diluted share), diluted earnings per share were $1.26 for fiscal 2008.

Notes:
 
(1)  Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method.  Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 or January 31, 2009.   
 
(2)  For the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, includes $65 million of restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidations and localization initiatives announced in February 2009, primarily severance and other human resource-related costs, and $6 million of costs and expenses related to the store closings announced in January 2010.  For the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009, included $17 million of restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidations and localization initiatives announced in February 2008, primarily severance and other human resource-related costs, $30 million of severance costs associated with the division consolidations and localization initiatives announced in February 2009, and $11 million of costs and expenses related to the store closings announced in January 2009.  For the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, these costs amounted to $.11 and $.09 per diluted share, respectively.
 
(3) For the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, includes $115 million of asset impairment charges related to properties held and used, $10 million of which is related to the store closings announced in January 2010.  For the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009, included $96 million of asset impairment charges related to properties held and used, $40 million of asset impairment charges related to the store closings announced in January 2009, $13 million of asset impairment charges associated with acquired indefinite lived private brand tradenames and $12 million of asset impairment charges associated with the Company's investment in The Knot.  For the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, these non-cash costs amounted to $.19 and $.24 per diluted share, respectively.
 
(4)  Represents a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $5,382 million, $5,083 million after income taxes, or $12.06 per diluted share, based on results of the goodwill impairment testing as of January 31, 2009.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test involved estimating the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units based on its estimated discounted cash flows and comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  The second step of the goodwill impairment test required the Company to allocate the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit's net assets, with any fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets representing the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. 
 
(5)  Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, the effect of state and local taxes and the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.  Income tax expense for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 reflects approximately $21 million, or $.05 per diluted share, of tax benefits related to the settlement of federal income tax examinations, primarily attributable to the disposition of former subsidiaries.
