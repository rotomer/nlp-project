FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF 35 CENTS
PER DILUTED SHARE, RAISES FULL-YEAR PROFIT GUIDANCE
Q2 sales, earnings and cash flow exceed expectations
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, August 11, 2010  Macy's, Inc.
today reported earnings of 35 cents per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010, ended July 31, 2010. This significant earnings increase over the second quarter of last year was driven by higher-than-expected sales, improved margins, a reduced expense rate and disciplined inventory management.
 
"We believe our business is beginning to hit its stride after implementing significant structural and organizational changes over the past two years. While the economic environment remains uncertain, Macy's and Bloomingdale's have a terrific opportunity to continue to take market share and grow our business profitably," said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"The improvement in our business is not the result of a single factor. Rather, our performance reflects a number of strategic initiatives that are working successfully and complementing each other. This includes My Macy's localization of merchandise assortments, centralization of key Macy's organizational functions, customer centricity activity, continued development of private brands, introduction of new exclusive market brands, improvement in associate selling and service skills, and integration of stores and online channels at Macy's and Bloomingdale's," he added. "We are entering the fall season with tremendous momentum that has energized the exceptionally talented people in our company. We are motivated to continue to innovate, test new ideas, accelerate the penetration of distinctive and exclusive merchandise, and tailor our offering to the diverse customers who shop in our stores and online."
 
In the second quarter of 2009, Macy's, Inc. earned 2 cents per diluted share. These results include restructuring charges of $34 million ($77 million after tax; 18 cents per share) related to division consolidations and localization initiatives. Excluding these charges, the company earned 20 cents per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.
 
For the first half of 2010, Macy's, Inc.'s diluted earnings per share were 40 cents, compared with a loss of 19 cents per diluted share in the first half of 2009. Excluding restructuring-related costs of $172 million ($97 million after tax; 23 cents per diluted share), earnings were 4 cents per diluted share in the first half of 2009.
 
Sales
 
$5.537 billion, up 7.2 percent from total sales of $5.164 billion in the second quarter of 2009. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s second quarter sales were up 4.9 percent.
Sales in the second quarter totaled
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $11.111 billion, up 7.2 percent from total sales of $10.363 billion in the first 26 weeks of 2009. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were up 5.2 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 28.1 percent in the second quarter and 31.0 percent in the first half of 2010. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 0.5 percentage points in the second quarter and 0.8 percentage points in the year to date. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.

Looking Ahead
 
Macy's, Inc. currently expects same-store sales in the second half of fiscal 2010 to be up in the range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, which would result in full-year 2010 same-store sales to be up between 4 percent and 4.2 percent. At the beginning of the year, the company's initial guidance was for a 2010 same-store sales increase of 1 percent to 2 percent. At the end of the first quarter, full-year same-store sales guidance was raised to up 3 percent to 3.5 percent, reflecting improvement in the business trend.
 
Based on stronger sales expectations, Macy's, Inc. is increasing its full-year 2010 earnings guidance to $1.85 to $1.90 per diluted share. This compares with previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.80 per diluted share, and initial earnings guidance of $1.55 to $1.60 per diluted share provided at the beginning of the year.

Notes:
 
(1)  Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2010 and August 1, 2009 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. 
 
(2)  Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2010 or August 1, 2009.   
 
(3)  Represents restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives, primarily severance and other human resource related costs. For 13 weeks ended August 1, 2009, restructuring-related costs associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives announced in February 2009 amounted to $77 million after tax or $.18 per diluted share.
 
(4)  Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.

(3)  Represents restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives, primarily severance and other human resource related costs. For the 26 weeks ended August 1, 2009, restructuring-related costs associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives announced in February 2009 amounted to $97 million after tax or $.23 per diluted share.
 
(4)  Interest expense for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2010, includes approximately $27 million of expenses associated with the early retirement of approximately $500 million of outstanding debt.
 
(5)  Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Additionally, income tax expense for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2010 reflects a $4 million reduction of deferred tax assets due to the enactment of recent healthcare reform legislation. The reduction was required as a result of the elimination of the deductibility of retiree health care payments to the extent of tax-free Medicare Part D subsidies that are received. The change in deductibility is effective February 3, 2013.
