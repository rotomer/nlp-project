MACY'S, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
OF 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE
Q3 earnings were 8 cents per diluted share, excluding expenses associated with debt repurchase
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 10, 2010  Macy's, Inc.
today reported continued strong financial results for the third quarter of 2010, with sales, earnings and cash flow that exceeded the company's expectations. Earnings were 2 cents per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010, ended Oct. 30, 2010. This compares with a loss of 8 cents per share in last year's third quarter.
 
Third quarter 2010 results included 6 cents per diluted share of expenses associated with the repurchase of debt in the third quarter. Third quarter 2009 results included 5 cents per diluted share of restructuring costs related to division consolidations and localization initiatives. Excluding these items from both periods, earnings were 8 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010, compared with a loss of 3 cents per diluted share in the third quarter last year.
 
"Throughout 2010, we have gained confidence and momentum as customers have responded favorably to our execution of key strategies developed and activated over the past few years. This bodes well for our business as we enter the holiday selling season with a differentiated and tailored merchandise offering, compelling marketing, and an energized organization of store associates focused on engaging customers," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "We are proud of the results we have generated as My Macy's has firmly taken root, creating a leading nationwide brand with a local focus in each market. Simultaneously, Bloomingdale's has aggressively capitalized on the return of the upscale customer and has reinforced its reputation for extraordinary contemporary fashion and service. Both brands remain in the early stages of benefiting from an enhanced omnichannel approach that integrates the offerings of Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, online sites, mobile technology and social media.
 
"We are productively using the significant amount of cash being generated by our business to further strengthen our balance sheet. In 2010, we have retired a total of more than $1.2 billion of debt using excess cash. This includes $1 billion in repurchase transactions on the open market in the first and third quarters, as previously announced," Lundgren said.   
 
For the first three quarters of 2010, Macy's, Inc.'s diluted earnings per share were 42 cents, compared with a loss of 27 cents per diluted share in the first three quarters of 2009. Excluding 10 cents per share of expenses associated with the repurchase of debt in the first and third quarters, earnings were 52 cents per diluted share in the first three quarters of 2010. Excluding 28 cents per diluted share of restructuring costs related to division consolidations and localization initiatives, earnings were 1 cent per diluted share in the first three quarters of 2009.

Looking Ahead
 
Last week (on Nov. 4, 2010) Macy's, Inc. provided increased guidance for the second half of 2010. The company's guidance is for same-store sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be up 3 percent to 4 percent.

Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)
 
Notes:
 
(1)  Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. 
 
(2)  Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2010 or October 31, 2009.   
 
(3)  Represents restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives, primarily severance and other human resource related costs. For 13 weeks ended October 31, 2009, restructuring-related costs associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives announced in February 2009 amounted to $23 million after tax or $.05 per diluted share.
(4)  Interest expense for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2010, includes approximately $39 million on a pre-tax basis, or $24 million after tax or $.06 per diluted share, of expenses associated with the early retirement of approximately $500 million of outstanding debt.
 
(5)  Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.

(3)  Represents restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives, primarily severance and other human resource related costs. For the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2009, restructuring-related costs associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives announced in February 2009 amounted to $120 million after tax or $.28 per diluted share.
 
(4)  Interest expense for the 39 weeks ended October 30, 2010, includes approximately $66 million on a pre-tax basis, or $41 million after tax or $.10 per diluted share, of expenses associated with the early retirement of approximately $1,000 million of outstanding debt.
 
(5)  Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Additionally, income tax expense for the 39 weeks ended October 30, 2010 reflects a $4 million reduction of deferred tax assets due to the enactment of recent healthcare reform legislation. The reduction was required as a result of the elimination of the deductibility of retiree health care payments to the extent of tax-free Medicare Part D subsidies that are received. The change in deductibility is effective February 3, 2013.
