FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES UP 2.6% IN JANUARY
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, February 3, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.310 billion for the four weeks ended Jan. 29, 2011, an increase of 4.6 percent compared with total sales of $1.253 billion in the four weeks ended Jan. 30, 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were up 2.6 percent in January.
 
For the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $8.270 billion, up 5.4 percent from total sales of $7.849 billion for the final 13 weeks of 2009. On a same-store basis, the company's fourth quarter sales were up 4.3 percent. This is on the high end of the company's guidance for fourth quarter same-store sales to be up between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent.
 
For fiscal 2010 as a whole, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $25.004 billion, up 6.5 percent from total sales of $23.489 billion in fiscal 2009. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s fiscal 2010 sales were up 4.6 percent.
 
"January represented a successful conclusion to a great year of sales growth at Macy's, Inc.  While sales in January were restrained by the series of snowstorms that caused widespread store closings along the East Coast and in the Southeast U.S., we continued to benefit from the underlying strength in our business," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc.   
 
"Same-store sales for fiscal 2010 were above plan and above 2009 in every Macy's region, as well as at Bloomingdale's. When we entered the year, our initial guidance was for 2010 same-store sales to be up between 1 percent and 2 percent. Our actual performance  same-store sales growth of 4.6 percent  was a remarkable achievement in a period of economic uncertainty. This strong performance in 2010 was possible because of successful implementation of key strategies, including My Macy's localization, omnichannel integration of our stores and online businesses, and continued emphasis on fresh, distinctive and exclusive merchandise that appeals to fashion-oriented customers. These are all strategies that will continue to drive our growth in 2011," Lundgren said.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 27.2 percent in January, 29.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 28.7 percent for fiscal 2010. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter and 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2010 as a whole. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
