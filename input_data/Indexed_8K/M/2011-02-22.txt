, Ohio, February 22, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported significantly improved results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2010. The company also provided initial guidance that anticipates further growth in sales and earnings in 2011, which reflects the continued benefits from consistent implementation of key strategies.
 
"Fiscal 2010 was a very successful year for Macy's and Bloomingdale's based on a combination of strong sales, steady margins and continued expense discipline. Our operating income rose 32 percent over the previous year, factoring out various items," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "A successful holiday selling period in 2010 reinforced the effectiveness of our talented team, our unique organizational structure and the process that has transformed Macy's, Inc. to a culture of growth.
 
"We believe that our company is now on a clear path that will lead to continued growth in sales, earnings and cash flow in the years ahead. We remain in the early phases of implementing several key strategies  localizing assortments through My Macy's, embracing customer centricity and driving omnichannel integration," Lundgren said. "We have a focused, energized and experienced organization that has seen the initial success of these initiatives and we now are pursuing new ideas for further improvement and sharpened execution. We have entered 2011 with momentum and confidence that we believe will continue to result in great things for our customers, our associates, our vendor partners and our shareholders."   
 
Earnings were $1.55 per diluted share for the 13-week fourth quarter of 2010, ended Jan. 29, 2011.

Notes:
 
(1)  Certain reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform with the classifications of such amounts for the most recent period.
 
(2)  Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method.  Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010.
 
(3)  For the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011, includes $18 million of asset impairment charges and $7 million of other costs and expenses related to the store closings announced in January  2011.  For the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010, included $115 million of asset impairment charges, $6 million of costs and expenses related to the store closings announced in January 2010 and $65 million of restructuring-related costs and expenses associated with the division consolidation and localization initiatives, primarily severance and other human resource-related costs.  For the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, these costs amounted to $.04 and $.30 per diluted share, respectively.
 
(4)  The Company changed its methodology for recording deferred state income taxes from a blended rate basis to a separate entity basis, and has reflected the effects of such change to 2010 and all prior periods.  Even though the Company considers the change to have had only an immaterial impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, results of operations for the prior period as previously reported have been adjusted to reflect the change.  The effects of the change on the previously reported 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 results include an increase in non-cash tax expense of $21 million and a decrease in net income of $21 million, or $.05 per diluted share, as well as immaterial adjustments to certain balance sheet and cash flow items.  Had the change not been in effect for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011, reported income tax expense would have been $9 million higher and net income would have been $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, lower.
 
In addition, federal, state and local income taxes also differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.  Income tax expense for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2010 reflected approximately $21 million, or $.05 per diluted share, of tax benefits related to the settlement of federal income tax examinations, primarily attributable to the disposition of former subsidiaries.
