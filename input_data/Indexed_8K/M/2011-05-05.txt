FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES UP 10.8% IN APRIL
Company exceeds expectations with 5.3% same-store sales growth
in March-April and 5.4% same-store sales growth in Q1
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 5, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.924 billion for the four weeks ended April 30, 2011, an increase of 10.9 percent compared with total sales of $1.735 billion in the four weeks ended May 1, 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were up 10.8 percent in April. This exceeds guidance for April sales to be up by 8 percent to 9 percent.
 
As previously reported, a late Easter in 2011 shifted some sales into April and out of the March reporting period. For March-April combined, same-store sales were up 5.3 percent in 2011. This exceeds March-April same-store sales guidance, which initially was for an increase of 3 percent, then raised on April 7 to a range of 4 to 4.5 percent.
 
"April was another strong month for our company. Macy's and Bloomingdale's both performed well in stores and online. As a result, we also exceeded our own aggressive expectations for the combined March-April period and for the first quarter," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "Sales throughout the quarter were especially robust in southern climate zones, which bodes well for our spring fashion offering as the weather becomes warmer and drier in northern markets. We continue to be encouraged and confident with the ongoing implementation of key strategies, such as My Macy's localization and omnichannel integration that allows us to serve customers' needs whenever and however they chose to shop from inventory no matter where it exists across the company."
 
For the first quarter, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $5.892 billion, up 5.7 percent from total sales of $5.574 billion in the first 13 weeks of 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s first quarter sales were up 5.4 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 50.3 percent in April and 38.3 percent in the first quarter. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.3 percentage points in the first quarter. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
 
Macy's, Inc. is slated to report its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, May 11, and will webcast a call with financial analysts
and investors that day at 10:30 a.m. (ET). Macys, Inc.'s webcast is accessible to the media and general public via the company's
