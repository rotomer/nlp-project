FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER
EARNINGS OF 30 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE
Company doubles quarterly dividend, raises FY2011 sales and earnings guidance
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 11, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported strong sales, earnings and cash flow for the first quarter of 2011. Earnings for the quarter were 30 cents per diluted share, compared with 5 cents per diluted share last year.
 
The company also announced today that its board of directors has doubled the quarterly dividend on Macy's common stock to 10 cents per share. The dividend of 10 cents per share is payable July 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2011. The company's previous dividend had been 5 cents per quarter.
 
"We are building a culture of growth at Macy's, Inc. Our performance cannot be attributed to a single factor, but rather to the coordinated execution of a series of complementary customer-centric strategies. In the first quarter, we benefitted from strong topline sales, disciplined margin and expense management, improved credit performance and lower interest expense," said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Based on the strength, momentum and confidence in our business, we are doubling the dividend as a step in returning value directly to our shareholders," Lundgren said. "Our confidence derives from our belief that we remain in the early innings of implementation of our current strategies  My Macy's localization, enhanced sales training, exclusive and differentiated merchandise, and omnichannel integration that positions Macy's and Bloomingdale's to serve customer needs seamlessly in stores, online and via mobile technology. We also are developing and testing a wide range of new ideas and innovations that will allow us to evolve with our customers and continue to improve our performance."
 
Earnings of 30 cents per diluted share for the 13-week first quarter of 2011, ended April 30, compared to 5 cents per diluted share of the 13-week first quarter of 2010, ended May 1. The year-ago first quarter results included $27 million ($17 million after tax; 4 cents per diluted share) in premium and fees related to debt repurchase activity. Excluding these charges, the company earned 9 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.

Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)
 
Notes:
 
(1)
  
Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. 
 
(2)
  
Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2011 or May 1, 2010.   
 
(3)
  
Interest expense for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2010, included approximately $27 million on a pre-tax basis, or $17 million after tax or $.04 per diluted share, of expenses associated with the early retirement of approximately $500 million of outstanding debt.
 
(4)
  
Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Additionally, income tax expense for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2010 reflected a $4 million reduction of deferred tax assets due to the enactment of healthcare reform legislation. The reduction was required as a result of the elimination of the deductibility of retiree health care payments to the extent of tax-free Medicare Part D subsidies that are received. The change in deductibility is effective February 3, 2013.

Notes: 
 
The Company changed its methodology for recording deferred state income taxes from a blended rate basis to a separate entity basis, and reflected the effects of such change in 2010 and retroactively to 2008. Even though the Company considered the change to have had only an immaterial impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, the financial condition for the prior period as previously reported has been adjusted to reflect the change.
