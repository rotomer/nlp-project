FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES UP 5.0% IN JULY
Second quarter same-store sales rise 6.4%, exceed expectations
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, August 4, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.612 billion for the four weeks ended July 30, 2011, an increase of 5.7 percent compared with total sales of $1.525 billion in the four weeks ended July 31, 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were up 5.0 percent in July.
 
"Our July sales performance once again exceeded our expectations and represented a continuation of the balanced success we have seen throughout the year. Store and online sales throughout the second quarter continued to be strong at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. This is especially encouraging given the comparison to our robust same-store sales performance in July and second quarter last year," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "In particular, sales have been driven by fresh, interesting and distinctive merchandise assortments that deliver value to our customer. The company's performance is clearly benefitting from a re-energized, customer-focused growth culture that has embraced our strategies for localization, omnichannel integration and enhanced selling skills among our associates."
 
For the second quarter of 2011, the company's total sales were $5.940 billion, up 7.3 percent from total sales of $5.537 billion in the same 13-week period last year. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s second quarter sales were up 6.4 percent. This exceeded the company's increased guidance, provided July 7, for second quarter sales to increase by approximately 6 percent. (Initial guidance, provided May 11, was for second quarter sales to rise by approximately 4 percent.)
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $11.829 billion, up 6.5 percent from total sales of $11.111 billion in the first 26 weeks of 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were up 5.9 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 36.7 percent in July, 40.2 percent in the second quarter and 39.2 percent in the first half of 2011. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.2 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.3 percentage points in the year to date. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
