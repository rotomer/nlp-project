MACY'S, INC. REPORTS EARNINGS OF 55 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF 57%
Q2 sales, earnings and cash flow exceed expectations; company raises full-year guidance
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, August 10, 2011  Macy's, Inc.
today reported earnings of 55 cents per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011, ended July 30, 2011. This represents a 57 percent increase in earnings per share from earnings of 35 cents per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Sales, operating income, net income and cash flow all exceeded expectations in the most recent quarter, as well as in the first half of 2011.
 
"This was our most successful second quarter and spring season in more than a decade. Importantly, it came on top of an impressive first half performance last year. To date this year, we have driven significant additional sales growth, gained market share, maintained strong margins, managed expenses and generated a very healthy level of cash," said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We have moved quickly to establish a culture of growth at Macy's, Inc. since reorganizing the company in 2008 and 2009, and yet we feel we are just beginning to take advantage of the benefits we envision.
 
"All of our key strategies are working - and working in unison - to help us better understand our customers, deliver the assortments and value they want and expect, and engage them in stores, online and via mobile devices with a shopping experience that is convenient and compelling. Our Macy's and Bloomingdale's brands are continuing to evolve, testing new ideas and developing the extraordinary level of talent and expertise within our company. All of these factors have helped us to overcome an economic environment that remains sluggish. As we continue to closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets, we are cautious but optimistic about this fall and are staying focused on those factors we can control," Lundgren said.
 
For the first half of 2011, Macy's, Inc.'s diluted earnings per share were 86 cents, an increase of 115 percent compared with earnings of 40 cents per share in the first half of 2010.
 
Sales
 
Sales in the second quarter totaled $5.939 billion, up 7.3 percent from total sales of $5.537 billion in the second quarter of 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s second quarter sales were up 6.4 percent.
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $11.828 billion, up 6.5 percent from total sales of $11.111 billion in the first 26 weeks of 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were up 5.9 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 40.2 percent in the second quarter and 39.2 percent in the first half of 2011. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.2 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.3 percentage points in the year to date. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
 
The company opened no new stores in the first half of 2011, and reopened a Macy's store in Warwick, RI, following flood damage in 2010. The company closed a Macy's furniture gallery in San Antonio, TX, and a furniture clearance center in Naperville, IL. Both businesses were transitioned into nearby Macy's stores. In the second half of 2011, the company is opening three new Bloomingdale's Outlet stores, as previously announced.
 
Operating Income
 
Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $506 million or 8.5 percent of sales for the quarter ended July 30, 2011, compared with operating income of $370 million or 6.7 percent of sales for the same period last year.
 
For the first half of 2011, Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $836 million or 7.1 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $573 million or 5.2 percent of sales for the same period last year.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $587 million in the first half of 2011, compared with $288 million in the first six months of last year. This includes a funding contribution to the company's pension plan of $225 million in the first half of 2011, compared with $325 million in the first half of 2010. Net cash used by investing activities in the first half of 2011 was $222 million, compared with $124 million a year ago. Net cash used by financing activities in the first six months of 2011 was $334 million, including $337 million used to repay debt. In the first half of 2010, net cash used by financing activities was $642 million, including $584 million used to repay debt. An additional $109 million in debt is scheduled to mature on Sept. 15, 2011.
 
Looking Ahead
 
Macy's, Inc. currently expects same-store sales in the second half of fiscal 2011 to be up between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, which would result in full-year 2011 same-store sales being up between 4.8 percent and 5.1 percent. At the beginning of the year, the company's initial guidance was for a 2011 same-store sales increase of approximately 3 percent. In July, full-year same-store sales guidance was raised to an increase of approximately 4.8 percent, reflecting improvement in the business trend.
 
Macy's, Inc. is increasing its full-year 2011 earnings guidance to $2.60 to $2.65 per diluted share, including $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share in the second half of 2011. This compares with previous full-year guidance of $2.40 to $2.45 per diluted share, and initial earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.30 per diluted share provided at the beginning of the year.
 
Macy's, Inc., with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, is one of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2010 sales of $25 billion. The company operates about 850 department stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico under the names of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as well as the macys.com and bloomingdales.com websites. The company also operates four Bloomingdale's Outlet stores.

Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)
 
Notes:
 
(1)
  
Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. 
 
(2)
  
Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2011 or July 31, 2010.   
 
(3)
  
Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.

Interest expense for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2010, included approximately $27 million on a pre-tax basis, or $17 million after tax or $.04 per diluted share, of expenses associated with the early retirement of approximately $500 million of outstanding debt.
 
(4)
  
Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Additionally, income tax expense for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2010 reflected a $4 million reduction of deferred tax assets due to the enactment of healthcare reform legislation. The reduction was required as a result of the elimination of the deductibility of retiree health care payments to the extent of tax-free Medicare Part D subsidies that are received. The change in deductibility is effective February 3, 2013.

Notes: 
 
The Company changed its methodology for recording deferred state income taxes from a blended rate basis to a separate entity basis, and reflected the effects of such change in 2010 and retroactively to 2008.  Even though the Company considered the change to have had only an immaterial impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, the financial condition for the prior period as previously reported has been adjusted to reflect the change.
