FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S, INC. SAME-STORE SALES UP 2.2% IN OCTOBER
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 3, 2011  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.842 billion for the four weeks ended Oct. 29, 2011, an increase of 2.0 percent compared with total sales of $1.806 billion in the four weeks ended Oct. 30, 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were up 2.2 percent in October.
 
            (Editor's Note: Macy's, Inc. this morning also issued a separate news release announcing a new Bloomingdale's store location.)
 
"Our third quarter was within our initial guidance for same-store sales to be up between 4 percent and 4.5 percent. And as previously expected, October showed the smallest year-over-year growth rate of the quarter as we shifted Macy's popular Shop For A Cause event from October last year into August this year," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "Sales of cold-weather products such as coats, hats and sweaters were soft for most of October as the weather stayed unseasonable warm, but they began to normalize once temperatures turned cooler. Ironically, sales were negatively impacted by the snowstorm in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states last Saturday, the final sales day of the October period.
 
"We remain confident in our expectations for same-store sales in the fourth quarter to be up by 4 percent to 4.5 percent given our unique local assortments, strong omnichannel approach to the customer, enhanced selling skills in our stores organization, and a very creative and compelling marketing program," Lundgren said.
 
For the third quarter of 2011, the company's total sales were $5.853 billion, an increase of 4.1 percent compared with total sales of $5.623 billion in the same 13-week period last year. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s third-quarter sales were up 4.0 percent.
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $17.681 billion, up 5.7 percent from total sales of $16.734 billion in the first 39 weeks of 2010. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were up 5.3 percent.
 
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 39.2 percent in October, 39.8 percent in the third quarter and 39.4 percent in 2011 year-to-date. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.5 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.4 percentage points in the year to date. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
 
Macy's, Inc. is scheduled to report its third quarter earnings on Wednesday, Nov. 9, and will webcast a call with financial analysts and
investors that day at 10:30 a.m. (ET). Macy's, Inc.'s webcast is accessible to the media and general public via the company's website at
