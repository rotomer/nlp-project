On January 13, 2012, Macy's, Inc. ("Macy's") and its wholly owned subsidiary, Macy's Retail Holdings, Inc. ("Macy's Holdings"), entered into the Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), the First Supplemental Trust Indenture (the "First Supplemental Indenture") and the Second Supplemental Trust Indenture (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), each dated as of January 13, 2012, among Macy's Holdings, as issuer, Macy's, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, in connection with the offer and sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of Macy's Holdings' 3.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of Macy's Holdings' 5.125% Senior Notes due 2042, each of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Macy's.
Macy's Holdings will pay interest on the senior notes on each January 15 and July 15, beginning on July 15, 2012. The 3.875% Senior Notes due 2022 will mature on January 15, 2022 and the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2042 will mature on January 15, 2042. Before October 15, 2021, Macy's Holdings may, at any time, redeem the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series, plus a "make whole" premium described in the Indenture. On or after October 15, 2021, Macy's Holdings may redeem the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2022 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Before July 15, 2041, Macy's Holdings may, at any time, redeem the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2042 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series, plus a "make whole" premium described in the Indenture. On or after July 15, 2041, Macy's Holdings may redeem the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2042 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Upon the occurrence of both (i) a change of control of Macy's and (ii) within a specified period in relation to the change of control, a downgrade of the senior notes by at least two of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and being rated below an investment grade rating by at least two of such rating agencies, Macy's Holdings will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes of such series at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
The senior notes are subject to the covenants in the Indenture, which include limitations on liens, limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on sales of assets, and limitations on merger and consolidation.
The Indenture contains customary events of default, including: (a) failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any senior note when due; (b) failure to pay any interest on any senior note for 30 days after the interest becomes due; (c) failure to redeem or repurchase any senior note when required to do so; (d) Macy's Holdings' failure to perform, or its breach of, any other covenant in the Indenture for 60 days after written notice thereof; (e) nonpayment at maturity or other default (beyond any applicable grace period) under any agreement or instrument relating to any other indebtedness of Macy's Holdings or any of its restricted subsidiaries, the unpaid principal amount of which is not less than $100 million, which default results in the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness; (f) the entry of any final judgment or order against Macy's Holdings, Macy's or any of their restricted subsidiaries, which judgment or order creates a liability of $100 million or more in excess of insured amounts and which has not been stayed, vacated, discharged, or otherwise satisfied for a period of 60 days; (g) Macy's guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect; and (h) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving Macy's Holdings, Macy's or any significant subsidiary (or group of subsidiaries that would constitute a significant subsidiary) of Macy's or Macy's Holdings.
If an event of default resulting from specified events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, the Indenture provides that the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the senior notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the senior notes. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture provides that either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding senior notes may declare the principal amount of all the senior notes to be due and payable immediately.
The foregoing disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Base Indenture, First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2 and Exhibit 4.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

(b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss, or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost, or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
(c) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
(d) Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 2.07, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
(e) Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 2.07 in exchange for any mutilated Security or in lieu of any destroyed, lost, or stolen Security will constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and will be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
(f) The provisions of this Section 2.07 are exclusive and will preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen Securities.
 
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any sinking fund payment will, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and will be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered will be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities will be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section 2.08, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee will cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will destroy cancelled Securities (subject to applicable record retention requirements of the Exchange Act and the Trustee); provided that, in the case that the Trustee cannot destroy cancelled Securities because of applicable retention requirements of the Exchange Act and the Trustee, all Securities not so destroyed will be permanently and prominently marked by the Trustee as "cancelled". Upon cancellation of the Securities provided for in this Section 2.08, such Securities will be null, void and of no further force or effect. Certification of the cancellation of all cancelled Securities will be delivered to the Company upon request.
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 2.01 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
(b) Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company together with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by law) at the rate of interest applicable to such Security, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below:
(i) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which will be fixed in the following manner. The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company will deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) or will make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
 
entitled to such Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) as in this clause (i) provided. Thereupon the Trustee will fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) which will be not more than 15 calendar days and not less than 10 calendar days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 calendar days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee will promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, will cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest will be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and will no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii).
(ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest (and interest thereon, if any) on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause (ii), such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
(c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.09, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security will carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 2.09) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee will be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company in issuing any series of the Securities may use CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers, if then generally in use, and thereafter with respect to such series, the Trustee may use such numbers in any notice of redemption or exchange with respect to such series that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers.
provided
 
Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity will be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article III.
 
(a) The election of the Company to redeem any Securities will be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the Company will, at least 60 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company will furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
(b) Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company will be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and will be irrevocable. Notice of redemption will be given by mail, first-class postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption will state:
(i) the Redemption Date;
(ii) the Redemption Price;
(iii) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
(iv) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
 
(v) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(vi) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
(vii) the specific provision of this Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be redeemed.
(c) If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed will be selected not more than 60 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee may deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
(d) For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities will relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on any Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 6.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) any accrued interest on, all of the Securities that are to be redeemed on that date.
 
(a) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed will, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities will cease to accrue interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security will be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; , , that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates in accordance with their terms and the provisions of Section 2.09.
provided
however
 
(b) If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium will, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
Any Security that is to be redeemed only in part will be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company will execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
 
The provisions of this Article IV will be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 4.02. Each sinking fund payment with respect to Securities of a particular series will be applied to the redemption of Securities of such series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
 
The Company (a) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (b) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities will be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment will be reduced accordingly.
 
Not less than 60 calendar days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying
 
the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 4.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 calendar days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02(c) and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02(b). Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities will be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 3.04 and 3.05.
 
The Company may elect, at its option by Board Resolution at any time, to have either Section 5.02 or Section 5.03 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any series designated pursuant to Section 2.01 as being defeasible pursuant to this Article V (hereinafter called "Defeasible Series"), upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article V, provided that Section 5.02 will not apply to any series of Securities that is exchangeable into Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(xvi) or exchangeable for any other securities pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(xvii).
 
Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 5.01 to have this Section 5.02 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible Series and subject to the proviso to Section 5.01, the Company and the Guarantor will be deemed to have been discharged from their respective obligations with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this Section 5.02 on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 5.04 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under the Securities of such series and this Indenture insofar as the Securities of such series are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
(a) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 5.04 and as more fully set forth in Section 5.04, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities of such series when payments are due;
(b) the Company's obligations with respect to the Securities of such series under Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 6.02, 6.03, and 10.06;
(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, and immunities of the Trustee hereunder; and
 
(d) this Article V.
Subject to compliance with this Article V, the Company may exercise its option provided in Section 5.01 to have this Section 5.02 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible Series notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option provided in Section 5.01 to have Section 5.03 applied to the Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 5.01 to have this Section 5.03 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible Series:

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition, or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent specified above in the case of Section 8.01(a)(iv) or in any such specified provision of such supplemental indenture), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or provision or by reason of any reference in any such Section or provision to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of such series will be unaffected thereby.
 
The following will be the conditions to application of either Section 5.02 or Section 5.03 to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible Series:
(a) The Company or the Guarantor shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee that satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 9.08 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article V applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the benefit of the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series

(c) In the case of an election under Section 5.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (from a counsel who shall not be an employee of the Company) to the effect that the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to the Securities of such series and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner, and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.
(d) The Securities of such series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted solely as a result of such deposit and such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a material breach or violation of, or constitute a material default under, any material agreement to which the Company is a party or violate any law to which the Company is subject.
(e) No Event of Default or event that (after notice or lapse of time or both) would become an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit.
(f) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act).
(g) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants or other Person acceptable to the Trustee expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations without reinvestment plus any deposited money without investment will provide the cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay
 
the principal of and any premium and interest when due on the Securities of such series on the respective Stated Maturities or on any earlier date or dates on which the Securities of such series shall be subject to redemption at the option of the holder thereof.
(h) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
(i) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless such trust will be qualified under such Act or will be exempt from regulation thereunder.

(b) The Company will pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee, or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 5.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee, or other charge that by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Article V to the contrary, the Trustee will deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon a Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 5.04 with respect to Securities of any Defeasible Series that are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article V with respect to the Securities of any series by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining, or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article V
 
with respect to Securities of such series until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 5.05 with respect to Securities of such series in accordance with this Article V; , , that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

(b) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default arising under Section 8.01(a)(vii) or (viii)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) will become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a)(vii) or (viii) occurs, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

(ii) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 8.01(d).
No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (i) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article X cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
(a) The Company covenants that if (i) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 calendar days or (ii) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security when it becomes due and payable, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as will be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel.
(b) If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
(c) In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee will be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee will be authorized to collect and receive any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee consents to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 9.06.
(d) No provision of this Indenture will be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; , , that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.

No Holder of any Security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;

(d) the Trustee for 60 calendar days after its receipt of such notice, request, and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders will have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb, or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy will, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, will not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default will impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article VIII or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, that (a) such direction will not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

If a Default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee will give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such Default within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default; , , that in the case of any Default of the character specified in Section 8.01(a)(iv) with respect to Securities of such series no such notice to Holders will be given until at least 30 calendar days after the occurrence thereof. The Company will give the Trustee notice of any uncured Event of Default within 10 days after any Responsible Officer of the Company becomes aware of or receives actual notice of such Event of Default. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal or interest on any Security, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security will have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 2.09) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights may not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
 
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee, and the Holders will be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders will continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceeding relative to the Company or the Subsidiaries (or any other obligor upon the Securities), their creditors or their property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same, and any custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee hereunder. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

(j) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
(d) If, at any time, (i) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 9.07 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, (ii) the Trustee ceases to be eligible under Section 9.08 and fails to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (iii) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting or is adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property is appointed or any public officer takes charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation, or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or (B) subject to Section 8.07, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
(e) If the Trustee resigns, is removed, or becomes incapable of acting, or if a vacancy occurs in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company by a Board Resolution will promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there will be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and will comply with the applicable requirements of Section 9.10. If, within one year after such resignation, removal, or incapability or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series is appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed will, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 9.10, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 9.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, at the reasonable expense of the Company, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(f) The Company will give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 14.03. Each notice will include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed will execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed, or conveyance, will become
 
vested with all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee, but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee will execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Trustee and will duly assign, transfer, and deliver to such Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, provided all sums owing to it hereunder have been paid and subject to its lien provided for in Section 9.06.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee, and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series will execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein such successor Trustee will accept such appointment and which:
(i) will contain such provisions as may be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates;
(ii) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, will contain such provisions as may be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring will continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee; and
(iii) will add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as may be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture will constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee will be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed, or conveyance, will become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee will duly assign, transfer, and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company will execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all applicable rights, powers, and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 9.10.
(d) No successor Trustee will accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee is qualified and eligible under this Article IX.
 
Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to which the Trustee may be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee (including the administration of the trust created by this Indenture), will be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, such Person is otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article IX, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion, or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
provided
 
If and when the Trustee is or becomes a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee will be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
 
(a) The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which will be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer, or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 2.07, and Securities so authenticated will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and will be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference will be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50 million and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 9.13, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent will be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.13, such Authenticating Agent will resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section 9.13.
 
(b) Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent may be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, will continue to be an Authenticating Agent, such corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section 9.13, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
provided
(c) An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions this Section 9.13, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and will mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder will become vested with all the rights, powers, and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent will be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 9.13.
(d) The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section 9.13.
(e) If an appointment with respect to one or more series of Securities is made pursuant to this Section 9.13, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative form of certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken
 
or such omission shall be effective. In the case of any proposed action or omission expressly authorized by this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than three Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application by telecopy, e-mail, or otherwise (provided that such receipt shall have been confirmed by the Trustee), unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted. In the case of any proposed action or omission that is not expressly authorized by this Indenture, the Trustee shall not take or refrain from taking any action unless prior to taking or refraining from taking any such action, the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
 
Without the consent of or notice to any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, the Guarantor, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:

(b) to add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or the Guarantor;
(c) to add any additional Events of Default;
(d) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form;
(e) to add to, change, or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities, that any such addition, change, or elimination (i) will neither (A) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (B) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or (ii) will become effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding;
provided
 
(f) to allow any Person to guarantee, in whole or in part, any Obligations in respect of all or any series of Securities;
(g) to establish the terms or form of Securities and the Guarantee of any series as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 2.02;
(h) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as may be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 9.10; or
(i) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, that such action pursuant to this clause (i) will not adversely affect the legal rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect.
provided
 
(a) With the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, the Guarantor, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; , , that no such supplemental indenture will, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby:
provided
however
(i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 8.01(b), or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date);
(ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of which is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture; or
 
(iii) modify any of the provisions of this Section 10.02, Section 8.01(d) or Section 6.06, except to increase the percentage in principal amount of Holders required under any such Section or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby, , , that this clause (iii) will not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section 10.02 and Section 6.06, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 9.10 and 10.01(g).
provided
however
(b) A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, will be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
(c) It will not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section 10.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it will be sufficient if such Act approves the substance thereof.
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article X or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 9.01) will be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but will not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article X, this Indenture will be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture will form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder will be bound thereby.
 
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article X will conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article X may, and will if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
 
(a) The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person, or transfer (by lease, assignment, sale, or otherwise) all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another Person unless:
(i) either (A) the Company shall be the continuing or surviving Person in such a consolidation or merger or (B) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company are transferred (the Company or such other Person being referred to as the "Surviving Person") shall be a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, trust or other legal entity organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, or the District of Columbia, and shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, all of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and the Indenture;
(ii) immediately after the transaction and the incurrence or anticipated incurrence of any Indebtedness to be incurred in connection therewith, no Default will exist; and
(iii) an Officer's Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee to the effect that the conditions set forth in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) have been satisfied and an Opinion of Counsel (from a counsel who shall not be an employee of the Company) has been delivered to the Trustee to the effect that the conditions set forth in the preceding clause (i) have been satisfied.
(b) The Surviving Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a party hereto, and thereafter the predecessor corporation will be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.
 
(a) The Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to each Holder of the Securities and the Trustee the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption, by repurchase, or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities (the "Obligations"). The Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article XII notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
 
(b) The Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. The Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Obligations. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by:
(i) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise;
(ii) any extension or renewal of any thereof;
(iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement;
(iv) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Obligations or any of them;
(v) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; or
(vi) any change in the ownership of the Company.
(c) The Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a Guarantee of payment when due (and not a Guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Obligations.
(d) The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
(e) The Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
 
(f) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against the Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any of the Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption, by repurchase or otherwise, the Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law).
(g) The Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Obligations, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee.
(h) the Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section.
 
(a) The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder will be limited to those set forth in this Article XII and to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor, result in the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law.
(b) The Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Company without limitation. The Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to a Person other than the Company (whether or not an Affiliate of the Guarantor), provided, that upon any such consolidation, merger or sale to which the Guarantor is a party, other than transactions in which the Guarantor is the surviving Person, the Obligations shall be expressly assumed by supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee, by the Person formed by such consolidation, or into which the Guarantor shall have been merged, or which shall have acquired such property and the Guarantor will be deemed released from all its obligations under the Indenture and its Guarantee and such Guarantee will terminate.
(c) Upon Defeasance in accordance with Article V hereof or satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture in accordance with Article XIII hereof, the Guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee and such Guarantee will terminate.
 
Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, the Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Trustee or any Holder against the Company or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the
 
Trustee or any Holder for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall the Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Company in respect of payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Trustee and the Holders by the Company on account of the Obligations are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust for the Trustee and the Holders, segregated from other funds of the Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantor, be turned over to the Trustee in the exact form received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the Trustee, if required), to be applied against the Obligations.
 
This Indenture will upon a Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:
(a) either:
(i) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (A) Securities which have been destroyed, lost, or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.07 and (B) Securities for the payment of which money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 6.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(ii) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (A) have become due and payable, (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company or the Guarantor, in the case of clause (A), (B), or (C) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(b) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
(c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been satisfied.
 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 9.06, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 9.13, and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (ii) of clause (a) of this Section 13.01, the obligations of the Trustee under Sections 6.03(e) and 13.02, will survive.
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(e), all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 13.01 will be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for the payment of which such money has been deposited with the Trustee; and such money shall be segregated from other funds to the extent required by law.
 
All the covenants, stipulations, promises, and agreements in this Indenture contained by or on behalf of the Company will bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, Act of Holders, or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with:
(a) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company will be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made upon, given, furnished, or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Department; or
(b) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder will be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at 7 West Seventh Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 (marked for the attention of both the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel) or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
The Trustee shall have the right, but shall not be required, to rely upon and comply with instructions and directions sent by e-mail, facsimile and other similar unsecured electronic methods by Persons believed by the Trustee to be authorized to give instructions and directions on behalf of the Company. The Trustee shall have no duty or obligation to verify or confirm that the Person who sent such instructions or directions is, in fact, a Person authorized to give instructions or directions on behalf of the Company; and the Trustee shall have no liability for any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or sustained by the Company as a result of such reliance upon or compliance with such instructions or directions. The Company agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties.
 
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver will be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders will be filed with the Trustee, but such filing will not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as may be made with the approval of the Trustee will constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
 
This Indenture and the Securities will be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes will be construed in accordance with the laws of said State.
The Company irrevocably consents and submits, for itself and in respect of any of its assets or property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York or any United States Federal court sitting, in each case, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, United States of America, and any appellate court from any thereof in any suit, action or proceeding that may be brought in connection with this Indenture or the Securities, and waives any immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts. The Company irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to any such suit, action or proceeding that may be brought in such courts whether on the grounds of venue, residence or domicile or on the ground that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent that it lawfully may do so, that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company, and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to the enforcement by any competent court in the Company's jurisdiction of organization of judgments validly obtained in any such court in New York on the basis of such suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company does not waive, and the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver of, (i) any right to appeal any such judgment, to seek any stay or otherwise to seek reconsideration or review of any such judgment or (ii) any stay of execution or levy pending an appeal from, or a suit, action or proceeding for reconsideration of, any such judgment.
 
EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE GUARANTOR AND THE TRUSTEE, AND EACH HOLDER OF A SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE THEREOF, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE SECURITIES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
 
Upon any application or request by the Company to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Company will furnish to the Trustee such certificates and opinions as may be required under the Trust Indenture Act. Each such certificate or opinion will be given in the form of an Officer's Certificate, if to be given by an officer of the Company, an Opinion of Counsel, if to be given by counsel, or a certificate or opinion of an accountant, if to be given by an accountant or accounting firm, and will comply with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and any other requirements set forth in this Indenture; provided that no such Opinion of Counsel shall be required to be delivered in connection with the issuance of any Securities that are issued on the date hereof or the execution and delivery of any Securities dated as of the date hereof.
 
In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. Where any Person is required to make, give, or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions, or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
 
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision will apply in lieu of this Section 14.08)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, that interest will accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.
provided
 
If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed on any Person by Sections 310 through 317, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act (including provisions automatically deemed included in this Indenture pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act unless this Indenture provides that such provisions are excluded), which are deemed to be a part of and govern this Indenture, whether or not contained herein, then such imposed duties will control.
 
In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Indenture or in the Securities is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such validity, illegality, or enforceability will not affect any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities, but this Indenture and such Securities will be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein.
 
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be an original, but such counterparts will together constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments (including instruments in electronic, digital or other machine-readable form) of substantially similar tenor signed (including signatures in electronic, digital or other machine-readable form) by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing (including writings in electronic, digital or other machine-readable form); and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action will become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of signature of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent will be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 9.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section 14.12.
(b) The fact and date of the signing by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such signing or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the signing thereof. Where such signing is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit will also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the signing of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person signing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
 
(c) The ownership of Securities will be proved by the Security Register.
(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other Act of the Holder of any Security will bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange thereof or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted, or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(e) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, set any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series. With regard to any record date set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, will be entitled to give or take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. With regard to any action that may be given or taken hereunder only by Holders of a requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series (or their duly appointed agents) and for which a record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, at its option, set an expiration date after which no such action purported to be given or taken by any Holder will be effective hereunder unless given or taken on or prior to such expiration date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents). On or prior to any expiration date set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, on one or more occasions at its option, extend such date to any later date. Nothing in this paragraph will prevent any Holder (or any duly appointed agent thereof) from giving or taking, after any such expiration date, any action identical to, or, at any time, contrary to or different from, the action or purported action to which such expiration date relates, in which event the Company may set a record date in respect thereof pursuant to this paragraph. Nothing in this Section 14.12(e) will be construed to render ineffective any action taken at any time by the Holders (or their duly appointed agents) of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is so taken. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the Trust Indenture Act, the Company will not set a record date for, and the provisions of this Section 14.12(e) will not apply with respect to, any notice, declaration, or direction referred to in the next paragraph.
(f) Upon receipt by the Trustee from any Holder of Securities of a particular series of (a) any notice of default or breach referred to in Section 8.01(a)(iv) or 8.01(a)(v) with respect to Securities of such series, if such default or breach has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee shall not have given such notice to the Company, (b) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 8.01(b), if an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee shall not have given such a declaration to the Company, or (c) any direction referred to in Section 8.06 with respect to Securities of such
 
series, if the Trustee shall not have taken the action specified in such direction, then a record date will automatically and without any action by the Company or the Trustee be set for determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such notice, declaration, or direction, which record date will be the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the day on which the Trustee receives such notice, declaration, or direction. Promptly after such receipt by the Trustee, and in any case not later than the fifth calendar day thereafter, the Trustee will notify the Company and the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series of any such record date so fixed. The Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, will be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such notice, declaration, or direction shall have become effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents) having joined therein on or prior to the 90th calendar day after such record date, such notice, declaration, or direction will automatically and without any action by any Person be cancelled and of no further effect. Nothing in this Section 14.12(f) will be construed to prevent a Holder (or a duly appointed agent thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a notice, declaration, or direction contrary to or different from, or, after the expiration of such period, identical to, the notice, declaration, or direction to which such record date relates, in which event a new record date in respect thereof will be set pursuant to this Section 14.12(f). Nothing in this Section 14.12(f) will be construed to render ineffective any notice, declaration, or direction of the type referred to in this Section 14.12(f) given at any time to the Trustee and the Company by Holders (or their duly appointed agents) of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such notice, declaration, or direction is so given.
provided
(g) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give or take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any different part of such principal amount.
 
The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and will not affect the construction hereof.
