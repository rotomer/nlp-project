FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S, INC. FIRST QUARTER SAME-STORE SALES UP 4.4%
Combined March-April same-store sales grow 4.4%, consistent with increased guidance; April same-store sales rise 1.2%
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 3, 2012  Macy's, Inc. today reported total sales of $1.928 billion for the four weeks ended April 28, 2012, an increase of 0.4 percent compared with total sales of $1.920 billion in the four weeks ended April 30, 2011. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc. sales were up 1.2 percent in April 2012 as compared to April 2011.
 
For March-April combined, same-store sales were up 4.4 percent in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. This was within the company's March-April same-store sales guidance, which initially was for an increase of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, then raised on April 5 to a range of 4.3 to 4.5 percent.  As previously reported, April sales were planned to be weaker than in March, given the calendar shift in which the pre-Easter period fell into March this year versus April last year, and a significant cosmetics event shift from April last year to March this year. Moreover, April 2012 sales were disadvantaged by a Mother's Day that is later in May this year.
 
"Our business at Macy's and Bloomingdale's continues to perform very well and sales in April met our expectations," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "Our customers continue to respond to fresh fashion merchandise. Our assortment is trend-right and distinctive, which is a testament to the skill and experience of our central merchants, as well as the continued success of our My Macy's field organization in tailoring merchandise by store. We continue to see the power of our omnichannel strategy in driving sales online and in the stores."
 
For the first quarter, Macy's, Inc.'s sales totaled $6.147 billion, up 4.4 percent from total sales of $5.889 billion in the first 13 weeks of 2011. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s first quarter sales were up 4.4 percent in 2012 over 2011.
 
Online sales in 2012 (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 29.9 percent in April and 33.7 percent in the first quarter compared to 2011. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
