FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MACY'S, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF 43 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, A 43% INCREASE
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 9, 2012  Macy's, Inc. today reported significantly increased sales and earnings for the first quarter of 2012, the 13-week period ended April 28, 2012. Earnings for the quarter were 43 cents per diluted share, an increase of 43 percent compared with 30 cents per diluted share in the same period last year.
"The momentum in our business at Macy's and Bloomingdale's continued to build in the first quarter, with sales and earnings that exceeded our expectations going into the year. The quarterly data clearly demonstrates the strength of our results as we continue to implement our key strategies - My Macy's merchandise localization; omnichannel integration of stores, online and mobile; and MAGIC Selling for enhanced customer engagement," said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"We are as excited about the future as we have been about the significant progress we have made over the past several years to build a culture of growth at Macy's, Inc.," Lundgren said. "In particular, we feel very good about the business opportunities in front of us for the remainder of fiscal 2012. This spring, Macy's significant national promotion featuring the fashions, colors and rhythms of Brazil is an example of a new dimension in merchandising and marketing innovation to capture the imaginations of our diverse customers.  We have numerous initiatives in place to generate continuous improvement at Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the coming quarters and years, including new thinking we recently announced for attracting customers in the Millennial generation."

Notes:
 
(1) Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year.
 
(2)  Merchandise inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method.  Application of this method did not impact cost of sales for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012 or April 30, 2011.
 
(3) Federal, state and local income taxes differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, principally because of the effect of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations.
