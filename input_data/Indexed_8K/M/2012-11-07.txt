FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
OF 36 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE
Company increases full-year earnings guidance
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 7, 2012  Macy's, Inc. today reported strong third quarter earnings that underscore the company's continued progress in implementing key business strategies to drive growth. Earnings were 36 cents per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012, ended Oct. 27, 2012. This compares with earnings of 32 cents per diluted share in last year's third quarter.
 
"We were pleased to deliver sales and earnings growth for the 11 consecutive quarter," said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. "Our success in the third quarter reflected a combination of factors, as has been the case over the past several years. We continue to implement our My Macy's localization, omnichannel integration and enhanced customer engagement strategies with increasing precision, passion and success. This has helped us to deepen our relationship with customers and capture market share.

"We have confidence in our ability to continue to grow sales and earnings in the fourth quarter, even taking into account a recovery from Hurricane Sandy that will cause stress to consumers and our employees in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Throughout the holiday season, we will be offering our customers new and fresh merchandise assortments, great value and an engaging shopping environment at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's - in store, online and via mobile devices. We are providing more reasons than ever for customers to shop us first and buy from Macy's and Bloomingdale's, especially for memorable gifts for family and friends," Lundgren said.
 
For the first three quarters of 2012, Macy's, Inc.'s diluted earnings per share were $1.45, compared with earnings of $1.18 per diluted share in the first three quarters of 2011. 
 
Sales
 
Sales in the third quarter totaled $6.075 billion, up 3.8 percent from total sales of $5.853 billion in the third quarter of 2011. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s third quarter sales were up 3.7 percent.
 
For the year to date, Macy's, Inc. sales totaled $18.336 billion, up 3.7 percent from total sales of $17.681 billion in the first 39 weeks of 2011. On a same-store basis, Macy's, Inc.'s year-to-date sales were up 3.7 percent.
Online sales (macys.com and bloomingdales.com combined) were up 40.4 percent in the third quarter and 36.8 percent year to date, compared with the same periods in 2011. Online sales positively affected the company's same-store sales by 2.2 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.8 percentage points in the year to date. Online sales are included in the same-store sales calculation for Macy's, Inc.
 
In the third quarter, the company opened new Bloomingdale's Outlet stores, as previously announced, in Westbury, NY, and Grand Prairie, TX. A third new Bloomingdale's Outlet store in Livermore, CA, is opening in the second week of the fourth quarter. A Macy's men's and furniture store in Santa Ana, CA, was closed in the third quarter, with its business consolidated into a full-line Macy's store in the same shopping center.
 
Macy's, Inc. announced today that it will discontinue reporting monthly sales, beginning in fiscal 2013, consistent with the practice of most other retailers. Sales will continue to be reported quarterly, along with earnings and cash flow.
 
Operating Income
 
Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $325 million or 5.4 percent of sales for the quarter ended Oct. 27, 2012, compared with operating income of $291 million or 5.0 percent of sales for the same period last year. For the first three quarters of 2012, Macy's, Inc.'s operating income totaled $1.270 billion or 6.9 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $1.127 billion or 6.4  percent of sales for the same period last year.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $889 million in the first three quarters of 2012, compared with $627 million in the first three quarters of 2011. Net cash used by investing activities in the first three quarters of 2012 was $615 million, compared with $472 million a year ago. Net cash used by financing activities in the first three quarters of 2012 was $1.837 billion, compared with net cash used by financing activities in the first three quarters of 2011 of $522 million.
 
The company repurchased approximately 10.3 million shares of its common stock for a total of approximately $403 million in the third quarter of 2012. In the fiscal year to date, the company repurchased approximately 26.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $991 million. At Oct. 27, 2012, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $361 million of its common stock. The company previously stated that it plans to repurchase at least $1 billion in shares in fiscal 2012 under its repurchase program.
 
Looking Ahead
 
Macy's, Inc. is increasing its full-year 2012 earnings guidance to $3.35 to $3.40 per diluted share, including fourth quarter earnings guidance of $1.94 to $1.99 per diluted share. Previous 2012 full-year guidance (provided on Aug. 8) was for earnings of $3.30 to $3.35 per share, and compares to initial guidance of $3.25 to $3.30 per diluted share provided at the beginning of the year.  The guidance does not give effect to expenses associated with the debt tender offer announced on Oct. 29, the amount of which will depend upon the amount and series of notes purchased and presently cannot be determined.
As reported in the October sales news release issued on Nov. 1, the company has raised its guidance for same-store sales growth in the second half of 2012 to approximately 4 percent (from previous guidance of up approximately 3.7 percent). This calculates to guidance for same-store sales in the fourth quarter to grow by approximately 4.2 percent, and for full-year 2012 sales to grow by 3.9 percent. This compares with guidance provided at the beginning of the year for 2012 same-store sales to be up by approximately 3.5 percent.
 
Macy's, Inc., with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York, is one of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2011 sales of $26.4 billion. The company operates about 840 department stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico under the names of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as well as the macys.com and bloomingdales.com websites. The company also operates 12 Bloomingdale's Outlet stores.
