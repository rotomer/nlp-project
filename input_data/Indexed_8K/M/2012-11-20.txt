On November 20, 2012, Macy's, Inc. ("Macy's") and its wholly owned subsidiary, Macy's Retail Holdings, Inc. ("Macy's Holdings"), entered into the Third Supplemental Trust Indenture (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") and the Fourth Supplemental Trust Indenture (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of January 13, 2012, among Macy's Holdings, as issuer, Macy's, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Base Indenture" and, together with the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), in connection with the offer and sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of Macy's Holdings' 2.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes) and $250 million aggregate principal amount of Macy's Holdings' 4.30% Senior Notes due 2043 (the "2043 Notes" and, together with the 2023 Notes, the "senior notes"), each of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Macy's. This sale of the senior notes satisfies the financing condition of the previously announced tender offer by Macy's Holdings for a portion of its outstanding debt securities pursuant to an offer to purchase dated October 29, 2012, as amended.
Macy's Holdings will pay interest on the senior notes on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on February 15, 2013. The 2023 Notes will mature on February 15, 2023 and the 2043 Notes will mature on February 15, 2043. Before November 15, 2022, Macy's Holdings may, at any time, redeem the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series, plus a "make whole" premium described in the Indenture. On or after November 15, 2022, Macy's Holdings may redeem the 2023 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Before August 15, 2042, Macy's Holdings may, at any time, redeem the 2043 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series, plus a "make whole" premium described in the Indenture. On or after August 15, 2042, Macy's Holdings may redeem the 2043 Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Upon the occurrence of both (i) a change of control of Macy's and (ii) within a specified period in relation to the change of control, a downgrade of the senior notes by at least two of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and being rated below an investment grade rating by at least two of such rating agencies, Macy's Holdings will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
The senior notes are subject to the covenants in the Indenture, which include limitations on liens, limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on sales of assets, and limitations on merger and consolidation.
The Indenture contains customary events of default, including: (a) failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any senior note when due; (b) failure to pay any interest on any senior note for 30 days after the interest becomes due; (c) failure to redeem or repurchase any senior note when required to do so; (d) Macy's Holdings' failure to perform, or its breach of, any other covenant in the Indenture for 60 days after written notice thereof; (e) nonpayment at maturity or other default (beyond any applicable grace period) under any agreement or instrument relating to any other indebtedness of Macy's Holdings or any of its restricted subsidiaries, the unpaid principal amount of which is not less than $100 million, which default results in the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness; (f) the entry of any final judgment or order against Macy's Holdings, Macy's or any of their restricted subsidiaries, which judgment or order creates a liability of $100 million or more in excess of insured amounts and which has not been stayed, vacated, discharged, or otherwise satisfied for a period of 60 days; (g) Macy's guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect; and (h) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving Macy's Holdings, Macy's or any significant subsidiary (or group of subsidiaries that would constitute a significant subsidiary) of Macy's or Macy's Holdings.
If an event of default resulting from specified events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, the Indenture provides that the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the senior notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the senior notes. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture provides that either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding senior notes of a series may declare the principal amount of all the senior notes of that series to be due and payable immediately.
 
The foregoing disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Base Indenture, Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, which are included as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2 and Exhibit 4.3 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the offering of the senior notes, Macy's is filing certain other exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Underwriter Indemnified Party
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the
 
Company or the Guarantor (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase any of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the Underwriters or another party or other parties to purchase such Notes on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Underwriters to purchase such Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes or the Company notifies the Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, as the case may be, the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Statutory Prospectus, any prospectus wrapper and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus which in the opinion of the Underwriters may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Notes.
Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes as set forth in Schedule A hereto, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of such Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of such Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of such Notes of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes as set forth in Schedule A hereto, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company and the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
