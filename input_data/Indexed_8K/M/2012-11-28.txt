FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MACY'S ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF DEBT TENDER OFFER
 
CINCINNATI, Ohio, November 28, 2012  Macy's, Inc. today announced the closing of the cash tender offerby its wholly owned subsidiary, Macy's Retail Holdings, Inc., to purchase up to $700 million  in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debt securities listed on the table below (the "Notes").
 
"Through this transaction and our recent debt issuance, we have successfully improved our debt maturity profile and decreased our ongoing interest expense," said Karen M. Hoguet, Macy's, Inc. chief financial officer.
 
Macy's, Inc. expects to record additional interest expense relating to the tender offer of approximately $133 million ($83 million after income taxes) prior to February 2, 2013. By completing the tender offer and related financing, Macy's interest expense is anticipated to be reduced on a full year basis by $30 million.
 
An aggregate principal amount of $1,178,097,000 of Notes was validly tendered in the tender offer and not validly withdrawn.  The table below identifies the principal amount of each series of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and the principal amount that Macy's Retail Holdings has accepted for purchase:
 
                       
(1)
The 5.90% Senior Notes due 2016 were subject to a maximum principal amount limitation of $400 million in the tender offer.
(2)
The final proration factors have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point for presentation purposes.
 
The amount of each series of Notes purchased was determined under the terms and conditions of the tender offer as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated October 29, 2012, as modified by Macy's press release, dated November 13, 2012. Because the maximum aggregate principal amount of $700 million for the tender offer was exceeded, and the maximum aggregate principal amount of $400 million for the 5.90% Senior Notes due 2016 was also exceeded, Macy's Retail Holdings did not accept all of the Notes tendered for purchase.
 
The consideration for the Notes accepted for purchase, as calculated by the Dealer Managers and announced on November 13, 2012, plus accrued and unpaid interest, will be paid today, November 28, 2012.  Notes that have been tendered but not accepted will be promptly returned to the tendering parties.
 
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC served as the Coordinating Dealer Manager and BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as the other Dealer Managers for the tender offer. Global Bondholder Services Corporation is the Information Agent and the Depositary. Persons with questions regarding the tender offer should contact Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC at (toll-free) (800) 820-1653, BofA Merrill Lynch at (toll-free) (888) 292-0070 and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (toll-free) (866) 834-4666.
