ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits. Exhibit 99.1 Press Release of MasterCard International Incorporated, dated August 2, 2004. ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004. The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and cards on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded and MasterCard Electronic(TM)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth
in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. Period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume for worldwide off-line debit and credit programs have been impacted by portfolio changes that resulted in the reclassification of certain volumes previously reported as off-line debit program volumes into credit program volumes. Accordingly, the rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume for worldwide off-line debit and credit programs may be adjusted in the future. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Certain information in the preceding tables has been the subject of prior public release by MasterCard. The information in the preceding tables for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 has been restated to conform to the presentation of information in the tables for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and to reflect revisions to certain historical statistical information provided by MasterCard's members subsequent to the previous release of this information by MasterCard. Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated August 2, 2004, which further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004.

Total purchases on MasterCard credit and offline debit cards rose 11.7% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2003, and the number of MasterCard cards issued around the world rose to 638.3 million. "The first half of this year has been successful for both MasterCard and our customers," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard President and CEO. "Many of the issues that limited economic growth last year are behind us, and we've seen stronger purchase activity across our global network as more confident consumers increased spending. Also this quarter, our Asia/Pacific region reported growth in gross dollar volume (GDV) up for the first time in 18 months reflecting renewed consumer confidence in the region." Performance highlights for the second quarter and first half of 2004 include: - Cardholders across the globe used MasterCard-branded cards for almost 4.1 billion transactions, generating GDV of $349.0 billion in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 9.2% over the same period in 2003. In the first six months of 2004, transactions reached 7.8 billion, generating GDV of $680.8 billion, an 8.8% gain over the same period in 2003. GDV includes both purchase and cash volume; - MasterCard's almost 25,000 customer financial institutions around the world had issued more than 638.3 million MasterCard-branded cards, a 6.4% increase over the same six-month period in 2003; - The value of purchases on MasterCard-branded cards, a significant measure of success, continued to show double-digit growth worldwide. Globally, purchase volume rose 11.7% to $257.1 billion for the second quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.

MasterCard International-Page 3 MasterCard International Reports Continued Growth For Second Quarter, First Six Months of 2004 August 2, 2004 SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES ACHIEVED MasterCard also achieved a wide range of significant business milestones in the first half of 2004: - MasterCard announced an initiative to attack "phishing" before it happens. MasterCard will work with NameProtect, a leading digital fraud detection company, to identify sites established to steal personal information. These sites are often used to launch phishing attacks via email that can ultimately result in identity theft. In addition, MasterCard and NameProtect will identify sites that broker illegally-obtained payment card numbers. NameProtect's technology will identify online scams in real-time, globally, by searching domain names, web pages, chat rooms, and more. MasterCard will send out rapid alerts to members when their accounts are identified as being at risk, and notify authorities of potential compromises. - MasterCard signature debit cards were again accepted at all Wal-Mart store locations in the U.S., underscoring a significant win for MasterCard cardholders in giving them as much choice in payments as possible. In addition to MasterCard signature debit cards, Wal-Mart will continue to accept all other MasterCard payment products, including credit, PIN debit, and corporate cards. - McDonald's(R) joined with MasterCard to provide MasterCard cardholders with cashless payment options at more than 3,000 McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. Cashless payments include credit cards and PIN and signature-debit card payments. McDonald's expects the number of participating restaurants to more than double by year-end. - MasterCard Advisors(TM), the professional services arm of MasterCard International, announced the acquisition of consulting firm Watch Hill Partners, which specializes in optimization of customer relationships through multiple channels and technologies. MasterCard Advisors also announced the launch of a new Web-based financial tool, PurchaseLogic, which gives corporations a transparent view of their entire procure-to-pay process. - MasterCard announced that a number of the world's leading smart card vendors signed its M/Chip(TM) 4 Development Agreement and are actively developing products in support of M/Chip 4 for 2004 availability. M/Chip 4 is at the core of MasterCard's smart card strategy and represents the latest generation of EMV payment applications. NOTE TO EDITORS Online debit activity, which includes MasterCard's online debit program, Maestro, and MasterCard's ATM-only brand, Cirrus, will be available at a later date. - more -
