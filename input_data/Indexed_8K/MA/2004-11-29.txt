ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On November 23, 2004, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated, the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, and UMB Bank & Trust, N.A., as indenture trustee for the 7.36% Series A Senior Secured Notes (the "notes"), amended the terms of MasterCard International's guarantee in connection with the notes by transferring certain obligations from MasterCard International to MasterCard Incorporated. The notes were issued in August 1999 by MasterCard International O'Fallon 1999 Trust, a consolidated variable interest entity, to finance MasterCard's global technology and operations facility in O'Fallon Missouri. As a result of the amendment to the guarantee, MasterCard Incorporated has become a party to the guarantee and has assumed certain covenant compliance obligations, including financial reporting and maintenance of consolidated net worth. The amendment to the guarantee aligns MasterCard's financial reporting and net worth covenant obligations under the guarantee with similar obligations under its other debt instruments. MasterCard entered into the amendment to the guarantee to better reflect MasterCard's corporate structure and to reduce the costs and administrative burden of complying with different debt covenants.
