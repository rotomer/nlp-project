ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three months ended March 31, 2005 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three months ended March 31, 2005. The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard(R)-branded and MasterCard Electronic(TM)-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Maestro(R) and Cirrus(R) on-line debit transactions, Mondex(R) transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained. The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial
cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited logical and statistical verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn revenues. Cash volume growth for offline debit programs in the U.S. region has increased significantly as a result of stricter enforcement of reporting requirements for such data. Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated May 3, 2005, which further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three months ended March 31, 2005.

Focus in 2005 In 2005, MasterCard will continue its focus on broadening customized services to financial institution customers, enhancing relationships with merchants that accept MasterCard cards, and developing innovative payment solutions and services. In the first quarter of 2005 the company has already seen significant business milestones that have helped drive MasterCard's success in these areas: Broadening Customized Services for Financial Institution Customers o The company unveiled its enhanced World MasterCard(R) card program to further establish its leading profile among affluent consumers in the United States. The program offers issuers flexibility and customization options, while providing high-income consumers with unsurpassed global acceptance and an ability to redeem rewards in categories of their choosing. o MasterCard announced the expansion of the MasterCard Global Premium Collection with the addition of more than 50 new high-value offers from the worlds' leading providers of travel and lifestyle services and merchandise.

Master Card International - Page 3 Master Card International Reports Double-Digit GDV Growth in First Quarter of 2005 May 3, 2005 Enhancing Relationships with Merchants that Accept MasterCard Cards o MasterCard launched a new initiative to help merchants and their business partners safeguard card transaction data and prevent fraud. The first-of-its-kind program will focus on helping merchants understand how to implement the requirements necessary for storing, securing and sharing transaction data. o Marriott International, Inc. announced its participation in the MasterCard enhanced hotel folio data program. Now corporations whose business travelers pay with eligible MasterCard(R) Corporate Cards will receive line item expense data for stays at approximately 1,500 Marriott-branded hotels in the United States and Canada. Marriott's participation extends MasterCard e-Folio's reach to more than 7,000 hotel properties in North America, far more than any other corporate payments solution provider. Carlson, Choice, and Hilton joined in 2003. With Marriott signed-on, approximately 40 percent of MasterCard corporate card transactions in North America will take place at enrolled hotel properties. Developing Innovative Payment Solutions and Services o MasterCard International announced it is working with MBNA, the Seattle Seahawks and the Baltimore Ravens Football Clubs to incorporate MasterCard(R) PayPass(TM) contactless payment technology into the MBNA Seahawks and MBNA Ravens Extra Points credit card programs. Both Qwest Field in Seattle and M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore will accept MasterCard PayPass cards at the point-of-sale, beginning with the 2005 football season. o Sheetz, Inc. announced that it expects to be the first retailer in the nation to accept MasterCard PayPass(TM) across its entire chain. The innovative radio frequency-based payment option solution represents one of the most significant payment advancements in the retail industry. o MasterCard Advisors(TM), the professional services arm of MasterCard International, continued to build momentum in the first quarter for its innovative offering SpendingPulse(TM), which provides insight into U.S. economic retail sales performance across a number of dimensions, including industry sector and geography. With its unique access to payment activity information, and the ability to extract MasterCard-specific variables, SpendingPulse provides a reliable measure of national retail sales days or weeks ahead of alternative data sources like the U.S. Department of Commerce. o MasterCard International unveiled a new program that makes it easier for taxpayers to settle their U.S. federal tax obligations. Thanks to a relationship with H&R Block(R), the world's largest tax services company, and Link2Gov, a provider of online payment processing for government agencies, Debit MasterCard(R) cardholders can now pay their Federal Tax Year 2004 Form 1040 balance due payment online without incurring a convenience fee.
