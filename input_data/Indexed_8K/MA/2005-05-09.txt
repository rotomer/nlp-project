Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On May 9, 2005, the stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved the MasterCard International Incorporated Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Annual Plan") and the MasterCard International Incorporated Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Plan") at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders. The Annual Plan and the Long-Term Plan, each of which is effective as of January 1, 2005, provides for the payment of cash bonus awards to senior executives who are members of the Company's Policy Committee provided that certain performance targets are achieved. The performance periods are generally one calendar year under the Annual Plan and three calendar years under the Long-Term Plan, although performance periods under either plan can be as short as 90 days. Awards under the Annual Plan are made on an annual basis and cannot exceed $6,000,000 for any participant. Individual awards made under the Long-Term Plan are capped at $8,000,000 and $16,000,000, for target and superior performance respectively, and generally vest over five years with 26 2/3 percent vesting at the end of each of the first, second, and third years, and 20 percent vesting at the end of the fifth year. Both plans are administered by the Company's Compensation Committee which establishes performance targets and determines awards made under the plans. The plans were adopted by the Compensation Committee on March 16, 2005, subject to stockholder approval.
