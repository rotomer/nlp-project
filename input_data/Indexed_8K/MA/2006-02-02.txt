Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding the performance results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005 for the payment programs of MasterCard International Incorporated and MasterCard Europe sprl (collectively, "MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, set forth below are tables that provide information regarding MasterCard's payment programs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, in each case restated to present the information on the same basis as the information in the tables for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005.
 
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
 
 
 
Maestro and Cirrus on-line debit transactions, Mondex transactions and other branded transactions are not included in the preceding tables.
 
For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
 
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit programs and debit programs, and certain data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.
 
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to U.S. dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the current and historical periods.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts, cards and acceptance locations columns is derived from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's members subsequent to the date of its release which revisions and amendments may be material.
 
A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances.
 
The tables include information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues. Accordingly, the data in the tables cannot be taken as a direct indication of the financial performance of MasterCard. Cash volumes for the periods indicated in the tables above for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region are higher due to expanded data collection and stricter enforcement of reporting requirements during these periods. Some of the data in the Asia/Pacific region for the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2004 have been estimated in order to conform to current presentation standards and ensure comparable statistics. In addition, a change in methodology for characterizing volumes for certain transactions in China and the United Kingdom have lowered purchase volume and increased cash volume in the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions.
 
Attached also as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by MasterCard International Incorporated, dated February 2, 2006 that further discusses the results of MasterCard's payment programs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2005 which exhibit is furnished and not filed herewith.

This press release contains forward-looking information. Although MasterCard believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its objectives will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking information contained in this press release include: global political and economic conditions; MasterCard's ability to achieve its strategic objectives; the performance of MasterCard's member financial institutions and the nature of MasterCard's business relationships with these institutions; substantial and increasingly intense competition in the global payments industry; the success of MasterCard's global advertising, sponsorship, promotion and merchant acceptance initiatives; the functionality and security of MasterCard's transaction processing systems; MasterCard's ability to adapt to industry trends with technological and payment program innovations; the resolution of certain legal proceedings and regulatory actions; changing market dynamics and the other risk factors disclosed in MasterCard Incorporated's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. MasterCard disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking information.

The data in this press release is provided by the member financial institutions of MasterCard International Incorporated and its affiliates ("MasterCard") and is subject to revision and amendment by such members subsequent to the date of its release which revisions and amendments may be material. A portion of the data relating to accounts and cards reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. Information with respect to gross dollar volumes ("GDV") includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.
 
Period-over-period rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume are provided on a local-currency basis in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change in this press release cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to the U.S. dollar volume information presented for the current and historical periods.
 
MasterCard-branded data regarding GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. MasterCard-branded data concerning accounts, cards and acceptance locations is derived from information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. Certain information with respect to acceptance locations is provided by third parties and has not been independently verified by MasterCard.
 
The data in this press release includes information with respect to MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues. Accordingly, the data in this press release cannot be taken as a direct indication of the financial performance of MasterCard International or its parent company, MasterCard Incorporated. Cash volumes for the periods indicated in the tables above for MasterCard-branded debit programs in the U.S. region and credit programs in the Asia/Pacific region are higher due to expanded data collection and stricter enforcement of reporting requirements during these periods. Some of the data in the Asia/Pacific region for the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2004 have been estimated in order to conform to current presentation standards and ensure comparable statistics.
 
In addition, a change in methodology for characterizing volumes for certain transactions in China and the United Kingdom have lowered purchase volume and increased cash volume in the Asia/Pacific and Europe regions.
