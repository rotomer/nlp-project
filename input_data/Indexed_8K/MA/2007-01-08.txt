Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
On December 31, 2006, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company"), in the ordinary course of its business, issued 46 shares of its Class M common stock to new principal members of MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), its principal operating subsidiary, pursuant to the amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Charter"). In the aggregate, these issuances were more than one percent of the Class M shares outstanding. Pursuant to Article IV, Section 4.3(G) of the Charter, the Company issues a share of Class M common stock upon each principal member of MasterCard becoming a member and executing a license agreement with MasterCard.
The shares of Class M common stock were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis that the transaction, the issuance of a share upon the issuance of a license, did not involve any public offering.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
