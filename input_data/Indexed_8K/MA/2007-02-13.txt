Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
In December 2003, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, and eFunds Corporation ("eFunds") entered into a Marketing Sales and Services Alliance Agreement (the "Agreement") whereby the parties agreed to work together to provide debit processing services to financial institutions. After careful analysis of the needs of its customers and its business, on December 13, 2006, MasterCard notified eFunds that, pursuant to one of the provisions in the Agreement, it was terminating the Agreement. On or about January 30, 2007, eFunds filed a verified complaint against MasterCard in Superior Court for the State of Arizona, alleging that MasterCard's termination of the Agreement was improper. The complaint asserts several causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraudulent inducement. eFunds seeks a declaratory judgment that the Agreement remains in full force and effect, or, in the alternative, monetary damages.
MasterCard has not yet been served with a copy of the complaint and therefore its time to respond has not begun to run.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
