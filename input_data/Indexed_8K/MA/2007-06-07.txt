The Board may fix a record date for the purposes of determining those holders of Class M Common Stock of record whose Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), Gross Acquiring Volume (GAV) and Revenues Paid shall be included in determining a Global Proxy Calculation for a particular period, which record date shall not be more than 30 days prior to the end of any such period.

The Corporation, acting through relevant employees selected by the Chief Executive Officer from time to time, shall compute the Global Proxy Calculation for each holder of Class M Common Stock for each applicable 12-month period and the results of such computation will be on file at the Corporation's principal office and will be made available to any stockholder of the Corporation upon request 180 days after the end of the 12-month period to which the computation relates. The Global Proxy Calculation for any 12-month period shall remain in effect for any and all matters until the calculation for a more recent 12-month period is made available by the Corporation. The Board may make such interpretations with respect to the implementation of the Global Proxy Calculation as it may determine to be necessary or desirable in its sole and absolute discretion and shall have the final authority, which may be delegated to the officers of the Corporation, to determine the Global Proxy Calculation for any period in its sole and absolute discretion, and any such determination shall be final and binding for all purposes unless the Board determines that an error was made in the computation, in which case the computation shall be corrected in accordance with the directions of the Board.

provided
however
(3) As long as any shares of Class B Common Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock, that number of shares of Class A Common Stock necessary to effect the conversion of all of the then outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the Board determines that the number of authorized but unissued
 
shares of Class A Common Stock would be insufficient to effect the conversion of all of the then outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, the Board shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Corporation's authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to be increased to such number of shares as shall be sufficient to effect such conversion.
(4) Upon the occurrence of a conversion pursuant to Section 4.3(D)(1)(A) or 4.3(D)(1)(B), the Class B Common Stock so converted shall be retired and may not be reissued.

The Committee shall have authority to grant Performance Units under the Plan at any time or from time to time. A Performance Unit consists of the right to receive Common Shares or cash, as provided in the particular Award Agreement, upon achievement of a performance goal or goals (as the case may be) under Section 15.6. The Committee may condition grant or vesting of Performance Units upon execution of, and/or compliance with, a non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or both. The Committee shall have complete discretion to determine the number of Performance Units granted to each Participant. Each Performance Unit Award shall be evidenced by, and be subject to the terms of, an Agreement. The Performance Unit Award shall be earned in accordance with the Agreement over a Performance Period. Performance Units may be granted alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan.
 
Unless expressly waived in the Award Agreement, vesting of Performance Unit Awards must be contingent on the attainment of one or more performance goals set forth in Section 15.6 and in such case shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.

(1) . In the event of a Termination of Employment during a Performance Period due to Death, Performance Units for the Performance Period shall immediately vest and be paid out at a target level of performance.

Distribution of earned Performance Units may be made at the same time payments are made to Participants who did not incur a Termination of Employment during the applicable Performance Period.
Termination by Disability or Retirement
 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in an Agreement, Performance Units may not be sold, assigned, margined, transferred, encumbered, conveyed, gifted, alienated, hypothecated, pledged, or otherwise disposed of, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
Other Awards of Common Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based upon or settled in, Common Shares, may be granted under the Plan either alone or in addition to other Awards under the Plan. The Committee shall have authority to grant such Other Stock-Based Awards under terms and conditions determined by the Committee.

The Committee, in its discretion, may condition eligibility to be designated a Participant in the Plan and receipt of benefits specified in the Agreement, such as vesting, payment, and exercisability of awards, on the Participant's execution of, compliance with, and/or certification of compliance with a non-competition and/or non-solicitation agreement in a form prescribed by the Company.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary and unless otherwise specifically provided in an Agreement, in the event of a Participant's Termination of Employment by the Company or its Successor without Cause or by the Participant with Good Reason (after having given written notice to the Company of the grounds for Termination of Employment for Good Reason, which grounds specified in the written notice have not been cured by the Company within 90 days of the written notice) within six months preceding or two years following a Change in Control:
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee shall have full discretion, notwithstanding anything herein or in an Agreement to the contrary, with respect to an outstanding Award upon a Change in Control to provide that the securities of another entity be substituted hereunder for the Common Shares and to make equitable adjustment with respect thereto.

14.1 .
No Company Obligation
Except to the extent required by applicable securities laws, none of the Company, an Affiliated Employer or the Committee shall have any duty or obligation to affirmatively disclose material information to a record or beneficial holder of Common Shares or an Award, and such holder shall have no right to be advised of any material information regarding the Company or an Affiliated Employer at any time prior to, upon, or in connection with receipt or the exercise or distribution of an Award. The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the future value of the Common Shares issued or acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
15.1 .
Amendments and Termination
The Committee may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan, or the terms of any Award Agreement under the Plan, at any time, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of a Participant under an Award theretofore granted without the Participant's consent, unless such an amendment is made to comply with applicable law (including Code Section 409A), stock exchange rules, or accounting rules. Repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be permitted. For this purpose, a "repricing" means any of the following (or any action that has the same effect as any of the following): (1) changing the terms of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right to lower its Exercise Price; (2) any other action that is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles; and (3) repurchasing for cash or cancelling an Option or Stock Appreciation Right at a time when its Exercise Price is greater than the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another Award, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with an event set forth in Section 4.6. A cancellation and exchange described in this Section 15.1(3) shall be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any material amendments to the Plan shall require shareholder approval to the extent required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange or market that regulates the securities of the Company.
15.2 .
Form of Awards
All Awards shall be subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations of the Plan. The Committee may subject any Award to such other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations (including without limitation the time and conditions of
 
Table of Contents
 
exercise, vesting or payment of an Award and restrictions on transferability of any Common Shares issued or delivered pursuant to an Award), provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. The Committee may subject an Award to such conditions as it determines are necessary or appropriate to ensure that an Award constitutes "qualified performance based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Awards under a particular Article of the Plan need not be uniform, and Awards under more than one Article of the Plan may be combined in a single Award Agreement. Any combination of Awards may be granted at one time and on more than one occasion to the same Participant. An Award Agreement for Restricted Stock Units or Performance Units may provide that a Participant may elect to defer receipt of income attributable to the Award. In the event no such election is provided or made, and the Award Agreement does not otherwise provide, the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units shall be payable to the Participant within 2

months of the end of the Company's or the Participant's year of vesting in the Award.
15.3 .
No Reload Rights
Options shall not contain any provisions entitling the Participant to an automatic grant of additional Options in connection with any exercise of the original Option.
15.4 .
Loans
The Committee may approve the extension of a loan by the Company to a Participant who is an Employee for the sole purpose of assisting the participant in paying the exercise price of an Option exercised by means of a cashless exercise program established by the Company, provided, however, that no loan shall be permitted if the extension of such loan would violate any provision of applicable law. Any loan will be made upon such terms and conditions that the Committee shall determine.
15.5 .
Unfunded Status of Plan
It is intended that the Plan be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Shares or make payments; provided, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.
15.6 .
Provisions Relating to Code Section 162(m)
Where expressly provided in writing by the Committee, Awards granted to persons who are (or may become) Covered Employees within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, shall constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" satisfying the relevant requirements of Code Section 162(m). Accordingly, in the case of such Awards, the Plan shall be administered and the provisions of the Plan shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m). If any provision of the Plan or any Agreement relating to such an Award does not comply or is inconsistent with
 
Table of Contents
 
the requirements of Code Section 162(m), such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. In addition, the following provisions shall apply to the Plan or an Award to the extent necessary to obtain a tax deduction for the Company or an Affiliate:

15.8 .
Withholding
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for income tax purposes with respect to any Award, the Participant shall pay to the Company (or other entity identified by the Committee), or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or other entity identified by the Committee regarding the payment of, any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind (including any employment taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to such income. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and its Affiliated Employers shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant. Subject to approval by the Committee, a Participant may elect to have such tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by (i) the delivery of cash or a certified check, (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from Common Shares to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate value that would satisfy the required statutory minimum (but no more than such required minimum) with respect to the Company's withholding obligation, (iii) authorizing the Company to effect a net issuance of Common Shares to satisfy the required statutory minimum withholding (but no more than the minimum), (iv) transferring to the Company Common Shares owned by the Participant with an aggregate value that would satisfy the required statutory minimum (but no more than such required minimum) with respect to the Company's withholding obligation, or (v) in the case of Options, by means of delivery of cash by a broker-dealer as a "cashless exercise."
15.9 .
Controlling Law
The Plan and all Awards made and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York (other than its law respecting choice of law).
15.10 .
Offset
Any amounts owed to the Company or an Affiliated Employer by the Participant of whatever nature may be offset by the Company from the value of any Award to be transferred to the Participant, and no Common Shares, cash or other thing of value under this Plan or an Agreement shall be transferred unless and until all disputes between the Company and the Participant have been fully and finally resolved and the Participant has waived all claims to such against the Company or an Affiliate.
15.11 .
Nontransferability; Beneficiaries
No Award or Common Shares subject to an Award shall be assignable or transferable other than (i) by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a beneficiary designation, (ii) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, or (iii) as expressly permitted by the Committee, pursuant to a transfer to the Participant's family member. Awards shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant, by the Participant's legal representatives in the event of the Participant's
 
Table of Contents
 
incapacity, or by a permitted transferee of the Award. Each Participant may designate a Beneficiary to exercise any Option or Stock Appreciation Right or receive any Award held by the Participant at the time of the Participant's death or to be assigned any other Award outstanding at the time of the Participant's death. No Award or Common Shares subject to an Award shall be subject to the debts of a Participant or Beneficiary or subject to attachment or execution or process in any court action or proceeding unless otherwise provided in this Plan. If a deceased Participant has named no Beneficiary, any Award held by the Participant at the time of death shall be transferred as provided in his or her will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
The Plan shall not constitute a contract of employment, and adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliated Employer to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.
 
Awards may be granted under the Plan from time to time in substitution for awards held by employees, directors or service providers of other corporations who are about to become officers or employees of the Company or an Affiliated Employer as the result of a merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company or an Affiliated Employer, or the acquisition by the Company or an Affiliated Employer of the assets of the employing corporation, or the acquisition by the Company or Affiliated Employer of the shares of the employing corporation, as the result of which it becomes an Affiliated Employer under the Plan. The terms and conditions of the Awards so granted may vary from the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan at the time of such grant as the majority of the members of the Committee may deem appropriate to conform, in whole or in part, to the provisions of the awards in substitution for which they are granted. Any substitutions or exchanges shall be accomplished in a manner that complies with the limitations on exchanges of such Awards imposed under Section 409A of the Code.
 
To the extent the Company uses certificates to represent Common Shares, certificates to be delivered to Participants under this Plan shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have mailed such certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the Participant, at the Participant's last known address on file with the Company. Any reference in this Section or elsewhere in the Plan or an Agreement to actual stock certificates and/or the delivery of actual stock certificates shall be deemed satisfied by the electronic record-keeping and electronic delivery of Common Shares or other mechanism then utilized by the Company and its agents for reflecting ownership of such shares.

To the maximum extent permitted under the Company's Articles of Incorporation and by-laws, each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan or any Award Agreement, and (b) from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's prior written approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Articles of Incorporation or by-laws, by contract, as a matter of law or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
 
No person connected with the Plan in any capacity makes any representation, commitment or guarantee that any tax treatment, including without limitation federal, state and local income, estate, and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to any Awards or payments thereunder made to or for the benefit of a Participant under the Plan or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant on account of participation in the Plan.
 
The Committee may grant Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals, who are located outside the United States or who are not compensated from a payroll managed in the United States, or who are otherwise subject to (or could cause the Company to be subject to) legal or regulatory provisions of countries or jurisdictions outside the United States, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan, and in furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may make such modifications, amendments, procedures, or subplans as may be necessary or advisable to comply with such legal or regulatory provisions.
 
(1) It is the intention of the Company that no Award shall be "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically determines otherwise as provided below, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted accordingly.
 
Table of Contents
 
(2) The terms and conditions governing any Awards that the Committee determines will be subject to Section 409A of the Code, including any rules for elective or mandatory deferral of the delivery of cash or Common Shares pursuant thereto and any rules regarding treatment of such Awards in the event of a Change in Control, shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, and shall comply in all respects with Section 409A of the Code.
(3) Following a Change in Control, no action shall be taken under the Plan that will cause any Award that the Committee has previously determined is subject to Section 409A of the Code to fail to comply in any respect with Section 409A of the Code without the written consent of the Participant.
15.19
No Fractional Shares.
No fractional shares shall be issued or delivered under the Plan or any Award granted hereunder, provided that the Committee in its sole discretion may round fractional shares down to the nearest whole share or settle fractional shares in cash.
15.20
Severability.
If any provision of this Plan shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not effect any other provision hereby, and this Plan shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.
15.21
Successors and Assigns.
This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each successor and assign of the Company. All obligations imposed upon a Participant, and all rights granted to the Company hereunder, shall be binding upon the Participant's heirs, legal representatives and successors.

Entire Agreement.
This Plan and the Agreement constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, provided that in the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and the Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Plan shall control.
