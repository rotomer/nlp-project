Item 8.01. Other Events.
As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on July 2, 2009, MasterCard International Incorporated (the "Company"), the principal operating subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Registrant"), entered into an agreement (the "Prepayment Agreement") on July 1, 2009 to modify its payment obligations under a settlement agreement, dated as of June 4, 2003, with plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit challenging certain aspects of the payment card industry under U.S. federal antitrust law. On August 26, 2009, the court in the class action lawsuit entered a final order approving the Prepayment Agreement. On September 25, 2009, the period to appeal the court order ended, and no appeals were filed with respect to the Prepayment Agreement. As a result, the Prepayment Agreement became final pursuant to its terms on September 25, 2009, and, consistent with previous disclosure and pursuant to the terms of the Prepayment Agreement, the Company made a prepayment of its remaining $400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of $335 million on September 30, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
