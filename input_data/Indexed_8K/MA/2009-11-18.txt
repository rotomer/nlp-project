MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") announced today that Stephanie Voquer, Chief Human Resources Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan to sell a limited amount of the Company's shares for personal financial management purposes, designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's insider trading policies regarding stock transactions (the "10b5-1 Plan").
The 10b5-1 Plan allows for the sale of a maximum of approximately 3,657 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), associated with restricted stock unit awards. The 10b5-1 Plan provides for sales of specified share amounts at specified market prices, subject to specified limitations. Sales pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plan are expected to begin as early as January 11, 2010 and will end no later than April 30, 2010. The 10b5-1 Plan may terminate sooner in accordance with its terms.
Ms. Voquer will continue to be subject to the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines until reaching the age of 62, whereby she is encouraged to hold at least four times her base salary in stock. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, shares of Class A common stock held directly or indirectly by Ms. Voquer are included; however, restricted stock units, performance stock units and unexercised stock options held are excluded.
Transactions made under the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake to report on specific Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans of Company officers, nor to report modifications or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
