On February 1, 2010, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") approved performance targets for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2010 that will be used to determine the amounts of cash bonus awards that may be paid to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and other named executive officers disclosed in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (on April 23, 2009) under its Senior Executive Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("SEAICP"). The cash bonus awards for 2010 under the SEAICP are based upon the Company's achievement of predetermined net income and operating margin improvement targets. Actual bonus award amounts will be based upon a weighting of two-thirds for actual performance achieved against the net income target and one-third for actual performance achieved against the operating margin improvement target. The Compensation Committee may reduce award amounts at its discretion. The Compensation Committee set the 2010 annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) under the SEAICP for the Company's named executive officers as follows:
 
Performance below threshold would result in no cash bonus payout.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
