Purchase, NY, May 4, 2010
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.3 billion, a 13.1% increase versus the same period in 2009. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 10.2% compared to the same period in 2009. The higher net revenue this quarter benefited from:
 
 
 
 
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 8.7% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2009, to $473 billion. The number of processed transactions increased 4.6% compared to the same period in 2009, to 5.4 billion. As of March 31, 2010, the company's financial-institution customers had issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are starting the year with strength across several of our business drivers, including healthy cross-border volumes, which contributed to our solid first quarter results," said Robert W. Selander, MasterCard chief executive officer. "We also made a number of announcements that position MasterCard well for continued success, including signing a long-term agreement for HSBC's global mass affluent Premier credit business, and the ongoing adoption of MasterCard inControl with Fifth Third, J.P. Morgan and First National Bank of Omaha."
MasterCard president and chief operating officer, Ajay Banga, further remarked, "We're making important investments in innovation, like MasterCard Marketplace, our eCommerce shopping portal, and the launch of MasterCard Labs, a critical component of our global research and development efforts." Banga stated, "We are committed to play a significant role in the evolution of payments to better meet the needs of consumers, merchants, businesses and governments around the world, and look forward to bringing even more developments to the market."

Total operating expenses increased 2.2%, to $608 million, during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 0.5%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a 0.7% decrease in advertising and marketing expenses versus the year-ago period. Excluding currency fluctuations, advertising and marketing expenses declined 3.8%.
The operating margin was 53.5% for the first quarter of 2010, up 4.9 percentage points over the year-ago period.
Total other expense was $5 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $11 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by lower interest expense primarily due to a reduction in interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 34.6% in the first quarter of 2010, versus 33.2% in the comparable period in 2009. The increase was due primarily to an adjustment to the balance of deferred taxes in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by lower state tax rates and more favorable geographic distribution of earnings in the first quarter of 2010.
There were no special items for the first quarter of 2009 or 2010.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
