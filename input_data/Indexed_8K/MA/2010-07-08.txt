The Agreement contains no material terms not otherwise contained in the Initial Agreements or the CEO Offer Letter, each of which have been filed with and described in the Registrant's periodic reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Consistent with the CEO Offer Letter, the Agreement amends and restates and modifies Mr. Banga's original existing employment agreement as follows: the Agreement (1) incorporates the modifications set forth in the CEO Offer Letter; (2) modifies the existing employment agreement to indicate that Mr. Banga has been appointed, and currently serves, as President and Chief Executive Officer of MasterCard; (3) incorporates the provisions of the Original Offer Letter relating to the terms of the second part of his sign-on bonus; and (4) includes clarifications with respect to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the guidance promulgated thereunder.

Once increased, the Executive's base salary may not thereafter be decreased, except if the Compensation Committee determines, in its sole discretion, to reduce the base salary of substantially all members of the Executive Committee of the Company ("EC"), provided, however, in no event shall such reduction(s) of base salary by the Compensation Committee exceed, in the aggregate during the Term of Employment, ten (10%) percent of the Executive's base salary then in effect.

The Company may waive all or part of the ninety (90) day notice required to be given by the Executive hereunder by giving written notice to the Executive. Unless waived by the Company, failure by the Executive to give notice of termination for Good Reason in compliance with this Paragraph, shall render the Executive ineligible to receive the payment and benefits provided under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)-(e).

5.1.7 if within sixty (60) days subsequent to the termination of the Executive's employment for death, Disability, Good Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that the Executive could have been terminated for Cause
 
hereunder, such termination shall be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to the Company.

(d) such additional vested benefits to which the Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of the Executive's employment, payable or made available under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the then existing plans, programs and/or arrangements of the Company, provided, however, in no event shall the Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.5(b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
5.3 Except as expressly provided by Paragraph 5.2, any payment or benefit provided under Paragraph 5.2 hereof shall be in lieu of any other severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to a payment hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to do so.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall continue to be paid the compensation and provided all benefits hereunder in accordance with the regular payroll and benefit practices of the Company, except that the Company's obligation to pay any incentive bonus that would otherwise be payable during the period of suspension shall be held in abeyance pending the conclusion of the Company's investigation. If the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits, which shall be continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is suspended as a result of such charges, but is later acquitted or otherwise exonerated, the Company shall pay to the Executive any compensation withheld pursuant to this Paragraph 5.4, with interest, calculated from the date such compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the Executive is acquitted or exonerated, and provide benefits withheld from the Executive
 
during the period of the Executive's suspension, if any. Such payments and benefits shall be paid and/or provided within thirty (30) days of the date of the Executive's acquittal or exoneration and shall be limited with respect to the period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.
5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the date of termination for purposes of payment of deferred compensation under any Company deferred compensation plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans.

Acknowledgements; Confidential Information; Competitive Activities; Non Solicitation
6.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.1.1 The Company is in the payments industry and provides such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any geographic area.
6.1.2 Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Company or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
6.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
6.2
Confidentiality.
6.2.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its designs, products, methods, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless
 
otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
6.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude the Executive from (i) making any disclosure as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding by or before, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Company's Law Department or the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer in the General Counsel's Office; provided, however, that upon the Executive's obtaining notice of a requirement to take any action pursuant to Section 6.2.2(i) or (ii), the Executive shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Company with immediate written notice of any required disclosures, subpoenas, or any other legal process, which notice shall include a copy of any such disclosure request, subpoena, or other legal process.
6.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that for the Term of Employment through the duration of the Severance Pay Period or in the event the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months, the Executive will not directly or indirectly for himself or any third party invest in, own, become employed by, or render any consulting, advisory or other services to, or for the benefit of, any business or activity that competes with any business or activity (i) engaged in by the Company or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Executive, that the Company has undertaken efforts to engage in and/or plan, without regard to geographic limitation. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to the Executive becoming an investor in, owner of, employed by, or directly or indirectly performing services for the following, including their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors: (i)
 
VISA Inc., VISA Europe, American Express, Discover, China Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club International, PayPal, Revolution, Tempo, Bill Me Later, Inc., First Data Corporation, Metevant, Star Network Inc. or NYCE (ii) any other payment card business or processor; (iii) any company or other entity in the payments business that holds a seat on the Board of Directors of VISA Inc. or VISA Europe; or (iv) any company or other entity that is a party to a brand dedication agreement (the term of which is two years or more) with VISA Inc., VISA Europe or American Express and (x) whose VISA or American Express branded volume, as of the Date of Termination of the Executive's employment, is equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company or (y) pursuant to the terms of such brand dedication agreement is contractually obligated to increase its VISA or American Express branded volume up to an amount equal to or greater than 75% of the total volume generated by cards issued by such company during the term of such brand dedication agreement. Further, it shall not be deemed a violation of the Agreement for the Executive to have beneficial ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete provision set forth herein is intended to limit competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that the scope or duration of any limitation contained herein is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the Executive agrees that the provisions shall instead be construed to be confined to such lesser scope or duration as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitation as so modified.
6.4 During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration of the Severance Pay Period, or in the event that the Executive is ineligible for Severance Pay pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2.3, 5.2.4 or 5.2.5 (g) above or fails to execute (without revocation) a Separation Agreement and Release in accordance with Paragraph 5.2.5(f) above, notwithstanding the Executive's eligibility for Severance Pay, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person to, directly or indirectly, (a) hire or cause to be hired any level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company, (b) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other level 5 or higher level employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the Company for any reason, or (c) induce any customer, supplier or other person with whom the Company is engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products and/or use its services.
6.5 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
6.5.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof, ("Inventions") whether or not patentable, relating to the
 
products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with the Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
6.5.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire "under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
6.6 In the event that the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any further Severance Pay or provide any further payments or benefits otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(b)(d) above, during the remainder of the Severance Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for the Severance Pay previously received from the Company with respect to any period of time during the Severance Pay Period in which the Executive has been found by the court to have been in breach. In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.
6.7 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
6.8 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Company. He
 
further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Paragraph, the Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
7. .
Reimbursement of Business Expense
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
8. .
Indemnity
The Company shall indemnify the Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for any acts or omissions taken or made by the Executive during the Term of Employment, within the scope of his authority under this Agreement.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
9.10 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Executive in connection with his employment termination is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i) of the Code, no part of such payments shall be paid before the day that is six (6) months plus one (1) day after the Date of Termination (such date, the "New Payment Date"). The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Executive during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Executive dies during the period between the Date of Termination and the New Payment Date, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiaries, as the case may be, within thirty (30) days of the Executive's death.

In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and Release shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement and General Release, as applicable), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
