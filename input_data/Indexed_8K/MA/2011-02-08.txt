Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 3, 2011, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") furnished a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Original Form 8-K") disclosing, under Item 7.01, that the Company and its principal operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International", and together with the Company, "MasterCard"), had executed:
 
 
A description of the terms of the Agreements as set forth in the Original Form 8-K is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Original Form 8-K indicated that three parties had not yet signed the Agreements.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
The Agreements are with respect to the current litigations with both the proposed class of merchants and individual merchants that are currently being litigated in the Eastern District of New York ("MDL 1720"), as well as any other potential future case that is transferred at any time for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to MDL 1720 in which the parties are or may become co-defendants (collectively, the "Merchant Litigations"). The Agreements provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which MasterCard, Visa and the Defendant Banks may incur, jointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or global settlement of one or all of the cases in the Merchant Litigations. The Merchant Litigations generally concern allegations by the merchants that, among other things, MasterCard and Visa's purported setting of interchange fees violates antitrust laws. The Merchant Litigations are described in more detail in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
The Omnibus JSA provides that the overall responsibility of MasterCard, Visa and the Defendant Banks for the Merchant Litigations would be divided into a "Visa portion" of 66.6667% and a "MasterCard portion" of 33.3333% in the event of either:
 
 
The MasterCard JSA provides the specific percentage of financial responsibility for MasterCard and the Defendant Banks with respect to the MasterCard portion of any global settlement of, or adverse judgment in, the Merchant Litigations.
With regard to MasterCard's settlement sharing responsibilities under the Agreements:
 
 
With regard to MasterCard's judgment sharing responsibilities under the Agreements:
 
 
MasterCard continues to defend the claims in the Merchant Litigations and the Agreements in no way serve as an admission as to the validity of the allegations in the merchant complaints. MasterCard continues to believe that it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of, or estimate the liability related to, any of the Merchant Litigations. Accordingly, no provision for losses has been provided in connection with the Merchant Litigations.
