 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2011. The company reported net income of $608 million, up 32.8%, and earnings per diluted share of $4.76, up 36.4%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, August 3, 2011
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 22.1% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 18.0%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 16.3% on a local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2010, to $608 billion. As of June 30, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"Solid global performance, including strong increases in volume and processed transactions, fueled double-digit revenue growth this quarter," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "While payment volumes have risen across our base customers, we're also seeing new business such as the portfolio conversions of SunTrust and Sovereign, as well as new processing relationships in the Netherlands and in Brazil, contribute to growth."
Banga said, "During the quarter, work continued in the mobile commerce category highlighted by an agreement with Google and multiple partners to launch the Google Wallet, as well as our alliance with Isis, in the U.S. Additionally, the previously announced Orange and Barclaycard contactless mobile payment service became available to U.K. consumers in May. Other notable agreements we executed include a commercial alliance with China Union Pay to enable its cards for cross-border e-Commerce, and a new, multi-product agreement with Swedbank in the Nordics and Baltics region."

Total operating expenses increased 20.8%, to $782 million, during the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 17.1%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19% and operating expenses grew approximately 14%.
Operating income increased 23.3%, or 18.9% on a constant currency basis, over the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 53.1%, up from 52.6% in the second quarter of 2010.
MasterCard reported other income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus other expense of $4 million in the second quarter of 2010. This change was mainly driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to litigation settlements and lower interest on uncertain tax positions.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.8% in the second quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 35.7% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2011 and discrete adjustments in the second quarter of 2010.
In April 2011, MasterCard's board of directors amended its share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase an incremental $1 billion of class A common stock, bringing the authorization to an aggregate of $2 billion. During the second quarter, MasterCard repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $387 million. Quarter-to-date through July 28, the company repurchased an additional 77,700 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $24 million, with $935 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2011 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $1.2 billion, up 28.2%, and earnings per diluted share of $9.05, up 30.2%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 18.5% versus the same period in 2010, or 16.4% on a constant currency basis. Cross-border volume growth of

18.9%, gross dollar volume growth of 14.7%, transaction processing growth of 14.3% and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 3 percentage points contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Total operating expenses increased 15.3%, to $1.4 billion, for the six-month period compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 13.5%.
Operating margin was 54.3% for the six months ending June 30, 2011, up from 53.0% in the first half of 2010.
Total other income was $7 million for the six-month period versus other expense of $9 million for the same period in 2010. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to litigation settlements and lower interest on uncertain tax positions.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2011, versus a rate of 35.1% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2011.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
