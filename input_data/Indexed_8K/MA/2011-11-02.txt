Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2011. The company reported net income of $717 million, up 38.4%, and earnings per diluted share of $5.63, up 42.9%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, November 2, 2011 
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was $1.8 billion, a 27.3% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 23.8%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 17.2% on a local currency basis versus the third quarter of 2010, to $628 billion. As of September 30, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our strong results this quarter, which were driven by several factors including double-digit increases in volumes and processed transactions in most regions across the globe," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "Debit portfolio conversions in the U.S. and new transaction processing in Brazil and the Netherlands continue to contribute to this growth.
"Economic indicators across the world remain mixed, with the uncertainties in Europe and the United States weighing on sentiment and dominating headlines. Nonetheless, we continue to focus on displacing cash and winning share across markets. We will be adding to our domestic processing in Italy as we have signed a multi-year agreement with a major bank to convert their debit cards to Maestro-only from a co-brand with a domestic scheme. In the U.S., Huntington Bank recently announced a conversion to MasterCard debit cards and will be implementing our IPS platform. We also continue to work with governments around the world, most recently in India and Mexico, to replace some of their paper-based, manual procurement systems with MasterCard commercial products."

Total operating expenses increased 23.1%, to $816 million, during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, operating expenses were up 20.8%. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
 
In the third quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 24% and operating expenses grew approximately 15%.
Operating income increased 30.9%, or 26.3% on a constant currency basis, over the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 55.1%, up from 53.6% in the third quarter of 2010.
MasterCard reported other income of $28 million in the third quarter of 2011 versus other income of $1 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was mainly driven by realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions and a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 30.5% in the third quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 32.3% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the third quarter of 2011.
During the third quarter of 2011, MasterCard repurchased 250,100 shares at a cost of approximately $77 million. Quarter-to-date through October 27, the company repurchased an additional 10,900 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $3 million, with $879 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2011 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $1.9 billion, up 31.9%, and earnings per diluted share of $14.66, up 34.6%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $5.0 billion, an increase of 21.6% versus the same period in 2010, or 19.0% on a constant currency basis. Cross-border volume

growth of 19.1%, gross dollar volume growth of 16.0%, transaction processing growth of 16.5% and the net impact of pricing changes of approximately 3 percentage points contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Total operating expenses increased 18.0%, to $2.3 billion, for the nine-month period compared to the same period in 2010. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 16.0%.
Year-to-date through September 30, 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19% and operating expenses grew approximately 11%.
Operating margin was 54.6% for the nine months ending September 30, 2011, up from 53.2% in the same period last year.
Total other income was $35 million for the nine-month period versus other expense of $8 million for the same period in 2010. The change was mainly driven by realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions and a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, versus a rate of 34.2% in the comparable period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, as well as discrete adjustments recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.

Note that the figures in the preceding tables may not sum due to rounding; growth represents change from the comparable year-ago period

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
