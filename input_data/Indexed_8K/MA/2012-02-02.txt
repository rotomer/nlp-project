Purchase, NY, February 2, 2012
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.7 billion, a 20.2% increase versus the same period in 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 20.8% compared to the same period in 2010. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 15.2% on a local currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2010, to $648 billion. As of December 31, 2011, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results as we are seeing sustained momentum driven by new deals and the ongoing shift away from paper-based payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "For the full year, despite ongoing economic uncertainties, we posted strong performance ahead of our long-term objectives.
"Solid execution at the local level continued to result in new business wins in 2011, with a recent agreement from KeyBank that includes PIN debit and our IPS platform, as well as credit and debit deals with nearly 150 U.S.-based independent banks and credit unions. Additionally, we continue to lay the foundation for growth through strategic partnerships with Western Union, Telefnica and Intel to provide consumers in developed and emerging markets with access to more efficient and safer forms of electronic payments," Banga concluded.

Based on progress to date in mediation related to the U.S. merchant litigations, the company recorded a $770 million pre-tax charge, or $495 million on an after-tax basis, in the fourth quarter of 2011. This special item represents the company's financial portion of a potential settlement in these cases.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 11.5%, to $968 million, during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on operating expense growth. The increase in total operating expenses was driven by:
 
 
Including the special item, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 100.1% versus the year-ago period, to $1.7 billion.
Excluding the special item, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 33.5% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 44.0%.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 18%; excluding acquisitions and the special item, operating expenses grew approximately 8%.
MasterCard reported other expense of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus other income of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income, lower realized gains on sales of investments and equity losses in joint ventures versus the year-ago period.
Excluding the special item, MasterCard's effective tax rate was 32.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus a rate of 28.7% in the comparable period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a benefit recorded in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the current period. Including the special item, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was a 251.6% benefit, as the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations is tax deductible in the U.S. and thus impacted the geographic mix of pre-tax income.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, MasterCard repurchased 84,300 shares at a cost of approximately $30 million. Quarter-to-date through January 27, the company repurchased an additional 304,600 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $106 million, with $746 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.

Full-Year 2011 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2011, MasterCard reported net income of $2.4 billion, or $18.70 per diluted share, excluding a special item, and net income of $1.9 billion, or $14.85 per diluted share, including the special item. The special item represents the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations taken in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Net revenue for full-year 2011 was $6.7 billion, an increase of 21.2% versus 2010. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 19.5%. Cross-border volume growth of 18.7%, gross dollar volume growth of 16.1% and processed transaction growth of 18.3%, contributed to the net revenue growth in the full-year period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives due to increased volumes and new and renewed customer agreements.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 16.0%, to $3.2 billion, for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives and the inclusion of expenses related to acquisitions. Excluding currency fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 14.5%. Including the special item, operating expenses in 2011 increased 43.6%, to $4.0 billion, versus 2010.
For the full-year 2011, excluding acquisitions, net revenue grew approximately 19%; excluding acquisitions and the special item, operating expenses grew approximately 10%.
Excluding the special item, operating income increased 26.6% for 2011 versus 2010 delivering an operating margin of 51.9% for the full-year period. Including the special item, the operating margin was 40.4% for full-year 2011.
Total other income was $33 million for full-year 2011 versus total other income of $5 million in 2010. This was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense due to lower interest accretion related to previous litigation settlements.
MasterCard's effective tax rate, excluding the special item, was 31.8% for full-year 2011, versus a rate of 33.0% for full-year 2010. Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 30.6% for full-year 2011. The decrease in the 2011 effective tax rate was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings, including the tax benefit related to the special item, and the recognition of discrete adjustments in 2011 and 2010.
For full-year 2011, MasterCard repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.
