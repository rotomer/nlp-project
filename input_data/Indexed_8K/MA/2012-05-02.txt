Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2012. The company reported net income of $682 million, up 21%, and earnings per diluted share of $5.36, up 25%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, May 2, 2012
Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a 17% increase versus the same period in 2011. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 19% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 17% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2011, to $629 billion. As of March 31, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"We had a good start to the year with solid first quarter results driven by an increase in processed transactions, the highest quarterly growth rate since our IPO, as well as positive volume growth in all regions as consumers continue to adopt electronic payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and chief executive officer. "We are leveraging opportunities around the world. In the U.S., we have significantly improved our position in debit and now have the capability to process transactions on about half of all U.S. debit cards. Outside of the U.S., the acquisitions of DataCash and Access Prepaid Worldwide are delivering growth, both showing roughly 25% operational increases."
Total operating expenses increased 14%, to $758 million, during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, operating expenses grew 15%. The increase was primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses. Excluding the acquisition of Access Prepaid, net revenue grew approximately 16% and operating expenses grew approximately 9%.

MasterCard's effective tax rate was 31.8% in the first quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 32.8% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings this year.
During the first quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased 652,500 shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. Quarter-to-date through April 26, the company repurchased an additional 112,300 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $49 million, with $556 million remaining under the current repurchase program authorization.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which functional cards are not generally issued. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.
