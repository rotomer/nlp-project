Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On July 13, 2012, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") and its operating subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard International" and, together with the Company, "MasterCard"), entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation in the Eastern District of New York in case captioned MDL 1720. Separately, MasterCard has also reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims brought by the individual merchant plaintiffs.
The MOU sets out a binding obligation to enter into a settlement agreement (the "Class Settlement Agreement") in the form attached to the MOU. The settlement is subject to: (1) the successful completion of certain appendices, (2) the successful negotiation of a settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs, (3) final court approval of the class settlement and (4) any necessary internal approvals for the parties.
MasterCard's share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790 million on a pre-tax basis. As a result, MasterCard will incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its second quarter 2012 financial statements. MasterCard had previously recorded a $770 million charge in its fourth quarter 2011 financial statements. MasterCard's financial obligation was based upon the allocation of financial responsibility that was set out in the judgment and settlement sharing agreements that were executed in February 2011 by the Company, MasterCard International and, as applicable, Visa, Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa International Service Association and MasterCard's customer banks that are parties thereto. Pursuant to those agreements, MasterCard's responsibility is for 12% of a global settlement of the matter. The $790 million obligation represents MasterCard's 12% share of the class settlement set forth in the Class Settlement Agreement of $6.05 billion, along with its 12% share of the cash portion settlement with the individual merchant plaintiffs.
The Class Settlement Agreement includes the following terms, among others:
 
 
 
 
The above description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the MOU, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated
 
herein by reference. The MOU includes a copy of the Class Settlement Agreement which the parties have committed to execute, subject to the conditions described above.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 13, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing that it had entered into the MOU. A copy of the press release, which describes the MOU and the settlement, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)

Funds in those Escrow Account(s) shall be invested solely as provided in Appendices B and C hereto. The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that each Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account and each Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account is intended to be and shall be treated as a Qualified Settlement Fund within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.468B-1 and any analogous local, state, and/or foreign statute, law, regulation, or rule. No signature or approval from the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants shall be required for disbursement from any of the Escrow Account(s) commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date.
7.    All Taxes with respect to any sums in any Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account or any Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account, the administrative costs of paying such Taxes, and any other costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering that Escrow Account shall be paid from that Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent(s).
8.    No payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), or any other use of those Escrow Account(s), shall be made without the prior approval of the Court (which may include approval of payments consistent with proposed budgets and expenses). Class Plaintiffs shall provide Defendants with prior notice of any applications to the Court for such approvals sought up to ten business days
 
after the Settlement Final Date. In no event shall any Defendant, or any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party, have any obligation, responsibility, or liability arising from or relating to the administration, maintenance, preservation, investment, use, allocation, adjustment, distribution, disbursement, or disposition of any funds in the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
Payments to the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
9.      The Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants agree that the Total Cash Payment Amount shall be $6,050,000,000.
10.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, (a) the Visa Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), from the litigation escrow account established under the Visa Defendants' Retrospective Responsibility Plan, two-thirds of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $4,033,333,333), and (b) the MasterCard Defendants and Bank Defendants shall pay by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) a total of one-third of $6,050,000,000 (i.e., $2,016,666,667) in accordance with the agreement among themselves regarding their respective shares.
11.    If this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated prior to the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make a Default Interchange Payment by wire transfer into the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s). Those Default Interchange Payments shall be made within sixty days after the completion of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is not terminated during the eight-month period. If this Class Settlement Agreement terminates during the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, within sixty days of such termination,
 
the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants each shall make their respective Default Interchange Payment based only on the portion of the eight-month period that preceded the date of termination. In the event of a termination of this Class Settlement Agreement after the commencement of the eight-month period described in Paragraphs 12 and 13 below, any Default Interchange Payments made to the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) by the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall be distributed in a manner determined by the Court, if the parties do not enter into a new Class Settlement Agreement addressing such distribution, and in no event shall those Default Interchange Payments revert to the Visa Defendants or MasterCard Defendants or be distributed to Bank Defendants.
12.    The Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the Visa Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same date of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier or, if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the Visa Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the Visa Defendants. The Visa Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default
 
Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the Visa Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for Visa-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any Visa-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the Visa Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
13.    The Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants shall be calculated as follows. Within sixty days after the end of the Class Exclusion Period, the MasterCard Defendants shall reduce the default interchange rates in the manner provided in this Paragraph on United States acquired and issued MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions for a period of eight months (i.e., terminating on the same day of the month as the period commenced eight months earlier, or if no such date exists, the first day of the following month) unless this Class Settlement Agreement is earlier terminated. That reduction shall be effected by the MasterCard Defendants withholding or adjusting 10 basis points from the default interchange amounts that otherwise would be provided to issuers on transactions to which default interchange rates apply. The default interchange thus withheld or adjusted that is attributable to transactions of members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, exclusive of the transactions of the Individual Plaintiffs and Opt Outs, and prior to the date of any termination of this Class Settlement Agreement during the eight-month period described in this Paragraph, shall constitute the Default Interchange Payment of the MasterCard Defendants. The MasterCard Defendants shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with data used to calculate, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, that Default Interchange Payment. During the time period of the interchange reduction provided in this Paragraph, the MasterCard Defendants may not use their network fees to circumvent or evade the reduction in default interchange rates for
 
MasterCard-Branded Credit Card transactions. For purposes of clarity, no modification need be made to any MasterCard-Branded Debit Card default interchange rates or deposits into issuer accounts, and the MasterCard Defendants shall not be required to modify their default interchange rates in any manner not provided in this Paragraph.
14.    Class Plaintiffs reserve their rights to seek appropriate relief from the Court in the event the payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above are not timely made, including but not limited to relief consisting of immediate payment, interest, and penalties.
15.    The payments described in Paragraphs 9-13 above shall exhaust and fully satisfy any and all payment obligations under this Class Settlement Agreement of the Defendants and any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties, and shall extinguish entirely any further obligation, responsibility, or liability to pay any notice expenses, attorneys' fees, litigation costs, costs of administration, Taxes, settlement sums, or sums of any kind to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) or the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), or to the Class Plaintiffs or other members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class (other than those who opt out of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class), or to any of their respective counsel, experts, advisors, agents, and representatives, all of whom shall look solely to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) for settlement and satisfaction of all claims released in this Class Settlement Agreement.
Payments from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s)
16.    Prior to the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of
 
paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs, including the costs of the Notice Plan and the exclusion procedures for Opt Outs as provided in Paragraphs 79-93 below, and additional costs for claims administration, in amounts consistent with the limitations of Paragraph 21(c) below.
17.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 18-20 below, in the amounts stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, regardless of any appeal or other challenge made to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments or their amount. In the event of any appeal concerning the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants stated in the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, and which results in a order determining that those amounts should be modified, within ten business days after the Settlement Final Date the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall pay any amounts to be refunded by wire transfer to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), and the Escrow Agents(s) shall pay any increased amounts due to the Visa Defendants or the MasterCard Defendants into an account that they shall designate.
18.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class
 
Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
19.    Within ten business days after the Settlement Final Approval Date, the Escrow Agent(s) shall make a Class Exclusion Takedown Payment from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate, to be calculated by (a) adding the total dollar sales paid with all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all persons, businesses, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), (b) dividing that sum by the total dollar sales paid with all Visa-Branded Cards plus all MasterCard-Branded Cards in the United States, from January 1, 2004 up to the last day of the month in which the Court enters the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, that are attributable to all members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class plus all persons, business, and other entities that become Opt Outs (other than the Individual Plaintiffs), and then (c) multiplying that quotient by the Total Cash Payment Amount.
20.    In the event that the sum of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments as calculated in Paragraphs 18 and 19 above would exceed twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000), and Defendants do not elect to terminate this Class Settlement Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 97 below, the payments under Paragraphs 18 and 19 above instead shall be calculated as provided in this Paragraph 20. The payment under Paragraph 18 to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (w) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 18(a) by the sum of the sales described in
 
Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (x) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. The payment under Paragraph 19 to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate shall be calculated by (y) dividing the sales described in Paragraph 19(a) by the sum of the sales described in Paragraphs 18(a) and 19(a), and then (z) multiplying that quotient by twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount. Prior to such payments, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants will disclose in writing to Class Counsel the amount of those two payments, which when added together must be equal to twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount (i.e., $1,512,500,000).
21.    From the Settlement Final Approval Date to the date twenty business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments provided in Paragraphs 17-20 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) only in amounts approved by the Court for (a) the costs of maintaining or administering the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), (b) Expense Awards in an amount not to exceed a collective total of $30 million, and (c) further approved Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).
22.    The Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above may be paid only to the law firms that are Class Counsel, which law firms may further disseminate such funds to other law firms representing plaintiffs in the Class Actions, but subject to the terms of this Paragraph. In the event that any Expense Awards of the Court paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) under Paragraph 21 above are overturned or reduced on any appeal or otherwise, or in the event this
 
Class Settlement Agreement is terminated by the date ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, each Class Counsel law firm that received such Expense Awards (whether those Awards were retained or dissemination to other law firms) shall, within ten business days of receiving notice thereof, refund all overturned Expense Awards, or the amount by which any Expense Awards were reduced, to those Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), with interest thereon for the period from payment to refund at the same rate as earned on the funds deposited into the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s), the basis for which rate shall be disclosed to Defendants Any Class Counsel law firm that receives Expense Awards pursuant to Paragraph 21(b) above agrees that it, and each member or shareholder of that law firm, is jointly and severally liable solely for the amount of the Expense Awards that the Class Counsel law firm received and that must be refunded (whether those Awards were retained or disseminated to other law firms), are subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court for the enforcement of the obligation to make such refunds, and are liable for any attorneys' fees and costs that Defendants incur in recovering any such funds that must be refunded, and that the release provided to that law firm in Paragraphs 37 and 73 below shall not extend to any claims regarding such refunds.
.
23.    Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, if this Class Settlement Agreement has not been terminated, and subject to the approval of the Court, the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) may be used for paying Attorney Fee Awards, Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and Expense Awards not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above, as approved by the Court.
24.    Commencing the day after ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, and subject to the payments provided in Paragraphs 16-23 above, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) in amounts approved by the Court
 
based on applications filed with the Court and served on the Defendants, including for paying (a) the timely and proper claims of Authorized Cash Claimants pursuant to the Plan of Administration and Distribution approved by the Court, and (b) Settlement Administration Costs not already paid pursuant to Paragraph 21 above that are approved by the Court.
25.    Until ten business days after the Settlement Final Date, the Escrow Agent(s) may make payments from the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) only in the amounts approved by the Court, and only to pay for (a) the costs of establishing, maintaining, or administering the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s) (including Taxes and the administrative costs of paying such Taxes), and (b) Settlement Administration Costs in amounts not to result in a collective total for all Settlement Administration Costs that would exceed $30 million from both the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) and the Class Settlement Interchange Escrow Account(s).

27.    Notwithstanding anything in Paragraphs 6-26 above, in the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated as provided in Paragraphs 96-98 below, the Escrow Agent(s) shall promptly pay two-thirds of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and already paid or incurred, to an account that the Visa Defendants shall designate, and shall promptly pay one-third of any sums in the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s), less any
 
Taxes due and Settlement Administration Costs approved by the Court and paid or incurred, to an account that the MasterCard Defendants shall designate.

35.    Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party covenants and agrees that it shall not, hereafter, seek to establish, or permit another to act for it in a representative capacity to seek to establish, liability against any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties based, in whole or in part, upon any conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 31-34 above.

(b)    standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty, misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 31-35 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or
 
any other Rule fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 31-35 above; or

In the event that Visa takes action against a merchant's acquirer or the merchant for the merchant's failure to comply with the provisions of Paragraph 42 above, Visa shall provide notice of Visa's action to Class Counsel or their designee.

MasterCard's existing compliance rules and standards, including specifically MasterCard Rules 5.2.2 and 5.10. In the event that MasterCard takes action against a merchant's acquirer or the merchant for the merchant's failure to comply with the provisions of Paragraph 55 above, MasterCard shall provide notice of MasterCard's action to Class Counsel or their designee.
62.    No later than thirty days after the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date, and before any modifications of the MasterCard Defendants' operating regulations necessary to effect Paragraphs 54-56 above become effective, the MasterCard Defendants shall (a) post on the MasterCard website a written notification that describes those modifications, (b) provide that written notification to all MasterCard issuers and acquirers in the United States, and (c) and direct MasterCard acquirers in the United States to provide that written notification to all merchants with whom they have acquiring relationships. The MasterCard Defendants agree to provide Class Counsel with an opportunity to offer comments on the language of that written notification.
63.    Nothing in the foregoing changes to the MasterCard Defendants' rules, by-laws, and/or operating regulations described in Paragraphs 53-58 above shall affect any obligation of any member of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class to comply with all applicable state or federal laws, including but not limited to state laws regarding surcharging of credit or debit card transactions, and federal and state laws regarding deceptive or misleading disclosures.
64.    Nothing in this Class Settlement Agreement shall limit the ability of any MasterCard Defendant to set interchange rates, whether default rates or rates applicable (either by rule or negotiated agreement) to individual merchants, groups of merchants, or merchant trade associations.
 
65.    Nothing in this Class Settlement Agreement shall impose any limitation upon any other conduct of any Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Defendant not expressly modified by the terms hereof.

(d)    any actual or alleged agreement (i) between or among any Visa Defendant and any MasterCard Defendant, (ii) between or among any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant and any other Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party or Parties, or (iii) between or among any Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, or any other Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party or Parties relating to conduct or Rules of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant;

(f)      any service of an employee or agent of any Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party on any board or committee of any Visa Defendant or MasterCard Defendant;

and it is expressly agreed, for purposes of clarity, without expanding or limiting the foregoing, that any claims based on or relating to (a)-(i) above are claims that were or could have been alleged in this Action.
Provided, however, that any Opt Out that is also a member of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall not be deemed to have released any claims for damages based on any
 
Rules or other conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party prior to the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order.
69.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further expressly and irrevocably waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles and releases, any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party may have or that may be derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the release contained in the preceding Paragraphs 66-68. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party expressly and irrevocably waives and releases any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party might otherwise have in relation to the release by virtue of the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or similar laws of any other state or jurisdiction. SECTION 1542 PROVIDES: "CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY GENERAL RELEASE. A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." In addition, although each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party may hereafter discover facts other than, different from, or in addition to those that it or he or she knows or believes to be true with respect to any claims released in the preceding Paragraphs 66-68, each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party hereby expressly waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles, discharges, and releases, any known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or non-contingent claims within the scope of the preceding Paragraphs 66-68, whether or not concealed or hidden, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such other,
 
different, or additional facts. Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall be deemed by operation of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Class Settlement Agreement.
70.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party covenants and agrees that it shall not, hereafter, seek to establish, or permit another to act for it in a representative capacity to seek to establish, liability against any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties based, in whole or in part, upon any conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-69 above.
71.    For purposes of clarity, it is specifically intended for the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-70 above to preclude all members of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class from seeking or obtaining any form of declaratory, injunctive, or equitable relief, or damages or other monetary relief relating to the period after the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order with respect to any Rule of any Visa Defendant or any MasterCard Defendant, and the compliance by any Bank Defendant with any such Rule, as it is alleged to exist, now exists, may be modified in the manner provided in Paragraphs 40-45 and 53-57 above, or may in the future exist in the same or substantially similar form thereto.
72.    For avoidance of doubt, no other provision of this Class Settlement Agreement releases any claim of a Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on:
(a)    breach of this Class Settlement Agreement;
(b)    standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty,
 
misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant's acceptance of Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 66-71 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or any other Rule, fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 66-71 above;
(c)    the claims alleged in the currently operative complaints against the current defendants in (i) , No. 11-CV-02075-RJL (D.D.C.), and (ii) , No. 04-CV-02676-CRB (N.D. Cal) (including claims that have been asserted to have been alleged in the Second Amended or Third Amended Complaints against Bank of America, N.A.); or
NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
(d)    a claim seeking only injunctive relief against only the Visa Defendants regarding the legality of Visa's Fixed Acquirer Network Fee.
73.    Each Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Releasing Party further releases each of the Visa Defendants, MasterCard Defendants, and Bank Defendants and their counsel and experts in this Action from any claims relating to the defense of this Action, including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement. Each Visa Defendant, MasterCard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Class Plaintiffs, other plaintiffs in the Class Actions, Class Counsel, Class Plaintiffs' other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions,
 
including the negotiation and terms of this Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Class Settlement Agreement.
74.    In the event that this Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 96-98 below, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 66-73 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.
Preliminary Court Approval
75.    Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and Defendants agree to use reasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate the Court's preliminary approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, including filing necessary motion papers and scheduling any necessary hearings for a date and time that are convenient for the Court.
76.    Separately from any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, the Class Plaintiffs and Class Counsel agree to file with the Court a motion and supporting papers seeking preliminary approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, after providing Defendants with at least ten days advance notice of the contents of those papers, and to seek the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order in the form in Appendix D hereto, which will:
(a)    Preliminarily approve this Class Settlement Agreement as being within the range of a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and applicable law, and consistent with due process.
(b)    Approve the provisional certification of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class defined in Paragraph 2 above for settlement purposes only, and declare that in the event of termination of this Class Settlement Agreement, certification of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class shall
 
automatically be vacated and each Defendant may fully contest certification of any class as if no Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class had been certified.
(c)    Appoint as Class Counsel the law firms of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., Berger & Montague, P.C., and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.
(d)    Appoint as the Class Administrator to assist Class Counsel in effectuating and administering the Notice Plan and the exclusion process for Opt Outs, in analyzing and evaluating the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments and the Default Interchange Payments, and in effectuating and administering the claims process for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
            
(e)    Determine that notice should be provided to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, but that exclusion rights should be afforded only to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.
(f)    Approve the method of notice to be provided to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and budget contained in Appendix E hereto, including use of the long-form website and mail notice and the publication notice contained in Appendix F hereto, and direct any further notice (and expenses therefor) that the Court may find necessary to provide due process.
(g)    Approve the procedures in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and below for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class to become Opt Outs and exclude themselves from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and including the provision of the information specified in Paragraph 84 below, and approve the procedures in substantially the form described in the Notice Plan and below for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class or the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class to object to this Class Settlement Agreement.
 
(h)    Schedule a final approval hearing for a time and date convenient for the Court at least two hundred eighty five days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, at which hearing the Court will conduct an inquiry into the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of this Class Settlement Agreement and address any objections to it, and determine whether this Class Settlement Agreement and the Plan of Administration and Distribution should be finally approved, and whether to approve any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, and Class Plaintiffs' Awards.
(i)    Stay all further proceedings in this Action as between the Class Plaintiffs or any other plaintiff in a putative class action consolidated in MDL 1720, and the Defendants or any other defendant in a putative class action consolidated in MDL 1720, except for proceedings in MDL 1720 related to effectuating and complying with this Class Settlement Agreement, pending the Court's determination of whether this Class Settlement Agreement should be finally approved or the termination of this Class Settlement Agreement.
(j)    Enjoin the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, pending the Court's determination of whether this Class Settlement should finally be approved or the termination of this Class Settlement Agreement, from challenging in any action or proceeding any matter covered by this Class Settlement Agreement or its release and covenant not to sue provisions, except for (i) proceedings in MDL 1720 related to effectuating and complying with this Class Settlement Agreement, and (ii) any Opt Out's claims for damages based on any conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party prior to the date of the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order.
77.    Prior to forty five days before the end of the Class Exclusion Period and Class Objection Period specified in Paragraphs 83 and 85 below, Class Counsel will file all motion and

(a)    Confirms that the Notice Plan was carried out and that the website notice, mail notice, publication notice, and any other notice to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class was provided in the manner directed by the Court.
(b)    Identifies the date when the Case Website was fully established and its content made available to the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, the date or dates on which mail notices were mailed, the dates of the publication notices, and the date or dates of any other notice directed by the Court.
(c)    Lists each member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class that sought to become an Opt Out and be excluded from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, and on what date the request to be excluded was postmarked and received, and states whether the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class member's request for exclusion was timely and properly made.
(d)    Attaches a copy of all documentation concerning each request for exclusion that the Class Administrator received, with any taxpayer identification number, or other confidential information filed under seal with the Court.
90.    After receipt of the Class Administrator's report and its supporting documentation, the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments will be determined as follows:
(a)    Within fifteen days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants shall provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with a report that calculates, based on the Opt Outs, the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments that should be made to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants pursuant to Paragraphs 17-20 above. The Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants also shall identify and provide Class Counsel and the Class Administrator with the data used to make, and sufficient to analyze and evaluate, those calculations. It is intended for the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to account fully for all the Opt Outs to the extent
 
possible, but Opt Out data that cannot be determined or estimated in any reasonable manner shall not be included for the purposes of calculating the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments under Paragraphs 18(a) or 19(a) above.
(b)    Class Counsel may, at its option, request that the Class Administrator provide, within fifteen days after receiving the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, an analysis and evaluation of the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, including all of its assumptions, data sources, and conclusions, and/or request that the Class Administrator prepare an independent report calculating the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments that should be made to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants.
(c)    In the event that within thirty days after receiving the report of the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants  i.e., within approximately two hundred forty days after the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order  the Class Plaintiffs and the Defendants have not resolved all differences regarding the amount of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to be made to the Visa Defendants and the MasterCard Defendants, they shall submit their dispute to the Court for resolution in connection with the final approval hearing, so that the Court's Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment may identify each Opt Out and state the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments to be made, respectively, to the Visa Defendants and to the MasterCard Defendants from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s) as provided in Paragraphs 17-20 above.
91.    The Class Administrator's expenses for the foregoing notice and exclusion activities, including those of any third-party vendors it uses to perform tasks necessary for the implementation or effectuation of its duties, shall be paid from the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account(s). In no event shall any Defendant, Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party, or
 
Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class Released Party have any obligation, responsibility, or liability with respect to the Class Administrator, the Notice Plan, or the exclusion procedures for members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, including with respect to the costs, administration expenses, or any other charges for any notice and exclusion procedures.
92.    Class Counsel may, upon notice to the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class in the manner approved by the Court, seek Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards. Class Counsel intend to apply for an Attorneys' Fee Award in an amount that is a reasonable percentage of the Total Cash Payment Amount and for Expense Awards comprising all reasonable expenses and costs incurred, which requested amounts will be disclosed in the mail, publication, and other notices provided to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class. Class Counsel reserve the right to make additional applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards for fees and expenses incurred after the Preliminary Approval Date, including for achieving the Settlement Final Approval Date and Settlement Final Date, and for the administration of this Class Settlement Agreement. Class Counsel shall allocate any Attorneys' Fee Awards and Expense Awards among counsel for the Class Plaintiffs and counsel for other plaintiffs in the Class Actions in a manner which they in good faith believe reflects the contribution of those counsel to the prosecution and settlement of the Class Actions in this Action.
93.    The Court may consider any applications for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards separately from a motion for preliminary or final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, and may enter orders regarding such applications separately from the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment. Any rehearing, reconsideration, vacation, review, appeal, or any other action taken regarding only a separate order concerning only an application for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, and not in
 
any way concerning the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment, shall not delay the Settlement Final Date that otherwise would occur with respect to the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment.
Final Court Approval
94.    Upon the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order, the Class Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Defendants agree to use reasonable and good faith efforts to effectuate the Court's final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, including filing the necessary motion papers and scheduling any necessary hearings for a date and time that are convenient for the Court.
95.    Separately from any motions for Attorneys' Fee Awards, Expense Awards, or Class Plaintiffs' Awards, the Class Plaintiffs agree to file with the Court a motion and supporting papers seeking final approval of this Class Settlement Agreement, after providing Defendants with at least ten days advance notice of the contents of those papers, and to seek the Court's entry of the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment in the form in Appendix G hereto, which will:

.
(m)    Determine that there is no just reason for delay in entering the final judgment, and direct that the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment shall be final and appealable.

97.    Defendants as a group may terminate this Class Settlement Agreement by providing written notice to the other parties and the Court within ten business days after determining that the sum of the Class Exclusion Takedown Payments calculated under Paragraphs 18 and 19 above, without regard to Paragraph 20 above, would exceed twenty-five percent of the Total Cash Payment Amount.

112.    This Class Settlement Agreement constitutes the entire, complete, and integrated agreement between and among the Class Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class and the Rule 23(b)(2) Settlement Class, and the Defendants with
 
respect to the settlement of the Class Actions. All of the Appendices to this Class Settlement Agreement are material and integral parts of it and are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Inc. entitled to vote thereon.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) has agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to settle the current U.S. merchant class litigation. The MOU has been executed by all of the defendants  which include MasterCard, Visa and a number of banks  and the court-appointed class counsel for the merchants. Separately, MasterCard has reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims brought by the individual merchant plaintiffs.
Purchase, N.Y.,  July 13, 2012
After execution of both settlement agreements and upon final approval of the class settlement by the court, MasterCard will have resolved all pending U.S. merchant litigations concerning the company's interchange structure and merchant acceptance rules.
"Our decision to settle is based on our belief that MasterCard and our stakeholders are best served by an amicable resolution," said Noah Hanft, MasterCard's General Counsel and Chief Franchise Integrity Officer. "Although we have strong defenses to all claims, a settlement avoids years of litigation and uncertainties that are inherent in such cases. We believe that today's settlements should resolve all issues with the merchant community."
MasterCard's share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790 million on a pre-tax basis. As a result, the company will incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its second quarter 2012 financial statements. MasterCard had previously recorded a $770 million charge in its fourth quarter 2011 financial statements.
U.S. merchant class members will receive a 10 basis points reduction in credit interchange rates for eight months, which will be implemented by MasterCard withholding this amount from U.S. issuers. In addition, the settlement agreement requires that MasterCard negotiate in good faith with any lawful merchant buying group in an effort to reach a commercially reasonable agreement.
MasterCard will also be required to make modifications to its No Surcharge Rule to allow U.S. merchants the ability to impose checkout fees on credit cards, subject to certain conditions that are intended to protect cardholders. Merchants have agreed to provide consumers with disclosures and limit the level and circumstances in which they may impose checkout fees on a cardholder which are designed to avoid unfair, unexpected or exorbitant fees.
There are also provisions in the settlement that prevent MasterCard cardholders from being unfairly targeted with checkout fees relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as American Express, Discover and PayPal, should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging. State laws that may limit or prohibit surcharging are not impacted by this agreement.

"We know that merchants care about their customers and anticipate that they will not impose checkout fees, particularly because the value merchants derive from card acceptance far exceeds their costs," said Hanft. "However, throughout the litigation and as a condition for resolution, the merchant plaintiffs sought a change to the current rule and we focused our efforts in settlement negotiations to ensure consumer safeguards were included."
The settlements will provide MasterCard and its customer financial institutions with a broad release of all claims that were alleged, or could have been alleged by the merchants concerning MasterCard's interchange structure and merchant acceptance rules, as well as the future effect of MasterCard's existing rules and practices. In agreeing to the settlement, MasterCard in no way admits to any improper conduct with respect to the plaintiffs' allegations. All business and rule practice changes will occur after preliminary approval of the settlement, most likely in late 2012 or early 2013.
The merchant litigations and the impact to MasterCard are described in more detail in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2011.
