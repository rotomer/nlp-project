Purchase, NY, August 1, 2012
Net revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.8 billion, a 9% increase versus the same period in 2011. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 13% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 13% on a local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2011, to $661 billion. As of June 30, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"Though economic uncertainties continued to persist, we experienced solid volume and processed transaction growth in all regions as we are focused on driving our global business to expand the reach of electronic payments," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "We are executing on strategic partnerships as demonstrated by our recent announcement with Deutsche Telekom and the completion of AliPay's integration with the DataCash payment platform, which will expand AliPay's reach to online retailers outside of China. We also continue to work with government entities around the world, like the South African Social Security Agency, to help them implement more efficient and secure ways to deliver social benefits and to increase transparency and financial inclusion."

Based on the company's decision to enter into settlement agreements in the U.S. merchant litigations, the company recorded a $20 million pre-tax charge, or $13 million on an after-tax basis, in the second quarter of 2012. This special item is incremental to the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reflect the company's total financial portion of $790 million in the settlement of these cases.
Excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 6%, to $826 million in the second quarter of 2012. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses increased 9%. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives. Including the special item, total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2012 increased 8% versus the year-ago period, to $846 million.
Excluding the special item, operating income for the second quarter of 2012 increased 12% over the year-ago period and the company delivered an operating margin of 54.6%.
MasterCard reported other expense of $1 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus other income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change was primarily driven by increased expenses from investments in joint ventures.
Including the special item, the effective tax rate was 28.0% in the second quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 31.8% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to discrete benefits relating to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions. A more favorable geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the decrease.
During the second quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $671 million. Quarter-to-date through July 26, the company repurchased an additional 132,250 shares at a cost of approximately $57 million, with $1.4 billion remaining under the most recent $1.5 billion repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2012 Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, MasterCard reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $11.01 per diluted share, excluding the special item from the second quarter of 2012. Including the special item, diluted earnings per share was $10.91.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 13% versus the same period in 2011, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Gross dollar volume growth of 17%, transaction processing growth of 29% and cross-border volume growth of 18% contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.

Accordingly, except for the company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forward-looking information to reflect actual results of operations, changes in financial condition, changes in estimates, expectations or assumptions, changes in general economic or industry conditions or other circumstances arising and/or existing since the preparation of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.
