7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On September 20, 2012, MasterCard Incorporated (the "Company") will host a meeting for members of the investment community. As part of discussions at the meeting, the Company is providing the following 2013-2015 longer-term performance objectives (on a constant currency basis and excluding future acquisitions):
 
At the meeting, the Company will provide additional context with respect to the above performance objectives, including its expectations around the currently weak global economic environment. The Company also assumes that there will not be any further deterioration in the U.S. economy or more significant problems within the Eurozone. Based on these expectations, the Company expects that net revenue growth in the early part of the 2013-2015 period may be slightly below the 11-14% range and, in later years, net revenue growth could be at the higher end of this range, assuming that the global economy could return to a more stable environment.
Presentation materials for the meeting are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The descriptions of longer-term performance objectives set forth above and all information set forth in the attached presentation materials is furnished but not filed.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
