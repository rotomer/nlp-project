Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012. The company reported net income of $772 million, up 8%, and earnings per diluted share of $6.17, up 10%, in each case versus the year-ago period.
Purchase, NY, October 31, 2012
Net revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $1.9 billion, a 5% increase versus the same period in 2011. Adjusted for currency, net revenue increased 10% compared to the same period in 2011. Net revenue growth was driven by the impact of the following:
 
 
 
These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.
Worldwide purchase volume during the quarter was up 12% on a local currency basis versus the third quarter of 2011, to $676 billion. As of September 30, 2012, the company's customers had issued 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
"MasterCard continues to drive solid financial performance and focus on executing key deals, investments and partnerships," said Ajay Banga, MasterCard president and CEO. "We won significant business in Europe this quarter with Nordea, Credit Agricole and CSOB in the Czech Republic and, in the U.S., we acquired loyalty reward provider Truaxis to better connect consumers with targeted, relevant offers.
"Additionally, emerging geographies and governments continue to provide great opportunities for growth. In Africa, our win with Nakumatt, the largest supermarket chain in East Africa, is expected to deliver more than a million multi-currency prepaid loyalty cards to consumers. We also continue to support governments around the world, including new programs in the U.S. and Mexico with several large government agencies that help save money and deliver more effective and efficient programs and benefits," Banga concluded.

Total operating expenses increased 5%, to $854 million in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted for currency, operating expenses increased 8%. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2012 increased 6% over the year-ago period, and the company delivered an operating margin of 55.5%.
MasterCard reported other income of $2 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus other income of $28 million in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions in last year's third quarter and increased expenses from investments in joint ventures.
The effective tax rate was 27.6% in the third quarter of 2012, versus a rate of 30.5% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete benefit related to additional export incentives and a benefit from a deduction related to the Company's authorization software.
During the third quarter of 2012, MasterCard repurchased approximately 500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $216 million. Quarter-to-date through October 25, the company repurchased approximately 255,000 additional shares at a cost of approximately $119 million, with $1.1 billion remaining under the most recent $1.5 billion repurchase program authorization.
Year-to-Date 2012 Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, MasterCard reported net income of $2.2 billion, or $17.18 per diluted share, excluding a special item taken in the second quarter for an incremental $13 million after-tax charge related to the U.S. merchant litigations. Including the special item, diluted earnings per share was $17.07.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 10% versus the same period in 2011, or 14% adjusted for currency. Gross dollar volume growth of 16%, transaction processing growth of 27% and cross-border volume growth of 16% contributed to the net revenue growth in the year-to-date period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements and increased volumes.
Excluding the special item, operating expenses increased 8%, to $2.4 billion, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to higher personnel costs related to strategic initiatives. Excluding currency fluctuations and the special item, total operating expenses increased 10%. Including the special item in the second quarter, total operating expenses increased 9%.
Excluding the special item, operating income increased 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 versus the same period in 2011, delivering an operating margin of 55.6%.

MasterCard reported no other income/expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, versus other income of $35 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower realized gains on sales of investments, increased expenses from investments in joint ventures and an adjustment to acquisition-related provisions made in last year's third quarter.
MasterCard's effective tax rate was 29.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, including the special item, compared to a rate of 31.6% in the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions.

Accordingly, except for the company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, the company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the forward-looking information to reflect actual results of operations, changes in financial condition, changes in estimates, expectations or assumptions, changes in general economic or industry conditions or other circumstances arising and/or existing since the preparation of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events.

Footnote
The tables set forth the gross dollar volume ("GDV"), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts, cards and acceptance locations on a regional and global basis for MasterCard-branded and MasterCard Electronic-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
Debit transactions on Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards, Mondex transactions and transactions involving brands other than MasterCard are not included in the preceding tables.
For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; "purchase volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and "cash volume" means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. Acceptance locations include merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be obtained.
The MasterCard payment product is comprised of credit, charge and debit programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. Debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale is for cardholders either to sign a sales receipt or enter a PIN. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving MasterCard-branded cards that are not processed by MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues.
Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the accounts and cards columns is provided by MasterCard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. In order to provide a true indication of how broadly our cards can be used, MasterCard seeks to provide the most accurate acceptance figures possible and to maintain that MasterCard acceptance is unsurpassed worldwide by periodically validating our results with third parties. The data set forth in the acceptance locations column is derived through a proprietary methodology designed to minimize the impact of multiple acquiring in certain markets. This data is based on information provided by our customers and other third parties and is subject to certain limited verification by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard's transaction processing systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCard's customers subsequent to the date of its release.
In 2012, certain MasterCard Debit and Credit Programs in the Europe region have changed due to a reclassification of programs. There is no impact at the All MasterCard Programs level. In addition, Purchase Transactions for certain Credit Programs in the Latin America region have been restated due to revisions from several customers. MasterCard revenue is not impacted from these changes. Data for the comparable periods in 2012, 2011 and 2010 have been restated to be consistent with these approaches.
Performance information for prior periods can be found in the "Investor Relations" section of MasterCard's website at www.mastercard.com.
