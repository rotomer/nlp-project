MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL REPORTS EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  OF $0.36 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, UP 13% FROM 2002
 
WASHINGTON, D.C.  April 24, 2003  Marriott International, Inc. (NYSE:MAR) today reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.36 in the first quarter of 2003, up 13 percent from the 2002 first quarter. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, for the quarter was $87 million, up from $82 million a year ago. Synthetic fuel operations contributed approximately $19 million after-tax ($0.08 per share) during the first quarter of 2003 compared to $2 million after-tax ($0.01 per share) in the prior year quarter.
 
J.W. Marriott, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, "Although the lodging industry felt the negative effects of the soft global economy compounded by the war in Iraq in the first quarter, Marriott continued to benefit from its business model and strong balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2003, our base management and franchise fees were up $8 million, or 6 percent, from a year-ago. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares of Marriott International stock since year end 2002 for a total cost of $174 million.
 
"In difficult times like these, owners and franchisees continue to select the strongest brands. With our partners, we added 8,028 rooms to our system in the first quarter. Roughly 35 percent (2,844 rooms) of these rooms were conversions of existing hotels to one of our brands. We remain confident that our management and franchise strategy, combined with our strong brands, will provide sustainable growth in market share and profits over the long term."
 
MARRIOTT LODGING profits decreased $6 million, or 4 percent, to $147 million during the first quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting the absence of a timeshare note sale transaction in the
 
quarter. Timeshare note sale gains were $14 million in the first quarter of 2002. Incentive management fees declined $3 million during the quarter to $29 million as lower house profit margins reduced profitability at the unit level.
 
For the 2003 first quarter (January 4  March 28), revenue per available room (REVPAR) for comparable company-operated North American properties decreased by 1.5 percent, driven entirely by lower average room rates. Company-operated full-service hotels (includingand) experienced a REVPAR decrease of 1.7 percent in the 2003 first quarter, while Marriott's company-operated select-service and extended-stay brands (including , , and) posted a REVPAR decrease of 1.0 percent. Marriott's 2003 fiscal first quarter began on January 4, 2003, while the prior year's first quarter included the New Year's holiday. If calculated on the calendar quarter of January 1 to March 31 for both the 2003 and 2002 first quarters, REVPAR declined by an average of 4.1 percent across Marriott's domestic company-operated hotels during the 2003 first quarter.

Our first quarter profits for international lodging reflected greater strength than in the U.S., with REVPAR up 6.8 percent on a constant dollar basis and improved house profit margins. Lodging demand was particularly strong in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East/Africa and the Caribbean/Latin American regions during the first quarter. Beginning in late March and continuing into April, demand has declined significantly in many Asian markets as a result of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
 
Marriott's timeshare business reported over 15 percent growth in contract sales in the first quarter of 2003. Contract sales were particularly strong at timeshare resorts in Aruba, Hawaii, Arizona, and Jupiter, FL, while the Orlando market continued to be soft. Profits in the timeshare business declined to $18 million in the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to the deferral of a timeshare mortgage note sale to the second quarter. We previously announced our plan to complete two note sales (in the second and fourth quarters) during 2003 versus the smaller transactions in each of the four quarters of 2002.
 
 
We added 35 hotels and timeshare resorts (8,028 rooms) to our worldwide lodging portfolio during the first quarter, while one hotel (104 rooms) and two timeshare resorts (78 rooms) exited the system. Seven (2,357 rooms) opened during the quarter, including the properties in Waikoloa and Wailea, Hawaii that joined us from Outrigger Resorts. Four (1,658 rooms), six (996 rooms), four (684 rooms), and five (536 rooms) also opened during the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the company's lodging group encompassed 2,589 hotels and timeshare resorts (471,275 rooms).

CORPORATE EXPENSES were $30 million in the first quarter of 2003 compared to $29 million a year ago. Interest expense in the 2003 first quarter was $26 million, up $7 million from a year ago, largely as a result of lower capitalized interest. Provisions for loan losses in the first quarter of 2003 were $5 million, related to reserves on two hotels. At the end of the first quarter 2003, total debt (including debt associated with discontinued operations) was $2.2 billion and cash balances totaled $525 million. We owned nine hotels at the end of the 2003 first quarter.
 
We repurchased 4.9 million shares of common stock during the 2003 first quarter at a total cost of $155 million and have repurchased approximately 600,000 shares to date in the second quarter. Currently, our remaining share repurchase authorization totals approximately 18 million shares.
 
We closed our distribution services business in 2002 and completed the sale of our senior living business in the 2003 first quarter. Therefore, we show the financial results for those businesses in discontinued operations for 2002 and 2003. Earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.12 in the first quarter of 2003. Proceeds from the sale of our senior living business and certain related real estate assets were $266 million during the first quarter of 2003 and we recorded a $23 million after-tax gain on disposal in discontinued operations ($0.09 per share).
 
OUTLOOK
 
Based on the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy, the effect of the war in Iraq and the evolving impact of SARS, it is very difficult to forecast future operating performance. Our assumptions for the second quarter are for REVPAR trends and unit
 
 
level profitability to continue at roughly the same levels as the first quarter. We currently estimate that domestic comparable managed REVPAR will decline by approximately four percent in the second quarter compared to 2002 levels and, with continued upward pressure on casualty insurance and medical benefits costs, we expect hotel house profit margins to decline.
 
We expect timeshare profits in the second quarter of 2003 to be between $42 million and $45 million, as a result of a higher gain on the sale of timeshare mortgage notes, offset somewhat by amortization of technology investments and lower interest income from timeshare notes.
 
Given the above assumptions and weaker international lodging profits, we estimate total lodging profits (including timeshare profits) will be $180 million to $190 million in the 2003 second quarter, down slightly from the 2002 second quarter. Including approximately $0.09 in earnings per share from our synthetic fuel operations, we anticipate that earnings per share from continuing operations will total $0.46 to $0.49 per share in the second quarter 2003.
 
For the second half of the year, we believe a fairly wide range of possible lodging demand estimates is appropriate, given the level of economic uncertainty. However, if one assumes that in the third quarter of 2003, the change in domestic comparable managed REVPAR ranges from down two percent to up two percent, no gain on timeshare mortgage note sales and $0.04 to $0.06 of after-tax earnings from synthetic fuel, we estimate EPS from continuing operations will range from $0.30 to $0.34. For the 2003 fourth quarter, assuming REVPAR ranges from flat to up four percent, completion of a timeshare mortgage note sale transaction, and $0.11 to $0.13 of after-tax earnings from our synthetic fuel operation, we estimate EPS will range from $0.64 to $0.68.
 
Under these assumptions, we estimate 2003 EPS from continuing operations, including synthetic fuel, would be $1.76 to $1.87.
 
We continue to expect to add between 25,000 and 30,000 hotel rooms annually in 2003 and 2004 to our worldwide lodging portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, the company's pipeline of properties under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development was over 50,000 rooms, even after opening more than 8,000 rooms in the first quarter.
 
 
We expect investment spending in 2003 to include approximately $40 million for maintenance spending and approximately $100 million for new company-developed hotels. We anticipate timeshare investment spending to total approximately $150$200 million. We also expect to invest $200 million in equity slivers, mezzanine financing and mortgage loans for hotels developed by our partners. We expect that total investment spending in 2003 will be roughly $500$550 million.
