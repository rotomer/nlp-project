ITEM 12. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Marriott International, Inc. (the Company) published its fourth quarter and full year 2003 and 2002 results in a financial statement format which provided detail not included in previously issued reports and reflected the reclassification of certain line items. The Company today is furnishing its Consolidated Statement of Income by Quarter for the Fiscal Years Ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003, in this new format to provide comparable information for the first three quarters of 2003 and 2002. As part of our new income statement format, gains, including timeshare note sale gains, and equity in earnings/losses from our joint ventures are reflected below operating income. In addition, general, administrative and other expenses now reflect general, administrative and other expenses for the entire Company including domestic and international lodging, our ExecuStay business and our timeshare segment, as well as corporate expenses. This new format does not result in any changes to the Company's reported earnings in any quarter. A copy of the Consolidated Statement of Income by Quarter for each of the Fiscal Years Ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003 is attached as Exhibit 99 and incorporated by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC.
