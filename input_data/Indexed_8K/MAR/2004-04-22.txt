WASHINGTON, D.C.  April 22, 2004  Marriott International, Inc. (NYSE:MAR) today reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.47 in the first quarter of 2004, up 31 percent from 2003. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, for the quarter was $114 million, also a 31 percent increase over 2003 levels. Synthetic fuel operations contributed approximately
$11 million ($0.04 per share) in the first quarter versus $19 million ($.08 per share) in the year ago quarter.
 
J.W. Marriott, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, "Results were terrific in the first quarter of 2004 and we are especially pleased to see the increase in worldwide lodging demand. Group bookings and transient demand accelerated steadily through the first quarter and we are encouraged by the indications for the rest of the year as well. When combined with our continued strength in new rooms growth and the timeshare business, we are optimistic that EPS from continuing operations will increase approximately 20 percent this year.
 
"Customers are not just looking; they are booking. Worldwide, travelers are back on the road, going to group meetings, making sales calls and taking family vacations. We saw substantial increases in reservations booked during each week of the quarter and new group bookings substantially exceeded our expectations as well. Across urban, suburban, airport and resort markets, REVPAR increased in the first quarter. Closure rates on our toll-free reservations number and on Marriott.com also hit record highs during the quarter.
 
"Our leisure business deserves special mention. Marriott's industry leading portfolio of more than 100 resort and timeshare destinations had an outstanding performance during the first quarter of 2004. REVPAR for our 44 in-season North American, Mexican, Caribbean and Hawaiian resort hotels was up more than 10 percent and our timeshare business produced record contract sales during the quarter. The destination hotels that we have added to our system during the past several years are showing strong performance gains against their competitive set."
 
In the first fiscal quarter (12 week period from January 3, 2004 to March 26, 2004), REVPAR for comparable systemwide North American properties increased by 5.4 percent, driven by gains in both occupancy and average daily rates. REVPAR at comparable systemwide North American full-service hotels (includingand

) also increased by 5.4 percent during the quarter, while North American systemwide REVPAR for select-service and extended-stay brands (including , , and) posted a REVPAR increase of 5.5 percent. brand in North America experienced stronger demand, particularly at its Florida resort properties, with comparable REVPAR up 10.1 percent for January and February combined. On a quarter calendar basis (January 1- March 31), REVPAR for comparable systemwide North American properties increased by 6.3 percent during the first quarter of 2004.

International REVPAR at comparable systemwide properties increased 13.4 percent (6.4 percent in constant dollars) with strong demand in the Caribbean, Mexico, the Middle East, Asia and the United Kingdom.
 
We added 38 hotels and timeshare resorts (7,380 rooms) to our worldwide lodging portfolio during the first quarter, while three properties (1,024 rooms) exited the system. For the 2004 first quarter, hotels converted from competitor or unbranded hotels accounted for approximately 42 percent of the quarter's hotel room additions (nearly 30 percent excluding Ramada International). At quarter end, the company's lodging group encompassed 2,753 hotels and timeshare resorts (496,920 rooms).
 
MARRIOTT REVENUES totaled $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2004, an 11 percent increase from 2003. Base fees from managed hotels increased 8 percent to $99 million, reflecting 2 percent net growth in managed rooms and 5.6 percent REVPAR growth for worldwide comparable company-operated hotels (in constant dollars). Franchise fees increased 17 percent in the first quarter to
$61 million, reflecting 9 percent net growth in franchised rooms and REVPAR growth. Incentive management fees increased 14 percent to $33 million as a result of REVPAR growth, particularly in our international operations. North American company-operated hotel house profit margins declined slightly during the first quarter because of higher utility and associate benefit costs, and lower telephone profits, offset somewhat by improved productivity. International house profit margins increased during the quarter by
2.5 percentage points. Worldwide, house profit margins improved 0.4 percentage points.
 
Marriott's timeshare business reported 30 percent higher contract sales for the first quarter of 2004, driven by particularly strong seasonal demand for our Marriott Vacation Ownership Club

timeshares in Florida, Hawaii and California as well as our Ritz-Carlton Club fractional ownership product in St. Thomas and Colorado.
 
MARRIOTT'S OPERATING INCOME increased 160 percent in the 2004 first quarter to $151 million from $58 million as a result of the sale of a 50 percent interest in the company's synthetic fuel business in mid-2003 and stronger operating results in the lodging business. Marriott's lodging operating income totaled $151 million, up 29 percent from the year ago quarter, reflecting higher operating profits from the sale of timeshare intervals and higher fees in the hotel business, offset somewhat by higher general and administrative expenses. Marriott's general, administrative and other expenses were $132 million in the first quarter of 2004, up
18 percent from the prior year as a result of higher administrative costs in both our lodging and timeshare businesses, increased legal expenses and $4 million of guarantee charges.
 
INTEREST EXPENSE decreased to $22 million in the first quarter compared to $26 million in 2003, reflecting lower debt levels. Interest income increased to $26 million in the 2004 first quarter reflecting slightly higher average interest rates and loan balances. Provision for loan losses was a positive $3 million as a result of receiving payment on a note that was fully reserved.
 
After - tax EPS from the synthetic fuel business in the first quarter was $0.04 compared to $0.08 a year ago, reflecting the sale of a 50 percent ownership interest in our synthetic fuel business in mid - 2003 and slightly lower production volume. Excluding the impact of our synthetic fuel operations our tax rate for continuing operations was 35.5 percent in the first quarter of 2004.
 
During the 2004 first quarter, we sold real estate totaling $4 million and a mezzanine hotel loan for $57 million. We owned only seven hotels at the end of the first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter of 2004 was $1.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of 2003. Cash balances at the end of the quarter were $195 million. During the first quarter, we repurchased
 
Exhibit 99
Page 5
 
6.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $294 million. To date in the second quarter, we have repurchased nearly
800,000 shares of common stock. Five million shares remain authorized for repurchase.
 
During 2003, we closed the distribution services business and sold our senior living business. Therefore, we show the financial results for those businesses in discontinued operations for 2004 and 2003. There were no earnings or losses from discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2004 compared to diluted EPS of $0.12 in the year ago quarter.
 
Regarding our business segment results, full service lodging results for the first quarter of 2004 increased to $100 million from
$95 million a year ago as a result of higher fees, partially offset by increased administrative costs and pre-opening costs for two hotels. Select service and extended stay lodging results were roughly flat year over year as increased fees were offset by $4 million of guarantee charges and lower profits at hotels under renovation. Timeshare results more than doubled to $50 million in the first quarter reflecting a 40 percent increase in financially reportable interval sales and substantially higher margins. Timeshare margins benefited from leveraging fixed costs on higher sales and a greater proportion of luxury projects.
 
OUTLOOK
 
We are pleased with the growing group and transient demand as well as the outlook in our timeshare business for the rest of 2004. In addition, we expect to benefit from the comparison to last year because of the impact of both the war in Iraq and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ("SARS") in 2003. Based on these dynamics, we have increased our estimate of 2004 systemwide comparable North American REVPAR growth to a range of 6 to 8 percent.
 
We expect house profit margins to improve modestly in 2004. We also expect to complete timeshare mortgage note sale transactions in the second and fourth quarters, open approximately 25,000 to 30,000 new rooms, and earn roughly $0.38 to $0.42 of after-tax earnings per share from our synthetic fuel business. Under these assumptions, our lodging operating income is expected to increase roughly 25 percent to a range of $590 million to $610 million for full year 2004. As a result, we are raising our 2004 estimate of EPS from continuing operations to a range of $2.24 to $2.34.
 
Exhibit 99

For the second quarter, assuming North American systemwide comparable REVPAR growth of between 7 to 9 percent, we currently estimate lodging operating income of $145 million to $155 million, compared to $110 million in the 2003 second quarter. Second quarter EPS from continuing operations are estimated to range from $0.59 to $0.61, including $0.10 of earnings from synthetic fuel.
 
We expect investment spending in 2004 to include approximately $50 million for maintenance capital spending and approximately $50 million for systems initiatives. We also expect to invest approximately $25 million in new company-developed hotels and
$75 million in the timeshare business. We expect to invest approximately $150 million in mezzanine financing and mortgage loans for hotels developed by our owners and franchisees and approximately $150 million in equity investments, including investments in timeshare joint ventures. In 2004, we estimate total investment spending levels to be roughly $500 million, moderately lower than in 2003.
