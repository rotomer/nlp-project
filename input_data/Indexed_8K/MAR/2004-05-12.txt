ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
 
On April 7, 2004, Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott") sent notice to the holders of its Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (Zero CouponSenior) (the "Notes"), that, subject to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, it would purchase for cash, at the option of each holder, any Notes tendered by the holder and not withdrawn on May 10, 2004, at a purchase price of $880.50 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. Marriott issued the Notes, which carried a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent, on May 8, 2001.
 
Holders of all outstanding Notes, approximately $70 million aggregate principal amount at maturity, tendered their Notes for repurchase. Accordingly, on May 11, 2004, Marriott repurchased all of the outstanding Notes for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $62 million.
 
No Notes remain outstanding following the purchase. Because the outstanding Notes had been convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of Marriott's Class A Common Stock, Marriott's fully diluted shares will decrease as a result of the purchase.
 
A copy of Marriott's press release is attached as Exhibit 99 and incorporated by reference.
