ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On October 6, 2004, Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott") entered into amendment agreements with its synthetic fuel partner (amending agreements filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.6 to Marriott's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 20, 2003) that result in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us. On the synfuel facility that is not being reviewed by the IRS, our partner will increase its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent for the next six months and pay a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits. With respect to the three synfuel facilities under IRS review, our partner will reduce its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to an average of roughly 5 percent during the next six months. If the IRS' placed-in-service challenge regarding the three facilities is not successfully resolved by March 31, 2005, our partner will have the right to return its ownership interest in those three facilities to Marriott at that time. If there is a successful resolution by March 31, our partner's share of the tax credits from all four facilities will return to approximately 50 percent. In any event, on March 31, 2005, our share of the tax credits from the one facility not under review will return to approximately 50 percent.
