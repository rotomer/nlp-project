Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On October 28, 2005, our synthetic fuel partner exercised its option to have us redeem its approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the three synthetic fuel facilities owned by Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises II, LLC ("SAFE II") effective on December 31, 2005. As a result, as of January 1, 2006, we will own all of the interests in those three facilities and receive all of the tax credits associated with those facilities. The total consideration for such redemption will be that our synthetic fuel partner is relieved of the obligation to pay the remaining balance of $8 million on the promissory note issued in connection with the purchase of its ownership interest in SAFE II in 2003 and all further obligations to make earn-out payments with respect to SAFE II for periods after January 1, 2006. Following such redemption, we will no longer report the Agreement for Purchase of Membership Interest in SAFE II, as amended, and the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Agreement of SAFE II, as amended, as material contracts.
 
We will continue to own approximately 50 percent of the ownership interests in the one synthetic fuel facility owned by Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises I, LLC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
