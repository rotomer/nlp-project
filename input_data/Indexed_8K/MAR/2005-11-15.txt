Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 10, 2005, in connection with its issuance of its 5.81 percent Series G Notes due November 10, 2015 (the "New Notes") described in Item 2.03, Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott") and the dealer managers for the New Notes entered into a registration rights agreement dated November 10, 2005 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). The New Notes are represented by a global note, executed by Marriott, dated November 10, 2005 (the "Global Note"). The information included in Item 2.03 relating to the Registration Rights Agreement and the Global Note is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
 
Item 2.03.    Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On November 10, 2005, Marriott issued $427,231,000 in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes in exchange for $203,281,000 of its 7 percent Series E Notes due January 15, 2008 and $223,950,000 of its 7-7/8 percent Series C Notes due September 15, 2009. Marriott described the expiration of the exchange offers in the Current Report on Form 8-K that it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 8, 2005.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Global Note, the New Notes are general unsecured obligations of Marriott which bear interest at an annual rate of 5.81 percent, payable semi-annually on May 10 and November 10 of each year, beginning on May 10, 2006, and mature on November 10, 2015. Marriott may redeem the New Notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100 percent of the principal amount of the new notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date; and (ii) the su m of the present values of the principal amount of, and remaining scheduled payments of interest on, the notes to be redeemed (not including any interest accrued as of the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the global certificate representing the New Notes) plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
The terms of the New Notes are also governed by the Indenture dated November 16, 1998, between Marriott and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank. Information about the terms and conditions of the Indenture, including the material terms under which debt subject to the Indenture, including the New Notes, may be accelerated, is contained in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 that Marriott filed with the SEC on January 17, 2001, under the captions "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer-Certain Covenants," "Description of Debt Securities We M ay Offer-Defeasance" and "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer-Events of Default." Marriott incorporates that information by reference into this Item 2.03.
Marriott issued the New Notes in a private placement transaction and the New Notes are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with that issuance, Marriott and the dealer managers also entered into the Registration Rights Agreement. Under that agreement, Marriott agreed, among other things, to (i) file a registration statement with the SEC for an exchange offer in which Marriott would offer to exchange the New Notes for substantially identical notes that would be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Registered Exchange Offer"), and (ii) use its reasonable efforts to cause that registration statement to become effective. Marriott also agreed that under certain circumstances it would file a shelf registration statement with the SEC covering resales by holders of the New Notes in lieu of the Registered Exchang e Offer.
In the event that (each such event described below, a "Registration Default"): (i) Marriott does not file the registration statement for the Registered Exchange Offer on or before February 8, 2006; (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated or the shelf registration statement is not both filed and effective by October 6, 2006; or (iii) the shelf registration statement, if applicable, has been both filed and become effective but ceases to be effective or usable for a period of time that exceeds 90 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which it is required to be effective; then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of the New Notes affected by the Registration Default at a rate of 0.25 percent per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any Registration Default and shall increase to a maximum of 0.50 percent per annum additional interest thereafter while any Registration Default is continuing, until all Registration Defaults are cured.
The foregoing descriptions of the Global Note, Indenture, and Registration Rights Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Global Note, Indenture, and Registration Rights Agreement that are filed with or incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Report.

The Exchange Securities will be issued under the Indenture. Upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, within the agreed-upon time limits, the Company shall commence the Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Exchange Offer to enable each Holder eligible and electing to exchange Registrable Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder (a) is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, (b) is not a broker-dealer who tendered Old Notes acquired directly from the Company for its own account in exchange for New Notes, (c) acquired the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and (d) has no arrangements or understandings with any Person to participate in the Exchange Offer for the purpose of distributing the Exchange Securities) to transfer such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the 1933 Act and under state securities or blue sky laws.
Exchange Offer
In order to participate in the Exchange Offer, each Holder must represent to the Company at the time of the consummation of the Exchange Offer that it (i) is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, (ii) is not a broker-dealer who tendered Old Notes acquired directly from the Company for its own account in exchange for New Notes, (iii) acquired the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and (iv) has no arrangements or understandings with any Person to participate in the Exchange Offer for the purpose of distributing the Exchange Securities.
In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(a) mail as promptly as practicable to each Holder a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b) keep the Exchange Offer open for acceptance for a period of not less than 30 calendar days after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders (or longer at the option of the Company or if required by applicable law) (such period referred to herein as the "Exchange Period");
(c) utilize the services of the Depositary for the Exchange Offer;
(d) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Registrable Securities at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), on the last business day of the Exchange Period, by sending to the institution specified in the letter of transmittal or other applicable notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing such Holder's election to have such Securities exchanged;
(e) notify each Holder that any Registrable Security not tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest, but will not retain any rights under this Agreement (except in the case of the Dealer Managers and Participating Broker-Dealers as provided herein); and
(f) otherwise comply in all respects with all applicable laws relating to the Exchange Offer.
The Exchange Securities shall be issued under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical in all material respects to the Indenture and which, in either case, has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"), or is exempt from such qualification and shall provide that the Exchange Securities shall not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture or such indenture shall provide that the Exchange Securities and the New Notes shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange Securities or the New Notes will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter.
As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(i)
accept for exchange all Registrable Securities duly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the letter of transmittal which shall be an exhibit thereto;
(ii)
[reserved];
(iii)
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(iv)
cause the Trustee promptly to authenticate and deliver Exchange Securities to each Holder of Registrable Securities so accepted for exchange in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
Interest on each Exchange Security will accrue from the last date on which interest was paid on the Registrable Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Registrable Securities, from the date of original issuance. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than (i) that the Exchange Offer, or the making of any exchange by a Holder, does not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC, (ii) the due tendering of Registrable Securities in accordance with the Exchange Offer, (iii) that each Holder of Registrable Securities exchanged in the Exchange Offer shall have represented that it (A) is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, (B) is not a broker-dealer who tendered Old Notes acquired directly from the Company for its own account in exchange for New Notes, (C) acquired the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such H older's business and (D) has no arrangements or understandings with any Person to participate in the Exchange Offer for the purpose of distributing the Exchange Securities and shall have made such other representations as may be reasonably necessary under applicable SEC rules, regulations or interpretations to render the use of Form S-4 or other appropriate form under the 1933 Act available and (iv) that no action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by or before any governmental agency with respect to the Exchange Offer which, in the Company's judgment, would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Company to proceed with the Exchange Offer. The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the registrar for the Registrable Securities to furnish the Dealer Managers with the names and addresses of the Holders to whom the Exchange Offer is made, and the Dealer Managers shall have the right to contact such Holders and otherwise facil itate the tender of Registrable Securities in the Exchange Offer.
 
2.2 . (i) If, because of any changes in law, SEC rules or regulations or applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the SEC, the Company is not permitted to effect the Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 2.1 hereof, (ii) if for any other reason the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective within 225 days following the original issue of the Registrable Securities or the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 270 days after the original issue of the Registrable Securities, or (iii) if a Holder notifies the Company in writing prior to the 20th day following the consummation of the Exchange Offer that it is not permitted to participate in the Exchange Offer or does not receive fully tradeable Exchange Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer, then in case of each of clauses (i) through (iii) the Company shall, at its cost:
Shelf Registration
     (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 30 days after being required to do so under Section 2.2 hereof, file with the SEC, and thereafter shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective as promptly as practicable but no later than 270 days after the original issue of the Registrable Securities, a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the Majority Holders participating in the Shelf Registration and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement; , , that no Holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such Holder has signed and returned to the Company a notice and questionnaire as distributed by the Company consenting to such Holder's inclusion in the prospectus as a selling securityholder and providing such further information to the Company as the Company may reasonably request.
provided
however
     (b) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period of two years from the Closing Date, or for such shorter period that will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or cease to be outstanding or otherwise to be Registrable Securities (the "Effectiveness Period"); , that the Effectiveness Period in respect of the Shelf Registration Statement shall be extended to the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements under the 1933 Act and as otherwise provided herein.
provided, however
     (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, use its reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) any Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, at the time each such registration statement or amendment thereto becomes effective, and any Prospectus as of the date thereof forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any Prospectus forming part of any Shelf Registration Statement, and any supplement to such Prospectus (as amended or supplemented from time to time) (each, as of the date thereof), does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , that clauses (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph shall not apply to any information provided by the Dealer Managers or any Holder.
provided
         The Company further agrees, if necessary, to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, as required by Section 3(b) below, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC. In the event that the Exchange Offer is consummated within 270 days after the original issue of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall have no obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.2(ii).
2.3 . The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
Expenses
2.4. . An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC, and a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or has otherwise become effective under Rule 462 under the 1933 Act or any other applicable rule; , that if, after such Registration Statement has been declared effective or has otherwise become effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Registration Statement will be deemed not to have become effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Secur ities pursuant to such Registration Statement may legally resume.
Effectiveness
provided, however
2.5 . The Company agrees that in the event that (a) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the 90th calendar day following the date of original issue of the New Notes, (b) the Exchange Offer is neither consummated nor a Shelf Registration Statement has become effective on or prior to the 330th calendar day following the date of original issue of the New Notes, (c) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement required by this Agreement is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter cease to be effective (other than after such time as all New Notes have been disposed of hereunder) or is not usable prior to the consummation of the Exchange Offer or (d) the Shelf Registration Statement has been filed and is declared or otherwise becomes effective but ceases to be effective or usable for a period of time that exceeds 90 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which it is required to be effective h ereunder (each such event referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (d), a "Registration Default"), the interest rate borne by the New Notes affected thereby shall be increased ("Additional Interest") immediately upon occurrence of a Registration Default by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum with respect to the first 90-day period while one or more Registration Defaults is continuing and will increase to a maximum of one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum Additional Interest thereafter while one or more Registration Defaults is continuing until all Registration Defaults have been cured; that Additional Interest shall accrue only for those days that a Registration Default occurs and is continuing, including the date on which any Registration Default shall occur but not including the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. Such Additional Interest shall be calculated based on a year consisting of 360 days comprised of twelve 30-day month s. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults the accrual of Additional Interest will cease, the interest rate will revert to the original rate and, upon any subsequent Registration Default following any such cure of all Registration Defaults, Additional Interest will begin accruing again at one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum and will increase to a maximum of one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum as provided above until all Registration Defaults have been cured. Additional Interest shall not be payable with respect to Registration Defaults for any period during which a Shelf Registration Statement is effective and usable by the Holders.
Interest
provided
The Company shall notify the Trustee within three business days after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Additional Interest is required to be paid (an "Event Date"). Additional Interest shall be paid by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of Registrable Securities, on or before the applicable semiannual interest payment date, immediately available funds in sums sufficient to pay the Additional Interest then due. The Additional Interest due shall be payable on each interest payment date to the record Holder of New Notes affected thereby entitled to receive the interest payment to be paid on such date as set forth in the Indenture. Each obligation to pay Additional Interest shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the applicable Event Date.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no Additional Interest shall be payable in relation to the applicable Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Additional Interest is payable solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited or, if required by the rules and regulations under the 1933 Act, quarterly unaudited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared or otherwise become effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) for a period not to exceed an aggregate of 45 days in any calendar year, other material events or developments with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement su ch Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; , , that in no event shall the Company be required to disclose the business purpose for such suspension if the Company determines in good faith that such business purpose must remain confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to pay Additional Interest with respect to the New Notes to any Holder if the failure arises from the Company' failure to file, or cause to become effective, a Shelf Registration Statement within the time periods specified in this Section 2 by reason of the failure of such Holder to provide such information as (i) the Company may reasonably request, with reasonable prior written notice, for use in the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus included therein to the extent the Company reasonably determines that such information is required to be included therein by applicable law, (ii) the NASD or the Commission may request in connection with such Shelf Registration Statement or (iii) is required to comply with the agreements of such Holder as contained herein to the extent compliance thereof is necessary for the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared or otherwise become effective, including, without limitation, a signed notice and questionnaire as distributed by the Company consenting to such Holder's inclusion in the prospectus as a selling securityholder and providing such further information to the Company as the Company may reasonably request.

Indemnification; Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Dealer Manager, each Holder (including each Dealer Manager, if applicable, and each Participating Broker-Dealer), each Person who participates as an underwriter (any such Person being an "Underwriter") and each Person, if any, who controls any Dealer Manager, Holder or Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; , that (subject to Section 4(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
provided
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by any indemnified party), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Holder or Underwriter expressly for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
(b) Each Holder severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Dealer Managers, each Underwriter and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Dealer Managers, any Underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 4(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); , that no such Holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement.
provided, however
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit received by the indemnified party, on the one hand, and the indemnifying party, on the other hand, in connection with the Exchange Offer and the Shelf Registration and the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Dealer Managers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Dealer Managers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Holders or the Dealer Managers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Holders and the Dealer Managers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Dealer Managers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Dealer Manager shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the fees received by such Dealer Manager in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Dealer Manager Agreement.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls a Dealer Manager or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Dealer Managers or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Dealer Managers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the total amount of fees payable to each Dealer Manager pursuant to the Dealer Manager Agreement and not joint.
