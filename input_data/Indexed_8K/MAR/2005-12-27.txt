Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On October 21, 2005, the Company announced that director John W. Marriott III would leave his position as the Company's executive vice president - lodging in January 2006 and had accepted the position of Vice Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. On November 3, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the annual compensation of the non-employee Vice Chairman of the Board to be 125 percent of the annual cash retainer (disregarding committee Chair retainers), attendance fees and annual stock award of the non-employee directors. As Vice Chairman, Mr. Marriott will become entitled to such compensation after he is no longer an officer of the Company. A summary of the terms of the Company's director compensation, reflecting the foregoing amendment and other, immaterial changes approved earlier in the year, is set forth in Exhibit 10 to this Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Annual Cash Retainers are paid quarterly in cash and can be deferred or received in the form of Company stock units or stock options at the director's election under the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan or 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan. Attendance Fees are paid shortly after each meeting and can be deferred at the director's election.
Equity Compensation
Immediately before the annual meeting of shareholders each year, non-employee directors receive an annual award for a number of shares granted by the Board. Subject to the terms and limits in the 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, the market value of the awards will be $75,000 for the Vice Chairman and $60,000 for other non-employee directors.
Other Information
Non-employee directors' compensation is paid based on an annual period commencing with the annual shareholders meeting. The Company reimburses directors for travel expenses, other out-of-pocket costs they incur when they attend meetings and, for one meeting per year, attendance by spouses. To encourage our directors to visit and personally evaluate properties, the directors also receive complimentary rooms, food and beverages at Company-owned, operated or franchised hotels when on personal travel.
Officers of the Company are not paid for their service as directors.
