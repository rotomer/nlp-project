Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On February 6, 2006, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination for its Capped Convertible Preferred Stock and its ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the Company's state of incorporation, because no shares of either class of preferred stock are outstanding and the Company has no plans to issue such stock. A copy of the Certificate of Elimination is filed as Exhibit 3(i) to this Report.
The Certificate of Elimination has the effect of eliminating certificates of designation for the Capped Convertible Preferred Stock and the ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock from the Company's certificate of incorporation. The Company filed those now eliminated certificates of designation as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 16, 2000, and incorporated those certificates of designation by reference as Exhibits 3.4 and 3.5 to its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.
