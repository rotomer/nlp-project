statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as of its date or as of the date of such opinion, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that, in each case, such opinion need express no comment with respect to the financial statements and related schedules or other financial data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus).
In rendering such opinion, such signatory may (A) state that the opinion is limited to matters governed by the federal laws of the United States of America, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and such signatory may rely as to matters of New York law upon the opinion of DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, (B) rely as to matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries; that such signatory shall furnish copies thereof to the Representatives and state that they believe that the Underwriters and they are justified in relying upon such certificates, and (C) state that their opinions set forth in subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) above are subject to the qualification that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Securities may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
provided
(e) The Representatives shall have received from counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Delivery Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(g) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, dated the Delivery Date, of its chief financial and accounting officers stating that:
(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in Section 1 are true and correct as of the Delivery Date; the Company has complied with all its agreements contained herein; and the conditions set forth in Sections 6(a), 6(h) and 6(j) have been fulfilled; and
(ii) They have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and, in their opinion (A) as of its effective date
 
(or, if an Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company has been filed subsequent to the effective date thereof, as of the date of filing of the most recent such Annual Report on Form 10-K) the Registration Statement did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (B) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (C) the Prospectus does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(h) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained, since the date of the latest audited financial statements included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, any (i) loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or (ii) material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus) or any change or development which has had a Material Adverse Effect, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated herein or in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(i) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market shall have been suspended or minimum prices shall have been established on either of such exchanges or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal authorities, (iii) the United States shall have become engaged in hostilities, there shall have been an escalation in hostilities involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions (or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such) as to make it in each such case, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the several Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated herein or in the Prospectus.
(j) On the Delivery Date, unless otherwise provided in to the Terms Agreement, the Securities shall be rated at least Baa2 by Moody's and BBB+ by S&P, and the Company shall have delivered to the Representatives a letter or press release dated on or before the Delivery Date, from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that the Securities have such ratings; and since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred a downgrading in the rating assigned to the Securities or any of the Company's other

Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Securities), to which that Underwriter or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package (or any portion thereof) or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any controlling person of that Underwriter.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), each of its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage,
 
liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for such indemnified party to employ separate counsel or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable period of time, in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm or attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, if the indemnified parties under this Section 7 consist of any Underwriter or any of their respective controlling persons, or by the Company, if the indemnified parties under this Section consist of the Company or any of the Company's directors, officers or controlling persons. Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity agreements contained in Section 7(a) and 7(b), shall use its best efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of such action or claim. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss of liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

provided

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect
 
thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 7(c), in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under the Terms Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under the Terms Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Sections 1 and 4 shall survive the delivery of the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
8. If any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth in the Terms Agreement to be purchased by each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter set forth therein bears to the total principal amount of the Securities set forth therein; , , that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any Securities on the Delivery Date if the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.99% of the total principal amount of the Securities, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of Securities set forth in the Terms Agreement to be purchased by it. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives
Defaulting Underwriters.
provided
however
 
who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Securities. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the principal amount which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase, this Agreement and the Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 5 and 10.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
9. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of any payment for the Securities if, prior to that time, the events described in any of Section 6(h), 6(i) or 6(j) shall have occurred.
Effective Date and Termination.
10. If (a) the Company shall fail to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement or (b) the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement (including the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9), the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Securities, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
11. The Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement on behalf of the Representatives. Any notice by the Company to the Underwriters shall be sufficient if given in writing or by any standard form of telecommunication addressed to the Representatives at such address and time as may be specified in the Terms Agreement, and any notice by the Underwriters to the Company shall be sufficient if given in writing or by any standard form of telecommunication to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Treasurer (Dept. 52/924.11), with a copy to the same address, Attention: Law Department-Corporate Finance (Dept. 52/923.23).

12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and (B) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 7(b) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, officers of the Company and any person
