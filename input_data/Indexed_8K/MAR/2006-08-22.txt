Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
Effective August 16, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Marriott International, Inc. (the "Company"), upon recommendation of the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, amended the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated the Company's Bylaws, eliminating the Board's classified structure and adopting majority voting in director elections. On August 21, 2006 the Company filed a Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware which integrates the amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation.
The amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws which eliminate the classified Board structure were described in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2006. Those amendments were subsequently approved (upon recommendation of the Board) by the Company's shareholders at the Company's April 28, 2006 annual meeting of shareholders (the "Ann ual Meeting"). Pursuant to these amendments, directors elected at the 2005 and 2006 Annual Meetings have agreed to resign effective at the 2007 Annual Meeting. As a result, the entire Board will be voted on at the 2007 Annual Meeting.
Additional amendments to the Bylaws adopt majority voting in director elections, implementing a non-binding shareholder proposal which was also approved (upon recommendation of the Board) at the 2006 Annual Meeting. Specifically, the Bylaws were amended to add a new Section 3.4, which changes the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the nominee will be elected only if the number of shares voted "for" a nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. In contested elections, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast. In addition, if a nominee who already serves as director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. Within 90 days of the certification of election results, the Board will publicly disclose its decision regarding whether to accept or reject the resignation.
The Board also approved conforming changes to the Company's Governance Principles, which will be posted on the Company's Investor Relations website (http://www.marriott.com/investor).
This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are included as Exhibits 3.(i) and 3.(ii) to this filing and are incorporated in this Item 5.03 by reference.

(v) After such Interested Stockholder has become an Interested Stockholder, such Interested Stockholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a stockholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.

Nothing contained in this Article FIFTEENTH shall be construed to relieve any Interested Stockholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the corporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% or more of the voting power of all the shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or adopt any provisions inconsistent with or repeal this Article FIFTEENTH.

SIXTEENTH
Any amendment or repeal of this Article SIXTEENTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
If the Delaware General Corporation Law shall be amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then a director of the corporation, in addition to the circumstances in which such director is not liable immediately prior to such amendment, shall be free of liability to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 t imes the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share of the corporation or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Class A Common Stock, since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the corporation shall at any time after March 9, 1998 (the "Rights Dividend Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series& nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Particip ating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the corporation. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock in a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstandi ng immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the corporation.
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereto, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors.
(ii) During any default period, such voting rights of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless the holders of one-third in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Class A Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) Directors, and if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to such holder at their last address as the same appears on the books of the corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the ca lling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Class A Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until the successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of directors may (except as provided in paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this paragraph (C) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provide d in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Class A Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the corporation shall not
(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any share of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the corporation unless the corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.

Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by di viding (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph C below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Class A Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii) immediately above being referred to as the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Class A Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to one (1) with respect to such Preferred Stock and Class A Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Class A Common Stock.
(C) In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 7. In case the corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Class A Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common St ock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Ranking
Section 10. .

Amendment
Section 11. . Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share but no such fraction shall be less than one one-thousandth of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Section 6.2 All signatures which appear on the certificate may be facsimile including, without limitation, signatures of officers of the Corporation or the signatures of the stock transfer agent or registrar. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

Section 7.7 (a) Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding") (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged activity in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding; provided that, (i) except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors, and (ii) such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any actio n, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
(b) The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and onl y to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(c) To the extent that a director, officer or employee of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the reasonableness of any such expenses, a certification to such effect by any member of the Bar of the State of Delaware, which member of the Bar may have acted as counsel to any such director, officer or employee, shall be binding upon the Corporation unless the Corporation establishes that the certification was made in bad faith.
(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because any such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7. Such determination shall be made (i) by the board of directors, by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the shareholders.
(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer, director or employee of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer or employee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that any such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Section 7.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by a majority vote of those directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or, if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to such directors or counsel at the time such determination is made, such pers on acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Section 7.7 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
(g) The Corporation may but shall not be required to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this Section 7.7. The Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided herein.
(h) For purposes of this Section 7.7, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees, so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Section 7.7 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have had with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
(i) For purposes of this Section 7.7, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer or employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Section 7.7.
(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 7.7 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(k) This Section 7.7 shall be interpreted and construed to accord, as a matter of right, to any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, the full measure of indemnification and advancement of expenses permitted by Section 145 of the Business Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(l) Any costs incurred by any person in enforcing the provisions of this Section 7.7 shall be an indemnifiable expense in the same manner and to the same extent as other indemnifiable expenses under this Section 7.7.
(m) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 shall have the effect of or be construed to limit or adversely affect any claim or right to indemnification or advancement of expenses made by any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of this Corporation with respect to any state of facts which existed prior to the date of such amendment, modification or repeal, whether or not the Corporation has been notified of such claim, or such right has been asserted, prior to such date. Accordingly, any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to have prospective application only and shall not be applied retroactively.
Section 7.8 No shareholder shall have any right of inspecting any account, or book, or paper or document of this Corporation, except as conferred by law or by resolution of the shareholders or directors.
Section 7.9 The accounts, books, papers and documents of this Corporation shall be kept at the principal office of the Corporation in Montgomery County, Maryland or at such other place or places as may be required by law or designated by resolution of the shareholders or directors.
 
Section 8.1 Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any regular meeting of the shareholders (or at any special meeting thereof duly called for that purpose) by a majority vote of the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting; provided that in the notice of such special meeting notice of such purpose shall be given. Subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the board of directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present amend these Bylaws, or enact such other Bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation of the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, except that the final sentence of Section 3.2 and Section 14 of Article III and Articles VIII and IX of the Bylaws may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the v oting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
 
Section 9.1 Any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of shareholders of the Corporation may be called only by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire board of directors.
