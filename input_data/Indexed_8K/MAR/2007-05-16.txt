If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.
     
(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.08(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), and the applicable rate, if any, displayed on the relevant Screen or furnished by each Reference Bank, as the case may be, for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.08(a)(ii) and (iii).
     
(c) If prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any date on which an interest rate is to be determined pursuant to (a) the proviso to the definition of clause (a) of "Eurocurrency Rate" relating to LIBOR Loans, the Administrative Agent receives notice from two or more of the Reference Banks that deposits in the relevant Currency are not being offered by such Reference Bank or Banks to prime banks in the London interbank market for the applicable Interest Period or in the applicable amounts, (b) the proviso to the definition of clause (b) of "Eurocurrency Rate" relating to EURIBOR Loans, the Administrative Agent receives notice from two or more of the Reference Banks that deposits in the Euros are not being offered by such Reference Bank or Banks to prime banks in the European interbank market for the applicable Interest Period or in the applicable amounts or (c) the definition of "Sterling Swing Loan Rate", "Euro Swing Loan Rate" or "Swiss Franc Swing Loan Rate", the Administrative Agent receives notice from two or more of the Reference Banks that deposits in Sterling, Euros or Swiss Francs are not being offered by such Reference Bank or Banks for the applicable Interest Period or in the applicable amounts, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company of such circumstances, whereupon the right of the Company to select Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Rate Loans, as the case may be, in such Currency for any requested Revolving Loan Borrowing or Swing Rate Loan or any subsequent Revolving Loan Borrowing or Swing Rate Borrowing shall be suspended until the first date on which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender whose Termination Date falls prior to the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (a "
Relevant Lender
") shall participate in such Loan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Relevant Lender shall (i) participate in a Borrowing of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan having an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender's Termination Date, (ii) have any outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan continued for a subsequent Interest Period if
such subsequent Interest Period would end after such Lender's Termination Date or (iii) have any outstanding Base Rate Loan Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan if such Eurocurrency Rate Loan would have an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender's Termination Date. If any Relevant Lender has outstanding a Eurocurrency Rate Loan that cannot be continued for a subsequent Interest Period pursuant to clause (ii) above or has outstanding a Base Rate Loan that cannot be Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Lender's ratable share of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (ii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the last day of its then current Interest Period and such Lender's ratable share of such Base Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (iii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the day on which the Loans of Lenders unaffected by said clause (iii) are so Converted.

(a) The Borrowers shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Revolving Loan or Swing Loan other than as provided in subsection (b) below. Unless otherwise agreed by the relevant Lender in its sole discretion, no Borrower shall have the right to prepay any principal amount of any Competitive Bid Loan of such Lender except on the terms specified by the Company for such Competitive Bid Loan in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Loan Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 3.02 and set forth in the Competitive Bid Loan Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Loan.

(New York City time) on the date of prepayment of any Swing Loan denominated in Dollars, or (iii) upon notice by no later than 11:00 AM (London time) one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of any Swing Loan denominated in Sterling, Euros or Swiss Francs, in any case given to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Loans made to such Borrower comprising part of the same Revolving Loan Borrowing or Swing Loan Borrowing, as the case may be, in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided
,
however
, that (x) each partial prepayment (other than any prepayment of any Swing Loan) shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Foreign Currency Equivalent of such respective amounts in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency) and (y) if any prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans (or on a date which is not the maturity date of such Swing Loans), such Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing to each Lender pursuant to Section 9.04(c) so long as such Lender makes written demand upon such Borrower therefor (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) within 20 Business Days after such prepayment.
     
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, if so requested in writing by the Required Lenders through the Administrative Agent within sixty (60) days after the
Company notifies the Administrative Agent of the occurrence of such Change of Control, (i) the Company shall, on a day not later than five Business Days after the date of such request, prepay and/or cause to be prepaid the full principal of and interest on the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever payable under this Agreement (including without limitation amounts payable under Section 9.04(c) as a result of such prepayment) and provide cash collateral for all outstanding Letters of Credit as provided in Section 7.02 (as if an Event of Default had occurred and was continuing) and (ii) the Commitments shall, on the date of such request, forthwith terminate.
     
(d) If (i) the obligations of the Company under Article X with respect to any outstanding Guaranteed Obligations owing by any Designated Borrower (herein, the "
Affected
Borrower
") shall for any reason (x) be terminated, (y) cease to be in full force and effect or (z) not be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, and (ii) such condition continues unremedied for 15 days after written notice thereof shall have been given to the Company by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, then the Affected Borrower shall, no later than the 15th day after the date of such notice, prepay (and the Company shall cause to be prepaid) the full principal of and interest on the Loans owing by, and the Notes payable by, such Affected Borrower and all other amounts whatsoever payable hereunder by such Affected Borrower (including, without limitation, all amounts payable under Section 9.04(c) as a result of such prepayment).
SECTION 2.11
Payments and Computations
.
     
(a) All payments of principal of and interest on each Loan in a particular Currency shall be made in such Currency.
     
(b) (i) All payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts whatsoever payable by a Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made in immediately available funds, without deduction, setoff or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent's Account for the relevant Currency, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) (in the case of amounts payable in Dollars) or 11:00 A.M. Local Time in the location of the Administrative Agent's Account (in the case of amounts payable in an Alternate Currency), on the day when due,
provided
that if a new Loan is to be made by any Lender to any Borrower on a date on which such Borrower is to repay any principal of an outstanding Loan of such Lender in the same Currency, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of such new Loan to the payment of the principal to be repaid and only an amount equal to the difference between the principal to be borrowed and the principal to be repaid shall be made available by such Lender to the Administrative Agent as provided in Article III or paid by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.11, as the case may be.
     
(c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (other than if the Base Rate is computed on the basis of the Federal Funds Rate) or the Sterling Swing Loan Rate and of facility fees and letter of credit commission shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Euro Swing Loan Rate, the Swiss Franc Swing Loan Rate or the Base Rate based on the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, and all computations of utilization fees shall be as specified in Section 2.05(d), in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
     
(d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, facility fee, letter of credit commission or utilization fee, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
     
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each relevant Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
     
(f) Anything in Sections 2.07 or 2.08 to the contrary notwithstanding, and without prejudice to Sections 2.08(b) or 7.01(a), if any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal or interest denominated in an Alternate Currency within one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of principal and three Business Days after the due date therefor in the case of interest (without giving effect to any acceleration of maturity under Article VII), the amount so in default shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the day one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of a principal payment and three Business Days after the due date
therefor in the case of an interest payment in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such principal or interest.
     
(a) Any and all payments by each Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding
, in the case of each Lender (which for all purposes of this Section 2.12 shall include each Issuing Bank) and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (including alternative minimum taxable income), and franchise taxes imposed on it, by any jurisdiction under the laws of which such Person is organized or in which such Person is resident or doing business, or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Notes to any such Person, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Person receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
     
(b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
").
     
(c) Each Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) paid in good faith by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including, without limitation, penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted;
provided
,
however
, that (i) no Borrower shall be liable to any Person, as the case may be, for any liability arising from or with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes, which results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, (ii) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each Borrower in contesting any Taxes or Other Taxes which such Borrower reasonably deems to be not correctly or legally asserted or otherwise not due and owing and (iii) no Borrower shall be liable to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for any such liability arising prior to the date 120 days prior to the date on which such Person first makes written demand upon such Borrower for indemnification therefor. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
     
(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by a Borrower, such Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
     
(e) (i) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank and on the date of the Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event within the control of such Lender (including a change in Applicable Lending Office but not including a change in law) requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company (but only so long thereafter as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Company with either Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying in the case of form W-8BEN that such Lender is either (i) entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party that reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments under this Agreement or (ii) a Portfolio Interest Eligible Non-Bank (as defined below) or certifying in the case of form W-8ECI that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero (or if such Lender cannot provide at such time such form because it is not entitled to reduced withholding under a treaty and the payments are not effectively connected income), withholding tax at such rate (or at the then existing U.S. statutory rate if the Lender cannot provide such a form) shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" as defined in Section 2.12(a) unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate form certifying that a zero rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such zero rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form;
provided
,
however
, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.07(h) and was entitled to payments under Section 2.12(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term "
Taxes
" shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States interest withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this Section 2.12(e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the relevant Lender considers to be confidential, such Lender shall give notice thereof to the Company and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. For purposes of this paragraph (e) the term "
Portfolio Interest Eligible Non-Bank
" means a Lender that certifies in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower that (i) it is not a bank within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(A), (ii) it is not a 10% shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(B) and (iii) it is not a controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(C).
     
(f) For any period with respect to which a Person that is required pursuant to Section 2.12(e) to provide a Borrower with any documentation described therein but has failed to provide a Borrower with such documentation or notice that it cannot provide such form or other documentation (
other than
if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form or other documentation originally was required to be provided, or if such form or other documentation otherwise is not required under the first sentence of subsection (e) above), such Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.12(a) with respect to Taxes;
provided
,
however
, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form or other documentation required hereunder, the relevant Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.
     
(g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
     
(h) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement, in the event that a Lender that originally provided such form or other documentation as may be required under Section 2.12(e) thereafter ceases to qualify for complete exemption from withholding tax, such Lender may assign its interest under this Agreement to any Eligible Assignee and such assignee shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Section 2.12 as the assignor provided that the rate of withholding tax applicable to such assignee shall not exceed the rate then applicable to the assignor.
     
(i) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 2.12 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes and the termination of the Commitments.
(j) If a Borrower is required to pay any Lender any Taxes under
Section 2.12(c), such Lender shall be an "
Affected Person
", and the Company shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person.
     
SECTION 2.13
Sharing of Payments, Etc.
If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.09(d), 2.12, 2.15(c), 3.05, 3.08 or 9.04(c)) in excess
of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans obtained by all such Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them,
provided
,
however
, that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
     
(a)
Optional
. Each Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on (x) the third (or the fourth, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency) Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion into Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) the first Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion into Base Rate Loans, and, in each case, subject to the provisions of Section 3.05, Convert all or any portion of the Revolving Loans of one Type in the same Currency comprising the same Revolving Loan Borrowing into Revolving Loans of the other Type in the same Currency;
provided
,
however
, that any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and any Conversion of Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 3.01(b). Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Revolving Loans to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the duration of the initial Interest Period for such Revolving Loans. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers.
     
(b)
Mandatory
. If the Company shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loans in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon each such Eurocurrency Rate Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan.
     
(c)
Conversions Generally
. Each Borrower and the Lenders hereby acknowledge that Conversions pursuant to this Section 2.14 do not constitute Borrowings and, accordingly, do not result in the remaking of any of the Company's representations and warranties pursuant to Section 4.02 or Section 4.03.
SECTION 2.15
Extension of Termination Date
.
     
(a) The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not less than 45 days and not more than 90 days prior to each of the

provided
,
further
, that when determining a Swiss Franc/Sterling Lender's ratable portion of any Borrowing, the Swiss Franc Outstandings and the Sterling Outstandings of such Swiss Franc/Sterling Lender are deducted from the amount such Swiss Franc/Sterling Lender would otherwise make available, until each other Lender's portion of such Borrowing is equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Swiss Franc Outstandings and the Sterling Outstandings of any Swiss Franc/Sterling Lender and all Revolving Loan Borrowings denominated in Swiss Francs or Sterling will be ratably funded by the Swiss Franc/Sterling Lenders only.

provided

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time any Revolving Loan Borrowing is required to be made that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 3.01 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Loans comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate,

If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
     
(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by it as part of any Revolving Loan Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Loan on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Loan Borrowing.

provided
that the failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any Competitive Bid Loan as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Loan Borrowing.

prima facie
evidence of such costs.

(f) Upon the permanent reduction from time to time of the aggregate Available
Amount of all Letters of Credit in accordance with the terms thereof, the Administrative Agent
shall release to the Company amounts from the L/C Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to each such permanent reduction;
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to reduce the funds or other L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral then held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account below that level that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines is required to be maintained after taking into consideration any rights or claims of any Persons other than the Administrative Agent.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.07 except for the conditions
set forth in clause (iii) of this Section 9.07(a), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any Eligible Assignee (consented to by the Company and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

By executing and delivering a New Commitment Acceptance, the New Lender thereunder confirms to and agrees with the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such New Lender hereby agrees that no Lender has made any representation or warranty, or assumes any responsibility with respect to, (x) any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or (y) the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance and each New Commitment Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent shall provide the Company with a copy of the Register upon request.
     
(e) (i) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Revolving Loan Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto, (1) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (2) record the information contained therein in the Register and (3) give prompt notice thereof to the Company. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Revolving Loan Note or Notes a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitments assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitments retained by it hereunder. Such new Revolving Loan Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Revolving Loan Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-l hereto. Such surrendered Revolving Loan Note or Notes shall be marked "canceled" and shall be returned promptly to the Company.
     
(f) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, a portion of its Commitments, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it);
provided
,
however
, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) except in the case of a participation involving a Lender and one of its Affiliates (and this exception shall apply only so long as the participant remains an Affiliate of such Lender), the parties to each such participation shall execute a participation agreement in substantially the form of the Participation Agreement, and (vi) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment to or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would alter the principal of, or interest on, the Loan or Loans in which such participant is participating or any fees or other amounts payable to the Lenders hereunder, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender shall provide the Company with a list of entities party to all Participation Agreements with such Lender upon request.
     
(g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information, including Confidential Information, relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrowers;
provided
that, prior to any such disclosure of Confidential Information, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and shall agree to (i) preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrowers received by it from such Lender and (ii) be bound by the provisions of Section 9.11.
     
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 9.07, no Lender may assign its interest to an Eligible Assignee if, as of the effective date of such assignment, such assignment would increase the amount of Taxes, Other Taxes or increased costs payable under Sections 2.12 or 3.05, respectively.
     
(i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time and without the consent of the Administrative Agent or any Borrower

except
that each Borrower shall have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by such Borrower that were caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank acting in good faith may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

(a) Each of the parties hereto (and each Designated Borrower, by its acceptance of the proceeds of Loans made to it) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto and each Designated Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto and each Designated Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in the courts of any jurisdiction.
     
(b) Each of the parties hereto and each Designated Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court.

EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH ISSUING BANK AND EACH OF THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE LOANS, THE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
     
SECTION 9.14
Judgment Currency
. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or an Alternate Currency, as the case may be (the "
Specified
Currency
"), any payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the "
Specified Place
"), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the "
Second Currency
"), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (an "
Entitled Person
") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and each Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.
     
(a)
Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally
. With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in Euro, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any of the Borrowers, any of the Multicurrency Swing Loan Banks or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds (in Euro) to the account of any Borrower, any Swing Loan Bank or any Lender in the Principal Financial Center in the Participating Member State which such Borrower, such Swing Loan Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have specified for such purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, "
all relevant steps
" means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing or settling payments in Euro.
     
(b)
Other Consequential Changes
. Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrowers to the Lenders and the Multicurrency Swing Loan Banks and the Lenders and the Multicurrency Swing Loan Banks to the Borrowers under or pursuant to this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction of or changeover to Euros in Participating Member States.
     
SECTION 9.16

SECTION 9.17
Original Notes
. Contemporaneously with the receipt by each Lender of a Revolving Loan Note on the Effective Date, the Original Note held by such Lender shall be deemed to be cancelled and amended and restated by such Revolving Loan Note (regardless of whether such Lender shall have delivered to the Company for cancellation the Original Note held by it). Each Lender shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Original Note held by it to the Company in connection with the foregoing cancellation and amendment and restatement. All amounts owing under, and evidenced by, the Original Notes as of the Effective Date shall continue to be outstanding under, and shall and from the Effective Date be evidenced by the Revolving Loan Notes, and shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, actions or claims that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Company arising out of such Lender's failure to deliver the Original Note held by it to the Company for cancellation, subject to the condition that the Company shall not make any payment to any Person claiming to be the holder of such Original Note unless such Lender is first notified of such claim and is given the opportunity, at such Lender's sole cost and expense, to assert any defenses to such payment.
     
SECTION 9.18

The Company hereby further agrees that if any Designated Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by optional prepayment or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Company will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
irrevocable irrespective of (i) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) any modification, amendment or variation in or addition to the terms of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any covenants in respect thereof or any security therefor, (iii) any extension of time for performance or waiver of performance of any covenant of any Designated Borrower or any failure or omission to enforce any right with regard to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, (iv) any exchange, surrender, release of any other guaranty of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (v) any other circumstance with regard to any of the Guaranteed Obligations which may or might in any manner constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent hereof that the obligations of the Company hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
     
(b) The Company hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest, and all notices whatsoever with regard to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Designated Borrower hereunder or under the Designation Letter of such Designated Borrower or any Note of such Designated Borrower or any other guarantor of or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

SECTION 10.05
Remedies
. The Company agrees that, as between the Company on the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand, the obligations of any Designated Borrower guaranteed under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable, or may be deemed automatically to have been accelerated, as provided in Article VII, for purposes of Section 10.01 hereof notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition (whether in a bankruptcy proceeding affecting such Designated Borrower or otherwise) preventing such declaration as against such Designated Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration or automatic acceleration such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Designated Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes of said Section 10.01.
