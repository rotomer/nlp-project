Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
For analytical purposes, Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott") today is furnishing a schedule of cost reimbursements revenue for the last four fiscal years allocated by segment. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where Marriott and its subsidiaries are the employer. This revenue and related expense has no impact on either Marriott's operating income or net income because we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred, with no added markup. The schedule of segment detail is attached as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference.
