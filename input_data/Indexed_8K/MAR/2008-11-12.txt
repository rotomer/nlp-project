Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On November 6, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Marriott International, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to the Marriott International, Inc. Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") and the Marriott International, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDC") that provide covered executive officers, including the Company's named executive officers, certain "double trigger" severance benefits if a covered executive's employment is terminated in connection with a change in control. In each case, no such benefits are provided to the extent it would result in the loss of a deduction or imposition of excise taxes under the excess parachute payment provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, the amendments provide that if a covered executive's employment is terminated involuntarily (other than for misconduct) during the period beginning three months before or ending 12 months following a change in control of the Company, the executive's unvested equity awards u nder the Incentive Plan and the executive's unvested EDC balances will immediately vest. In those circumstances, the executive's stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) will be exercisable until the earlier of the original expiration date of the awards or 12 months following the executive's termination of employment (or five years if the executive terminates while eligible for retirement), and all other stock awards will be distributed immediately following the later of the termination of employment or the change in control event. In addition, any cash incentive awards under the Incentive Plan will be paid immediately based on the target performance level and pro-rated based on the days worked during the year until the executive's termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments and distributions will be delayed, to the extent necessary, to avoid the imposition of excise taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
 
Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On November 6, 2008, the Board of the Company, upon recommendation of the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, amended and restated the Company's Bylaws, effective immediately. The Bylaw amendments revise provisions relating to the location, date and time of shareholders' meetings, the standard for electing directors and advance notice of shareholder business to be presented at annual shareholders' meetings.   
Location, Date and Time of Shareholders' Meetings
The amendments to the Bylaws revise the provisions relating to the location, date and time of shareholders' meetings to provide that the Board shall from time to time designate the location, date and time of shareholders' meetings. (Section 2.1, Section 2.2)
Director Election Standard
The amendments to the Bylaws include adding a deadline for determining whether an election of directors is contested. In a contested election, a plurality, rather than a majority, voting standard will apply. Under the Amended a nd Restated Bylaws, the date is five days before the Company files its proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, language regarding a director who did not receive a majority vote offering to tender his or her resignation and the description of the process for Board consideration of such offer has been removed from the Bylaws. The related provisions of the Company's Governance Principles will be revised to reflect the language deleted from the Bylaws. (Section 3.4)
Advance Notice of Shareholder Business
The amendments to the Bylaws relating to the advance notice provisions revise the time frame for shareholders to give notice to the Company of their intent to propose business at an annual shareholders' meeting. Under the revised time frame, shareholders must give notice no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and no later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders. As a result of the Bylaw amendments, if any shareholder intends to present business (not including a proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholder's notice must be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on January 2, 2009, and not later than the close of business on February 1, 2009. (Section 2.10(b))
In addition, to be considered, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received by the Company no later than 5:00 p.m. (the close of business) on November 28, 2008 and must satisfy the other requirements of Rule 14a-8.
The Bylaws also were amended to update the information that must be included in a notice submitted by a shareholder that intends to present business at an annual shareholders' meeting. Among other things, the amendments require a shareholder to provide information, as of the date of the notice and the record date for the meeting, about any agreement, arrangement or understanding that has the effect or intent of mitigating loss, managing risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class or series of shares of the Company, or increasing or decreasing voting power with respect to shares of the Company, including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares, and about any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of shares of the Company. In addition, the shareholder must provide the Company with a written update of certain of the information requir ed to be included in the notice within five business days after the record date of the meeting. (Section 2.10(c))
Other Changes
The remaining amendments to the Bylaws were immaterial language changes and clarifying or conforming changes.
This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are included as Exhibit 3.(i) to this filing and are incorporated in this Item 5.03 by reference.

Section 3.1 Except as otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of the directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the board of directors but shall not be less than three. The directors, elected at any annual meeting of shareholders prior to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2007, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, as determined by the board of directors of the Corporation, one class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 1998, another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 1999, and another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2000, with each class to hold office until its successor is elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation, prior to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2007, the successors of
5
the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election. At each annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation from and after the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2007, each director standing for election, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders, with such director to hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Advance notice of shareholder nominations for the election of directors shall be given in the manner provided in Section 3.13 of Article III of these Bylaws.
     
Section 3.2 Except as otherwise provided for or fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the board of directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders, with such director to hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office, with or without cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
     
Section 3.3 The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its board of directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
     
Section 3.4 In the election of directors at a meeting of the shareholders at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; provided, that if, as of a date that is five (5) business days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors, not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the board of directors in accordance with the Bylaws, receiving the greatest number of votes of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, present in person or by proxy, shall be the directors for the term as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee exceeds the number of shares voted "against" that nominee. If, for any cause, the board of directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected thereafter at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.
Meetings of the Board of Directors
Section 3.5 The board of directors of the Corporation may hold meetings, both
regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.
     
Section 3.6 The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the shareholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the shareholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the shareholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.

Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone or telegram not less than twenty-four (24) hours notice before the date of the meeting, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.
     
Section 3.9 At all meetings of the board of directors such number of directors as shall be not less than one-third of the total number of the full board of directors nor less than two shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board of directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
     
Section 3.10 Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
     
Section 3.11 The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided, in the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another
7
member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors. At all meetings of committees of the board of directors, such number of members shall be not less than one-half of the total number of the full committee nor less than two shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the members present at any committee meeting as which there is a quorum shall be the act of the committee, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors when required.
     
Section 3.12 The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefore. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
     
Section 3.13 Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the board of directors or a proxy committee appointed by the board of directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors.
However, any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors at a meeting may nominate a director only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not later than (i) with respect to an election of directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty days or delayed by more than sixty days from such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which notice of such meeting is first given to shareholders, and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to shareholders.

The chairman of the meeting may refuse to
8

11
represented by uncertificated shares. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors of the Corporation, every holder of stock represented by a certificate and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or a vice president, and by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer of the Corporation, representing the number of shares owned by him or her in the Corporation registered in certificated form. All certificates shall also be signed by a transfer agent and by a registrar. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical.
     
Section 6.2 All signatures which appear on the certificate may be facsimile including, without limitation, signatures of officers of the Corporation or the signatures of the stock transfer agent or registrar. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.
     
Section 6.3 If the Corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge, to each shareholder who so requests, the designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
     
Section 6.4 The board of directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

her attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation or its agents may reasonably require. Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated shares such uncertificated shares shall be canceled and issuance of new equivalent uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the person entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded upon the books of the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send or cause to be sent to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to Delaware Law or, unless otherwise provided by Delaware Law, a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each shareholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
     
Section 6.7 The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
     
Section 7.1 Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
     
Section 7.2 Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to
13
time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
     
Section 7.3 The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting and at any special meeting of the shareholders when called for by vote of the shareholders a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the Corporation.

Section 7.7 (a) Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding") (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged activity in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding; provided that, (i) except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors,
14
and (ii) such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
     
(b) The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
     
(c) To the extent that a director, officer or employee of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the reasonableness of any such expenses, a certification to such effect by any member of the Bar of the State of Delaware, which member of the Bar may have acted as counsel to any such director, officer or employee, shall be binding upon the Corporation unless the Corporation establishes that the certification was made in bad faith.
     
(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because any such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7. Such determination shall be made (i) by the board of directors, by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the shareholders.
     
(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer, director or employee of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer or employee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that any such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Section 7.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by a majority vote of those directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or, if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to such directors or counsel at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
     
(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Section 7.7 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
     
(g) The Corporation may but shall not be required to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this Section 7.7. The Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided herein.
     
(h) For purposes of this Section 7.7, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees, so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Section 7.7 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have had with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
     
(i) For purposes of this Section 7.7, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer or employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Section 7.7.
     
(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 7.7 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
     
(k) This Section 7.7 shall be interpreted and construed to accord, as a matter of right, to any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, the full measure of indemnification and advancement of expenses permitted by Section 145 of the Business Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     
(l) Any costs incurred by any person in enforcing the provisions of this Section 7.7 shall be an indemnifiable expense in the same manner and to the same extent as other indemnifiable expenses under this Section 7.7.
     
(m) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 shall have the effect of or be construed to limit or adversely affect any claim or right to indemnification or advancement of expenses made by any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of this Corporation with respect to any state of facts which existed prior to the date of such amendment, modification or repeal, whether or not the Corporation has been notified of such claim, or such right has been asserted, prior to such date. Accordingly, any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to have prospective application only and shall not be applied retroactively.
     
Section 7.8 No shareholder shall have any right of inspecting any account, or book, or paper or document of this Corporation, except as conferred by law or by resolution of the shareholders or directors.
     
Section 7.9 The accounts, books, papers and documents of this Corporation shall be kept at the principal office of the Corporation in Montgomery County, Maryland or at such other place or places as may be required by law or designated by resolution of the shareholders or directors.
     
Section 8.1 Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any regular meeting of the shareholders (or at any special meeting thereof duly called for that purpose) by a majority vote of the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting; provided that in the notice of such special meeting notice of such purpose shall be given. Subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the board of directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present amend these Bylaws, or enact such other Bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation of the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, except that the final sentence of Section 3.2 and Section 3.13 of Article III and Articles VIII and IX of the Bylaws may be amended only by the affirmative vote
17
of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
     
Section 9.1 Any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of shareholders of the Corporation may be called only by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire board of directors.

shareholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage
risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class or series of the Corporation's
capital stock, or increase or decrease the voting power of the shareholder or beneficial
owner with respect to shares of capital stock of the Corporation, including the notional
number of shares that are the subject of such agreement, arrangement or understanding,
and (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in
writing) between or among such shareholder or beneficial owner and any other person
relating to acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of stock of the
Corporation, including the number of shares that are the subject of such agreement,
arrangement or understanding;
     
(iv) as to the shareholder giving the notice or, if the notice is given on
behalf of a beneficial owner on whose behalf the business is being proposed, as to such
beneficial owner, a representation that the shareholder will notify the Corporation in
writing within five (5) business days after the record date for such meeting as to the status
of each of the matters set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (iii) as of the
record date for the meeting;
     
(v) a representation as to whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner

form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital
stock required to approve or adopt the business to be proposed (in person or by proxy) by
the shareholder; and
     
(vi) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if

owner's written consent to the public disclosure of information provided pursuant to this
Section 2.10.
     
(d) The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.10 shall not apply to a
shareholder if the shareholder has only notified the Corporation of his or her intention to
present a shareholder proposal at an annual meeting pursuant to and in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and such proposal has been included in a proxy
statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual
meeting.
     
(e) Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of shareholders
as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 2.10 (other than nominations for the election of directors, which are
governed by Section 3.13 of these Bylaws). The chairman of the board of directors or the
secretary may, if the facts warrant, determine that a notice received by the Corporation
relating to an item of business proposed to be introduced at an annual meeting of
shareholders does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.10 (including if the
shareholder does not provide the information required under clauses (c)(ii)(B), (c)(iii) and
(c)(iv) of this Section 2.10 to the Corporation within five (5) business days after the record
date for the meeting), and if it be so determined, shall so declare and any such business
shall not be introduced at such meeting of shareholders, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such matters may have been received. If the chairman of a meeting of
shareholders determines that business raised at the meeting was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such
business shall not be transacted notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such business
may have been received. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10, if
the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) is not present at the
annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to propose such business, such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such
vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.10, to be
considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be a duly
authorized officer, manager or partner of such shareholder or authorized by a writing
executed by such shareholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the
writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the making of such proposal at such meeting
by such shareholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such shareholder as
proxy at the meeting of shareholders.
(f) For purposes of this Section 2.10, a "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in
a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable
national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. For
purposes of clause (c)(iii)(A) of this Section 2.10, the term "associate" shall have the
meaning set forth in Rule 14a-1(a) under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Section
2.10, shares shall be treated as "beneficially owned" by a person if the person beneficially
owns such shares, directly or indirectly, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and Regulations 13D and 13G thereunder or has or shares pursuant to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing) (i) the right to acquire such
shares (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or
the fulfillment of a condition or both), (ii) the right to vote such shares, alone or in concert
with others, and/or (iii) investment power with respect to such shares, including the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, such shares, and any such person shall be
treated as the "beneficial owner" of such shares.
6
number of directors and any vacancies on the board of directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders, with such director to hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office, with or without cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
     
Section 3.3 The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its board of directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.
     
Section 3.4 In the election of directors at a meeting of the shareholders at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; provided, that if
, as of a date that is five (5) business
days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement
(regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission,
the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors, not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the board of directors in accordance with the Bylaws, receiving the greatest number of votes of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, present in person or by proxy, shall be the directors for the term as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee exceeds the number of shares voted "against" that nominee.
^
If, for any cause, the board of directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected thereafter at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.

7
be present. In the event of the failure of the shareholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the shareholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
     
Section 3.7 Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.

Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone or telegram not less than twenty-four (24) hours notice before the date of the meeting, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.
     
Section 3.9 At all meetings of the board of directors such number of directors as shall be not less than one-third of the total number of the full board of directors nor less than two shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board of directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
     
Section 3.10 Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
     
Section 3.11 The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided, in the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he
, she
or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting

Section 7.7 (a) Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding") (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged activity in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding; provided that, (i) except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors, and (ii) such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
16
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
     
(b) The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(c) To the extent that a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the reasonableness of any such expenses, a certification to such effect by any member of the Bar of the State of Delaware, which member of the Bar may have acted as counsel to any such director, officer or employee, shall be binding upon the Corporation unless the Corporation establishes that the certification was made in bad faith.
     
(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer or employee is proper in the circumstances because any such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.7. Such determination shall be made (i) by the board of directors, by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the shareholders.
     
(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer, director or employee of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer or employee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that any such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Section 7.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by a majority vote of those directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or, if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to such directors or counsel at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe his
or her
conduct was unlawful.
     
(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Section 7.7 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.

15.4
Section 280G Cut-back in Benefits.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, in the event that the amount of payments or other benefits payable to any Participant under this Plan, together with any payments or benefits payable under any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement maintained by the Company or one of its affiliates, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G or the Code), the payments under this Plan shall be reduced in a manner determined by the Company (by the minimum possible amounts) until no amount payable to the Participant under the Plan constitutes an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). All determinations required to be made under this Section 15.4, including whether a payment would result in an "excess parachute payment" and the assumptions utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a registered public accounting firm selected by the Company.
- 25 -

. No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan or any Award shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award.

.

18.1 Tax Withholding
. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct from any amount otherwise due to the Participant, or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, and local income, employment or other related taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan.
     
18.2 Share Withholding
. With respect to withholding required in connection with any Award, the Company may require, or the Committee may permit a Participant to elect, that the withholding requirement be satisfied, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory total tax which could be withheld on the transaction. Any election by a Participant shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
     
Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf.

All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, or a merger, consolidation or otherwise.

(e)
Forfeiture for Failure to Comply with Non-Competition Requirements.
All vesting on Company Accruals is subject to a Participant's compliance with the Company's Non-Competition Agreement. A Participant shall be deemed to comply with the Non-Competition Agreement if such Participant does not engage in activities in Competition with the business of the Company. "Competition" shall mean (i) engaging, individually or as an employee, consultant, owner (more than five percent (5%)) or agent of any entity, in or on behalf of any business engaged in significant competition (or that transacts or cooperates with another business in activities of significant competition) with any business operated by the Company or with interests adverse to those of the Company; (ii) soliciting and hiring a key employee of the Company in another business, whether or not in significant competition with any business operated by the Company; or (iii) using or disclosing confidential or proprietary Company information, in each case, without the approval of the Company. Determination of whether or not particular activities are in competition will be made by the Company in its reasonable judgment.
     
The non-Vested Portion of a Participant's Account shall be forfeited upon the Participant's Separation from Service or if a Participant is found to have engaged in Competition with the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant who has incurred a Separation from Service is Reinstated within ninety (90) days of the Separation date, such Participant's forfeited Account balance shall be reinstated in the Plan with his original service history and shall continue to vest in his Account.
At the time a Participant makes an Election for the amount to be deferred for an
Election Year in accordance with Section 3.2, such Participant may elect that a specified
- 10 -
percentage of the Deferred Compensation be credited with hypothetical earnings in accordance with the performance of designated funds selected by the Company or its delegate ("Benchmark Funds"), as described in Appendix A. The Company shall credit such earnings to the Deferred Compensation Reserve on a daily basis. If a Participant does not make an allocation election, the Participant's account will be credited with the rate of return on the money market fund included in the Benchmark Funds. Once a Participant has allocated amounts in the Participant's Account to Benchmark Funds, the Participant may elect to change the allocation of all or a portion of his Account among the Benchmark Funds on a periodic basis in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing of this Section 3.5, the hypothetical earnings credited to a Participant's or beneficiary's Account may be adjusted in accordance with Section 5.2. A Reinstated Participant whose forfeited Account balance is reinstated in accordance with Section 3.4 shall not be credited with earnings after the date of his original Separation from Service and before the date the Account balance is reinstated.
thereunder on behalf of each Participant are for administrative purposes only, and do not vest in the Participants any right, title or interest in such reserve or such accounts, except as expressly set forth in this Plan.
     
(b) Title to and beneficial ownership of any assets, whether cash or investments which the Company may designate to make payments of Deferred Compensation hereunder, shall at all times remain in the Company, and no Participant shall have any property interest whatsoever in any specific assets of the Company.
     
The rights of Participants or any other persons to the payment of amounts from the Deferred Compensation Reserve under this Plan shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
     
Federal and state payroll taxes or state, local or foreign income taxes required to be withheld on Deferred Compensation credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Reserve shall be withheld from other Compensation paid to the Participant at the time of deferral. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Participant's other Compensation is insufficient to pay such amounts, the amount of Deferred Compensation credited to the Deferred Compensation Reserve on the Participant's account shall be reduced, at the time amounts are to be credited, to the extent necessary to cover all required withholding taxes.
- 11 -
in accordance with Section 2.3 whether distribution of amounts credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Reserve for such Election Year as Deferred Compensation are to be distributed following Separation from Service or as an In-Service Withdrawal. A Participant may make a separate distribution election for each Election Year; provided, however, that such election shall apply to any regular pay and bonus deferred with respect to that Election Year. Elections for distribution following Separation from Service will continue from Election Year to Election Year unless a new election is made by the Participant. A Participant must affirmatively elect an In-Service Withdrawal for an Election Year or the Participant shall be deemed to have elected a distribution following Separation from Service.
     
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Vested Portion of a Participant's Company Accruals and the earnings thereon shall become distributable only following such Participant's Separation from Service; such distribution shall be made to the Participant in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of Section 4.2.
     
(b) Each participant may elect, on a form provided by the Administrator, that distributions which are to be made to the Participant in installments following Separation from Service shall be deemed to come first from the money market fund included as a Benchmark Fund, in Appendix A, to the extent the Participant's hypothetical Account is invested in such money market fund. If a Participant does not make such an election, the distribution shall be deemed to come proportionally from each Benchmark Fund in which the Participant's Account is deemed to be invested. If a Participant makes such election and the amount allocated to the money market fund in the Participant's Account is less than the amount of the distribution, the remaining portion of the distribution shall be deemed to come proportionally from the remaining Benchmark Funds in which the Participant's Account is deemed to be invested. Any election under this subsection 4.1(b) shall be effective as soon as practicable after the election is received by the Administrator.
the Participant's Account for which the Participant has elected distribution following Separation from Service may be distributed in any of the following forms, as elected by the Participant: (i) a lump sum cash payment within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service; (ii) annual cash installments payable each January over a designated term not to exceed twenty (20) years, commencing in the January immediately following the year of the Participant's Separation from Service; or (iii) five (5) annual cash installments commencing in the sixth (6
th
) January following such Participant's Separation from Service and
- 12 -
continuing in each of the four (4) immediately following Januaries. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the balance credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Reserve Account is less than $10,000 upon a Participant's Separation from Service, such Participant's Deferred Compensation Reserve Account shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service. If a Participant has elected distribution following Separation from Service for an Election Year and has incurred a Separation from Service during such Election Year, upon the subsequent Reinstatement of such Participant within the same Election Year, such election shall apply to any additional deferrals made for such Election Year.
     
(b)
In-Service Withdrawal
. Subject to procedures established by the Administrator, at the time that a Participant makes an Election for an Election Year, the Participant may elect to receive an In-Service Withdrawal, occurring or beginning in a future calendar year specified by the Participant, of the Deferred Compensation attributable to that Election (specified as a dollar amount or as a percentage); provided, however, that the year in which such withdrawal begins shall be no earlier than the third (3
rd
) calendar year following the calendar year in which the Deferred Compensation is credited to the Participant's Account. The Participant may elect to have amounts subject to an In-Service Withdrawal election distributed in annual cash installments paid over a term of two (2) to five (5) years or as a single lump sum cash payment. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, if the balance credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Reserve is $10,000 or less on the date an In-Service Withdrawal is scheduled to commence in installments, payment will be in the form of a single lump sum cash payment.
     
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, Company Accruals and related earnings are not available for scheduled In-Service Withdrawals.
     
(c)
Installments
. For purposes of Section 4.2(a) and (b), the amount of any installment payment shall be computed as the Participant's current distributable interest divided by the remaining unpaid installments (including the installment being computed).
     
(d)
Separation from Service Prior to Receipt of In-Service Withdrawal
. If a Participant incurs a Separation from Service prior to the date elected by the Participant for an In-Service Withdrawal, the portion of the Participant's Account subject to the In-Service Withdrawal election shall be distributed in a lump sum cash payment within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service. If a Participant receiving scheduled in-service annual installment distributions incurs a Separation from Service prior to receiving the last of the installments, the Participant will receive the remaining installments in a lump sum within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service.
     
(e)
Failure to Elect Form of Distribution
. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d), amounts allocated to the Participant's Account for which no distribution election has been made shall be distributed in the form of a single lump sum cash payment made within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service.
     
(f)
Distribution Following Death of Participant
. If the Participant dies before distribution of his or her account has begun or after distribution has begun but before the Vested Portion of the Participant's Account is fully distributed, the undistributed Vested Portion of the account shall be distributed to the Participant's beneficiary in a single lump sum cash payment within the ninety (90) days immediately following the Participant's death. If a Participant fails to designate a beneficiary in accordance with Section 4.5, or if the beneficiary designated by the Participant does not survive the Participant, the default beneficiary shall be determined in accordance with Section 4.5 and the distribution to such default beneficiary shall be in the form of a single lump sum as provided above, notwithstanding any designation by the Participant.
     
(g)
Non-Vested Amounts
. Upon a Participant's Separation from Service, except as provided under Section 3.4, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Plan or to the Participant for the part of the Participant's account that is not the Vested Portion.
     
(h)
Permissible Delays in Distribution

(b) A separate change may be made with respect to each Election Year beginning on or after January 1, 2001, and with respect to the Participant's Account attributable to Deferred Compensation and Company Accruals as of December 31, 2000. A request for change shall become effective on the first anniversary (the "Anniversary Date") of the date such request was received by the Administrator, provided such request shall be invalid if the Participant has a Separation from Service as described in Section 1.26 (but not including Section 1.26(d) or (e)) prior to the Anniversary Date, or, as to Deferred Compensation relating to any Election Year, if any amount of such Deferred Compensation for an Election Year would otherwise become distributable prior to the Anniversary Date.
     
Each Participant may designate a beneficiary on a form, provided by the Administrator, to receive distributions made pursuant to Section 4.2.

If a legal guardian or conservator is appointed for any person to whom any payment is payable under this Plan, then, upon proof to the Administrator of such appointment, amounts which would otherwise be paid under this Plan to such person shall be paid to the legal guardian or conservator.
