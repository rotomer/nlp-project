MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
BETHESDA, MD  April 22, 2010  Marriott International, Inc. (NYSE:MAR) today reported first quarter 2010 results, exceeding its revenue per available room (REVPAR) and diluted earnings per share (EPS) expectations.
FIRST QUARTER 2010 RESULTS
First quarter 2010 net income totaled $83 million, a 5 percent decline compared to first quarter 2009 adjusted net income. Diluted EPS totaled $0.22, down $0.02 from adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter. On February 11, 2010, the company forecasted first quarter diluted EPS of $0.15 to $0.21.
Reported net income was $83 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a reported net loss of $23 million in the year-ago quarter. Reported diluted EPS was $0.22 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to reported diluted losses per share of $0.06 in the first quarter of 2009.
Adjusted results for the 2009 first quarter exclude $129 million pretax ($84 million after-tax and $0.24 per diluted share) of restructuring costs and other charges and $26 million of non-cash charges ($0.07 per diluted share) in the provision for income taxes.
J.W. Marriott, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, "In the first quarter we welcomed increasing numbers of business guests to our hotels as travelers got back to work in most markets around the world. Corporate roomnights for the Marriott Hotels & Resort brand in North America rose 16 percent in the first quarter as business demand strengthened dramatically. At the same time, leisure demand remained solid as vacationers continued to find memorable holiday experiences and good values. While first quarter room rates were generally lower than last year, as occupancy levels continue to improve, we see higher
 
room rates on the horizon. In fact, we anticipate that North American systemwide REVPAR will increase by 3 to 6 percent for the full year 2010 with higher room rates by year end. International demand trends are even stronger. We expect REVPAR outside North America will increase 4 to 7 percent on a constant dollar basis in 2010 reflecting strong demand in Europe, South America and Asia.
Over 8,000 new rooms joined our system during the first quarter including the JW Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE, the JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort and Spa, and the Shanghai Marriott Hotel Changfeng Park, our 47th hotel in China. We also launched our newest brand, The Autograph Collection, with two new properties, Casa Monica Hotel in St. Augustine Florida and the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Asheville, North Carolina.
With stronger demand and meaningful unit growth, fee revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. 2010 is shaping up to be a good year."
REVPAR for the company's worldwide comparable company-operated properties was flat (a 1.0 percent decline using constant dollars) in the 2010 first quarter and REVPAR for the company's worldwide comparable systemwide properties declined 0.7 percent (a 1.3 percent decline using constant dollars).
International comparable company-operated REVPAR rose 5.8 percent (a 1.5 percent increase using constant dollars), including a 4.5 percent decline in average daily rate (a 8.3 percent decline using constant dollars) in the first quarter of 2010.
In North America, comparable company-operated REVPAR declined 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2010. REVPAR at the company's comparable company-operated North American full-service and luxury hotels (including , and ) was down 1.2 percent with a 7.8 percent decline in average daily rate.
Marriott Hotels & Resorts
The Ritz-Carlton
Renaissance Hotels
Marriott added 44 new properties (8,361 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio in the 2010 first quarter and seven properties (1,146 rooms) exited the system during the quarter. At quarter-end, the company's lodging group encompassed 3,457 properties and timeshare resorts for a total of over 603,000 rooms.
 
The company's worldwide pipeline of hotels under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development totaled over 95,000 rooms in more than 600 hotels at quarter-end.
MARRIOTT REVENUES totaled over $2.6 billion in the 2010 first quarter compared to approximately $2.5 billion for the first quarter of 2009. Base management and franchise fees rose 1 percent to $216 million reflecting fees from new hotels offset by slightly lower REVPAR. First quarter incentive management fees declined 7 percent to $40 million. In the first quarter, 23 percent of company-managed hotels earned incentive management fees compared to 25 percent in the year-ago quarter. Approximately 60 percent of incentive management fees came from hotels outside North America in the 2010 quarter compared to 54 percent in the 2009 quarter.
Worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins declined 110 basis points in the first quarter reflecting increasing occupancy and declining rate partially offset by efficiency improvements at the property level. House profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America increased 40 basis points and North American comparable company-operated house profit margins declined 180 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses, declined $1 million in the 2010 first quarter, to $12 million, primarily reflecting the impact of lower operating results in owned and leased hotels partially offset by $4 million of termination fees.
First quarter adjusted Timeshare segment contract sales increased 10 percent to $172 million excluding an $8 million allowance for fractional and residential contract cancellations recorded in the quarter. In the prior year's quarter, adjusted Timeshare segment contract sales totaled $157 million excluding a $28 million allowance for contract cancellations.
In the first quarter, timeshare sales and services revenue totaled $285 million and, net of expenses, totaled $50 million for the quarter. Adjusting for restructuring and other charges, as well as the impact of consolidation of securitized loans as if such consolidation had occurred at the beginning of 2009, first quarter 2009 timeshare sales and services revenue would have totaled $254 million and, net of direct expenses, would have totaled $25 million. These adjustments for the 2009 quarter are shown on page A-14.
 
Timeshare development revenue, net of expense, benefited from stronger demand, higher closing efficiency, favorable reportability and lower marketing and sales costs.
Timeshare segment results include Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct expenses, as well as base management fees, equity earnings (losses), noncontrolling interest, interest expense and general, administrative and other expenses associated with the timeshare business. Timeshare segment results for the 2010 first quarter, shown on page A-6, totaled $25 million, including $14 million of interest expense related to the consolidation of securitized Timeshare notes. On February 11, 2010, the company provided Timeshare segment guidance of $30 million to $40 million, excluding interest expense associated with securitized Timeshare notes.
GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE and OTHER expenses for the 2010 first quarter increased 1 percent to $138 million, compared to adjusted expenses of $136 million in the year-ago quarter. The 2010 first quarter benefited from $6 million in guarantee reserve reversals and $4 million of lower receivable reserves partially offset by higher legal expenses of $3 million. The 2009 first quarter benefited from $8 million of incentive compensation and other accrual reversals and a $5 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation.
GAINS AND OTHER INCOME totaled $1 million primarily reflecting gains on the sale of real estate. The prior year's first quarter gains and other income totaled $25 million and included a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of debt, $3 million of gains on the sale of real estate and other income and $1 million of preferred returns from joint venture investments.
INTEREST EXPENSE increased $16 million to $45 million in the first quarter primarily due to $14 million of interest expense related to the consolidation of debt associated with securitized Timeshare notes, lower capitalized interest and interest associated with deferred compensation partially offset by lower debt balances and interest rates. Adjusting for the impact of consolidation of securitized loans as if such consolidation had occurred at the beginning of 2009, first quarter 2009 interest expense would have totaled $45 million, flat with 2010 first quarter interest expense.
 
EQUITY IN (LOSSES) EARNINGS totaled an $11 million loss in the quarter compared to a $3 million adjusted loss in the year-ago quarter. The $8 million decline primarily reflected a $4 million increase in cancellation reserves at one Timeshare joint venture and impairment charges of $3 million associated with two investments.
Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)
EBITDA totaled $221 million in the 2010 first quarter. In the 2009 first quarter, adjusted EBITDA totaled $215 million. If the consolidation of securitized timeshare notes had occurred at the beginning of 2009, adjusted EBITDA in 2009 would have totaled $235 million.
BALANCE SHEET
At the end of the first quarter 2010, total debt was $3,269 million and cash balances totaled $118 million, compared to $2,298 million in debt and $115 million of cash at year-end 2009. The increase in debt included $1,043 million of debt associated with securitized Timeshare mortgage notes now required to be consolidated, as noted below. At the end of the first quarter 2010, Marriott had borrowings of $396 million outstanding under its $2.4 billion bank revolver.
COMMON STOCK
Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS totaled 373.3 million in the 2010 first quarter compared to weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of 360.5 million used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter.
The remaining share repurchase authorization, as of March 26, 2010, totaled 21.3 million shares.No share repurchases are planned for 2010.
IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES
The company adopted ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 (formerly referred to as FAS 166 and 167) at the beginning of 2010, which required consolidation of entities associated with securitized Timeshare notes and impacts the ongoing accounting for those notes. With the consolidation of the existing portfolio of securitized loans on the first day of fiscal 2010, assets increased by $970 million, liabilities increased by $1,116 million, and shareholders' equity
 
decreased by $146 million. No change in net cash flow is anticipated as a result of the accounting changes. If the consolidation had occurred at the beginning of 2009, first quarter 2009 adjusted revenue would have increased to $2,540 million, first quarter 2009 adjusted EBITDA would have increased to $235 million, first quarter 2009 interest expense would have increased to $45 million and first quarter 2009 adjusted pretax income would have increased to $141 million. See the tables on pages A-14, A-15, A-16, A-17 and A-18 of the accompanying schedules for 2009 quarterly and full year Timeshare segment results adjusted as if the accounting changes had been made on the first day of fiscal 2009.
SECOND QUARTER 2010 OUTLOOK
For the second quarter, the company assumes comparable systemwide REVPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 4 to 6 percent in North America, 8 to 10 percent outside North America and 5 to 7 percent worldwide.
In the 2010 second quarter, the company assumes Timeshare contract sales will total $175 million to $185 million and Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct expenses, will total approximately $40 million to $45 million. With these assumptions, Timeshare segment results for the second quarter, including interest expense associated with securitized notes, are expected to total $20 million to $25 million.
FULL YEAR 2010 OUTLOOK
For the full year 2010, the company assumes comparable systemwide REVPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 3 to 6 percent in North America, 4 to 7 percent outside North America and 3 to 6 percent worldwide.
The company expects to open 25,000 to 30,000 rooms in 2010 as most hotels expected to open are already under construction or undergoing conversion from other brands.
The company continues to estimate that, on a full-year basis, one point of worldwide systemwide REVPAR impacts total fees by approximately $10 million to $15 million pretax and owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expense, by roughly $4 million pretax.
 
For its timeshare business, the company assumes 2010 timeshare contract sales will be slightly higher than 2009 levels. For 2010, Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct expenses, is expected to total $185 million to $195 million. Timeshare segment results for 2010, including interest expense associated with previously securitized notes, is expected to total $95 million to $105 million.
The company expects its 2010 general, administrative and other expenses to total $650 million to $660 million reflecting higher incentive compensation.
 
 
Based upon the assumptions above, full year 2010 EBITDA is expected to total $985 million to $1,040 million. Assuming the investment spending levels below, adjusted total debt is expected to decline $400 million to $500 million by year end 2010.
The company expects investment spending in 2010 will total approximately $500 million, including capital expenditures totaling $150 million to $200 million, of which maintenance capital spending is expected to total $50 million. Investment spending will also include new mezzanine financing and mortgage loans, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. The investment in net timeshare development is not included above as the company expects cost of goods sold in the timeshare business will exceed timeshare inventory spending in 2010.

In our press release and schedules, and on the related conference call, we report certain financial measures that are not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We discuss management's reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we refer to (identified by a double asterisk on the preceding pages). Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated and/or presented differently than measures with the same or similar names that are reported by other companies, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.
Management evaluates non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of Timeshare strategy - impairment charges incurred in the 2009 third quarter, restructuring costs and other charges incurred in the 2009 first quarter through the 2009 fourth quarter, and certain tax expenses incurred in the 2009 first quarter, because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before material charges. These non-GAAP measures also facilitate management's comparison of results from our on-going operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies.
Adjusted Measures That Exclude Certain Charges, Costs, and Other Expenses.
In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segment's timeshare, luxury residential, and luxury fractional real estate development businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to take the following actions: (1) for our luxury residential projects, reduce prices, convert certain proposed projects to other uses, sell some undeveloped land, and not pursue further Marriott-funded residential development projects; (2) reduce prices for existing luxury fractional units; (3) continue short-term promotions for our U.S. timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases; and (4) for our European timeshare and fractional resorts, continue promotional pricing and marketing incentives and not pursue further development. As a result of these decisions, we recorded third quarter 2009 pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income ($502 million after-tax), including $614 million of pretax charges impacting operating income under the "Timeshare strategy-impairment charges" caption, and $138 million of pretax charges impacting non-operating income under the "Timeshare strategy-impairment charges (non-operating)" caption.
Timeshare Strategy - Impairment Charges.
During the latter part of 2008 and particularly the fourth quarter, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally due, in part, to the failures and near failures of several large financial service companies and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt by the downturn in market conditions and particularly, the significant deterioration in the credit markets. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, contract cancellation allowances, and charges and reserves associated with expected fundings, loans, Timeshare inventory, accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, valuation of Timeshare residual interests, hedge ineffectiveness, and asset impairments. We responded by implementing various cost saving measures, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and which continued in 2009, and resulted in first quarter 2009 restructuring costs of $2 million, second quarter 2009 restructuring costs of $33 million, third quarter 2009 restructuring costs of $9 million, and 2009 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $7 million that were directly related to the downturn. We also incurred other first quarter 2009, second quarter 2009 and fourth quarter 2009 charges totaling $127 million, $24 million, and $12 million respectively, as well as $1 million in net other credits in the 2009 third quarter, that were directly related to the downturn, including asset impairment charges, accounts receivable and guarantee charges, reserves associated with loans, reversal of the liability related to expected fundings, Timeshare contract cancellation allowances, and charges related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests.
Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.
Certain tax expenses included $26 million in the 2009 first quarter of non-cash charges primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries, an issue we are contesting with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").
Certain Tax Expenses.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Management considers EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. EBITDA is used by analysts, lenders, investors and others, as well as by us, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.
Management also evaluates adjusted EBITDA which excludes: (1) Timeshare strategy - impairment charges of $752 million incurred in the 2009 third quarter; (2) the 2009 fourth quarter restructuring costs and other charges totaling $19 million; (3) the 2009 third quarter restructuring costs and other charges totaling $8 million; (4) the 2009 second quarter restructuring costs and other charges totaling $57 million; and (5) the 2009 first quarter restructuring costs and other charges totaling $129 million. Management excludes the restructuring costs and other charges incurred in the 2009 first through fourth quarters and the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges recorded in the 2009 third quarter for the reasons noted above under "Measures That Exclude Certain Charges, Costs, and Other Expenses."
Adjusted EBITDA.
 
 
 
As of the first day of fiscal year 2010, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-16 "Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets" (formerly known as FAS No. 166, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140") and ASU No. 2009-17 "Consolidations (Topic 810); Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities" (formerly known as FAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)," which required consolidating previously securitized pools of Timeshare notes and impacts the ongoing accounting for those notes. Management evaluates non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of these standards in the current year or include the impact of these standards as if we had adopted them early in order to better perform year-over-year comparisons on a comparable basis.
Adjusted Measures that Exclude the Impact of New Accounting Standards or Reflect Their Early Adoption.
