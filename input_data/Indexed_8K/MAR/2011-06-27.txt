(b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "").

certifying in the case of form W-8ECI that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero (or if such Lender cannot provide at such time such form because it is not entitled to reduced withholding under a treaty and the payments are not effectively connected income), withholding tax at such rate (or at the then existing U.S. statutory rate if the Lender cannot provide such a form) shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" as defined in Section 2.12(a) unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate form certifying that a zero rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such zero rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.07(h) and was entitled to payments under Section 2.12(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term "" shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States interest withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this Section 2.12(e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the relevant Lender considers to be confidential, such Lender shall give notice thereof to the Company and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. For purposes of this paragraph (e) the term "" means a Lender that certifies in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower that (i) it is not a bank within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(A), (ii) it is not a 10% shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(B) and (iii) it is not a controlled foreign corporation related to any Borrower within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(C).

(f) For any period with respect to which a Person that is required pursuant to Section 2.12(e) to provide a Borrower with any documentation described therein but has failed to provide a Borrower with such documentation or notice that it cannot provide such form or other documentation ( if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form or other documentation originally was required to be provided, or if such form or other documentation otherwise is not required under the first sentence of subsection (e) above), such Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.12(a)

(g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
(h) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement, in the event that a Lender that originally provided such form or other documentation as may be required under Section 2.12(e) thereafter ceases to qualify for complete exemption from withholding tax, such Lender may assign its interest under this Agreement to any Eligible Assignee and such assignee shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Section 2.12 as the assignor provided that the rate of withholding tax applicable to such assignee shall not exceed the rate then applicable to the assignor.
(i) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 2.12 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and the termination of the Commitments.

Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall promptly deliver to the Company (through the Administrative Agent) the Notes, if any, of such former Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.12 or 3.05) or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article X with respect to any such unpaid obligations.

Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans and other obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Revolving Loan Note and/or a Competitive Bid Loan Note, as applicable, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans to such Borrower in addition to such accounts or records.

Credit Agreement
Company
I am Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. In that capacity I, together with other attorneys in the Company's Law Department who have given substantive attention to the representation described in this paragraph (collectively, "") have acted as legal counsel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and as such have acted on their behalf in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes (collectively, the "").
we
Credit Documents
In that connection, we have examined (i) the Credit Documents; (ii) the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date hereof, and the by-laws of the Company, as now in effect (collectively, the ""); and (iii) the documents furnished by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Credit Agreement. We have also examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of (i) the agreements, instruments and documents that affect or purport to affect the obligations of the Company under the Credit Documents or the right of the Company to borrow money and the other transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and (ii) such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and
Constituent Documents
 
other documents as we have deemed necessary and appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed, as to all parties other than the Company, (i) the genuineness of all signatures, the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of the documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the executed copies of all documents submitted to us as execution copies, and (ii) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the documents, pursuant to full power, authority and legal right, and the validity and enforceability of the documents against such parties.
In giving the opinions set forth below, we have also relied upon representations as to matters of fact (but not as to matters of law) made by the Company in Section 5.01 of the Credit Agreement.
We do not purport to express any opinion herein concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than the District of Columbia, the State of Delaware (but only insofar as set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
In connection with our opinions qualified by "known to us", "to our knowledge" or a similar phrase to qualify a statement in this opinion letter means that those attorneys in the Law Department who have given substantive attention to the representation described in the first introductory paragraph of this opinion letter do not have current actual knowledge that the statement is incorrect. Such terms do not include any knowledge of other attorneys in the Law Department or any constructive or imputed notice of any matters or item or information.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed except where the failure to so qualify or be licensed would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted except where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Documents, and the borrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement, are within the corporate powers of the Company and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and do not (A) contravene the Constituent Documents, (B) violate the applicable provisions of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award that names the Company and is specifically directed to the Company or its property, (C) conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or
 
instrument pertaining to borrowed money binding on or, to the best of our knowledge, affecting the Company, or (D) result in or require the creation or its imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the properties of the Company.
3. Except as have been obtained, no authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Documents, except and to the extent that any failure to obtain such authorization, approval or other action would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
4. Each Credit Document has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
5. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company," or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
We also hereby confirm, to the best of our knowledge after investigation, that there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or overtly threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, arbitrator or governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or other instrumentality, whether domestic or foreign, (i) that is, in our opinion, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) challenging or otherwise calling into question the validity of the Credit Documents or the power and authority of the Company to execute and deliver the Credit Documents, or any of them, or to perform its obligations thereunder.
This opinion letter is furnished by us as counsel for the Company and may be relied upon by you or your counsel only in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents. It may not be used or relied upon by you or your counsel or quoted by you or your counsel for any other purpose or by any other person, nor may copies be delivered to any other person, without, in each instance, our prior written consent.
This opinion letter is given as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion letter to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention, including any subsequent changes in law or regulation, or the interpretation thereof.
 
A signed counterpart of this opinion letter may be delivered via telecopier with the intention that it have the same effect as the opinion letter itself.
