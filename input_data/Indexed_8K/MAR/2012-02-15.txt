MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BETHESDA, MD  February 15, 2012 - Marriott International, Inc. (NYSE: MAR) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2011 results.
The company completed the spin-off of its Timeshare segment on November 21, 2011. Because of Marriott's significant continuing involvement in the business after the spin-off through licensing and other agreements, Timeshare segment results for periods prior to the spin-off date continue to be included in the company's historical financial results. However, to evaluate the
 
performance of the company excluding the impact of the timeshare business, the company is adjusting results and previously provided guidance as if the spin-off had occurred on the first day of fiscal 2010. Timeshare spin-off adjustments include items such as the removal of timeshare business operating results and spin-off transaction costs, as well as the addition of license fees and other related items. See pages A-1 through A-6 for reported results, the timeshare spin-off adjustments and adjusted results.
FOURTH QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted net income totaled $159 million, an 18 percent increase compared to fourth quarter 2010 adjusted net income. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.46, a 31 percent increase from adjusted diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter. On October 5, 2011, the company forecasted fourth quarter diluted EPS of $0.45 to $0.50, which assumed the timeshare spin-off would occur at year-end 2011. Adjusting for the timeshare spin-off as if the spin-off had occurred the first day of fiscal 2010, the company's guidance would have been $0.40 to $0.44 as shown on page A-18.
Reported net income totaled $141 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $173 million in the year-ago quarter. Reported diluted EPS was $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2011 exclude $14 million ($18 million after-tax and $0.05 per diluted share) of timeshare spin-off adjustments.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2010 exclude $22 million ($13 million after-tax and $0.04 per diluted share) of timeshare spin-off adjustments. Adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2010 also exclude $25 million after-tax ($0.07 per diluted share) of impairment charges and certain tax items, including an $85 million ($0.22 per diluted share) non-cash benefit in the provision for income taxes.
J.W. Marriott, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, "2011 was a great year. Occupancies and room rates improved at our hotels in most markets around the world. We increased our global hotel distribution and spun off our timeshare business as Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, a new separately traded public company. Return on
 
invested capital increased dramatically and meaningful top line growth in our lodging business helped drive base and franchise fees beyond their prior peak in 2008. Adjusted earnings per share was outstanding and we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
"Our system has never looked better. We opened 210 properties with nearly 32,000 rooms during the year, including 80 hotels flying our new AC Hotels by Marriott flag in Europe. With great momentum in international markets, the growth rate for our hotel rooms outside the U.S. was higher than within the U.S. The Autograph Collection made its debut in Europe adding nine properties, including the four spectacular Boscolo hotels. And our EDITION brand kicked into high gear with new hotel announcements, including the iconic Clock Tower building in New York. In total, our hotel development pipeline increased to over 110,000 rooms as we signed new management and franchise agreements for more than 320 hotels with over 50,000 rooms in 2011, most for hotels yet to open.
"We are bullish about the long-term growth prospects for both Marriott and the global lodging industry. With a growing middle class and rapid economic growth in many emerging markets, global demand is increasing steadily. In the U.S., supply growth remains modest. As a result, we expect revenue per available room to continue to improve in most markets. Marriott is well positioned to benefit from these global macro trends. Our products are high quality, our guest satisfaction is very high, and our brands are preferred by owners and franchisees. New hotel openings and renovations of existing hotels continue to energize our brands, and with new designs and services, we continue to find new ways to engage our guests. We expect 2012 to be an exciting year."
For the 2011 fourth quarter, REVPAR for worldwide comparable systemwide properties increased 5.9 percent (a 6.3 percent increase using actual dollars). Excluding the Middle East and Japan markets, worldwide comparable systemwide REVPAR rose 6.2 percent (a 6.5 percent increase using actual dollars).
International comparable systemwide REVPAR rose 4.1 percent (a 5.9 percent increase using actual dollars), including a 4.5 percent increase in average daily rate (a 6.3 percent increase using actual dollars) in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the Middle East and Japan markets, international comparable systemwide REVPAR increased 5.6 percent (a 6.9 percent increase using actual dollars).
 
In North America, comparable systemwide REVPAR increased 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, including a 3.2 percent increase in average daily rate. REVPAR for comparable systemwide North American full-service and luxury hotels (including , and ) increased 5.8 percent with a 3.4 percent increase in average daily rate. REVPAR for comparable systemwide North American limited-service hotels (including and ) increased 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter with a 3.4 percent increase in average daily rate.

Marriott added 40 new properties (6,925 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio in the 2011 fourth quarter, including Shanghai Marriott City Centre, the Renaissance and Courtyard Doha City Center hotels and the Scrub Island Resort, Spa and Marina, an Autograph Collection hotel in the British Virgin Islands. Nine properties (1,946 rooms) exited the system during the quarter. At year-end, the company's lodging group encompassed 3,718 properties and timeshare resorts for a total of 643,196 rooms.
The company's worldwide pipeline of hotels under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development totaled nearly 700 properties with over 110,000 rooms at year-end. During 2011, the company signed new management and franchise agreements for more than 320 hotels with over 50,000 rooms.
MARRIOTT ADJUSTED REVENUES totaled $3.4 billion in the 2011 fourth quarter compared to approximately $3.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted base management and franchise fees rose 9 percent to $346 million reflecting higher REVPAR and fees from new hotels. Incentive fees declined 1 percent reflecting lower incentive fees in the Middle East and continued weakness in the greater Washington, DC market. In the fourth quarter, 27 percent of worldwide company-managed hotels earned incentive management fees compared to 26 percent in the year-ago quarter.
 
Worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 60 basis points in the fourth quarter reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases and strong productivity. House profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America increased 20 basis points and North American comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 100 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses, increased $15 million in the 2011 fourth quarter, to $56 million, largely due to higher credit card and residential branding fee revenues and improved operating results at owned and leased hotels.
ADJUSTED GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE and OTHER expenses for the 2011 fourth quarter increased 2 percent to $219 million, compared to adjusted expenses of $215 million in the year-ago quarter.
ADJUSTED GAINS AND OTHER INCOME totaled $1 million compared to $8 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting net gains on the sale of real estate in the 2010 fourth quarter.
Adjusted Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $316 million in the 2011 fourth quarter, a 12 percent increase over 2010 fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $282 million. See pages A-12 for the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA calculations.
FULL YEAR 2011 RESULTS
For the full year 2011, adjusted net income totaled $475 million, a 23 percent increase over full year 2010 adjusted net income. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $1.31, an increase of 28 percent from adjusted diluted EPS a year ago.
Reported net income totaled $198 million for full year 2011 compared to reported net income of $458 million a year ago. Reported diluted EPS was $0.55 for 2011 compared to reported diluted EPS of $1.21 for 2010.
 
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2011 exclude $300 million ($260 million after-tax and $0.72 per diluted share) of timeshare spin-off adjustments. Adjusted results for the full year 2011 also exclude $28 million pretax ($17 million after-tax and $0.05 per diluted share) of non-cash impairment and other charges.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2010 exclude $76 million ($47 million after-tax and $0.12 per diluted share) of timeshare spin-off adjustments. Adjusted results for full year 2010 also exclude $25 million after-tax ($0.07 per diluted share) of impairment charges and certain tax items, including an $85 million ($0.23 per diluted share) non-cash benefit in the provision for income taxes.
REVPAR for the company's worldwide comparable systemwide properties increased 6.4 percent (a 7.1 percent increase using actual dollars) in 2011. Excluding the Middle East and Japan markets, worldwide comparable systemwide REVPAR rose 6.9 percent (a 7.4 percent increase using actual dollars).
International comparable systemwide REVPAR for 2011 increased 6.3 percent (a 9.6 percent increase using actual dollars), including a 0.9 percent increase in occupancy and a 4.9 percent increase in average daily rate (an 8.1 percent increase using actual dollars). Excluding the Middle East and Japan markets, international comparable systemwide REVPAR increased 8.9 percent (an 11.9 percent increase using actual dollars).
In North America, comparable systemwide REVPAR increased 6.5 percent in 2011. REVPAR at the company's comparable systemwide North American full-service and luxury hotels (including , and ) increased 5.8 percent with a 1.3 percent increase in occupancy and an average daily rate increase of 3.7 percent. REVPAR for comparable systemwide North American limited-service hotels (including and ) increased 7.0 percent with a 3.0 percent increase in average daily rate.

MARRIOTT ADJUSTED REVENUES totaled nearly $11.0 billion in 2011 compared to $10.2 billion in 2010. Total adjusted fees in 2011 were $1,307 million, an increase of 10 percent from the prior year. Stronger base management and franchise fees reflected the increase in worldwide
 
REVPAR and unit growth across the system. Incentive management fees increased 7 percent reflecting higher property-level profit due to worldwide REVPAR increases and continued cost control, as well as international unit growth. For full year 2011, 29 percent of company-operated hotels earned incentive management fees compared to 27 percent in the prior year. Approximately two-thirds of incentive management fees came from hotels outside North America in both 2011 and 2010.
Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses, totaled $140 million in 2011 compared to $91 million in 2010. Results were primarily impacted by an increase in credit card and residential branding fees, stronger results at owned and leased hotels and an increase in termination fees net of property closing costs.
ADJUSTED GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE and OTHER expenses in 2011 increased $50 million to $643 million, an 8 percent increase compared to adjusted expenses in 2010, largely due to higher compensation costs, higher costs associated with growth in international markets and a year-over-year increase in legal expenses.
ADJUSTED GAINS AND OTHER INCOME totaled $8 million in 2011 primarily reflecting net gains on the sale of real estate. Adjusted gains and other income of $15 million in 2010 included $13 million of net gains on the sale of real estate.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $992 million in 2011 compared to 2010 adjusted EBITDA of $885 million, a 12 percent increase. See pages A-13 for the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA calculations.
BALANCE SHEET
At year-end 2011, total debt was $2,171 million and cash balances totaled $102 million, compared to $2,829 million in debt and $505 million of cash at year-end 2010. The $658 million decline in total debt from year-end 2010 primarily resulted from the spin-off of the Timeshare segment and the transfer of its non-recourse debt, which was partially offset by a $331 million increase in commercial paper borrowings.
 
COMMON STOCK
Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS totaled 346.4 million in the 2011 fourth quarter compared to 382.0 million in the year-ago quarter.
The company repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter at a cost of $200 million. For the full year 2011, the company repurchased 43.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.4 billion. On February 10, 2012, the board of directors increased the company's authorization to repurchase shares by 35 million shares to yield a total share authorization of 40.5 million shares.
FIRST QUARTER 2012 OUTLOOK
For the first quarter, the company expects comparable systemwide REVPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 5 to 6 percent in North America, 4 to 5 percent outside North America and 5 to 6 percent worldwide.
2012 OUTLOOK
The company expects full year 2012 comparable systemwide REVPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 5 to 7 percent in North America, outside North America and worldwide.
The company expects to open about 30,000 rooms in 2012 as most hotels expected to open are already under construction or undergoing conversion from other brands.
For 2012, assuming a strong U.S. dollar and modest fee revenue growth in hotels in Washington, DC, the company expects full year fee revenue could total $1,410 million to $1,450 million, growth of 8 to 11 percent over 2011 adjusted total fee revenue. The company expects owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expense, could total $130 million to $140 million in 2012.
Compared to prior assumptions for 2012 operating profit provided by the company on October 5, 2011, expectations today reflect 2011 actual results and greater precision resulting from the property-level budgeting process completed in the fourth quarter.
 
The company estimates that, on a full year basis, one point of worldwide systemwide REVPAR impacts total fees by approximately $20 million pretax and owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expense, by approximately $5 million pretax.
For 2012, the company expects general, administrative and other expenses to total $660 million to $670 million, an increase of 3 to 4 percent over 2011 adjusted expenses of $643 million.
Given these assumptions, 2012 diluted EPS could total $1.52 to $1.64.
 
 
The company expects investment spending in 2012 will total approximately $550 million to $750 million, including $50 million to $100 million for maintenance capital spending. Investment spending will also include other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), new mezzanine financing and mortgage notes, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. Assuming additional investment opportunities do not appear, roughly $1 billion could be returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
 
Based upon the assumptions above, full year 2012 EBITDA is expected to total $1,090 million to $1,150 million, a 10 to 16 percent increase over the prior year's adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2011 totaled $992 million and is shown on page A-13.

In our press release and schedules, and on the related conference call, we report certain financial measures that are not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We discuss management's reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we refer to (identified by a double asterisk on the preceding pages). Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated and/or presented differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.
("Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments"). On November 21, 2011 we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation ("MVW").
Adjusted Measures that Reflect the Timeshare Spin-off as if it had Occurred on the First Day of 2011, 2010
, or 2007, as applicable
As of the spin-off date, Marriott no longer beneficially owns any shares of MVW common stock and does not for periods after the spin-off date consolidate MVW's financial results as part of Marriott's financial reporting. However, because of Marriott's significant continuing involvement in MVW future operations (by virtue of the license and other agreements between Marriott and MVW), we continue to include our former Timeshare segment's historical financial results for periods before the spin-off date in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Under the license agreements we receive license fees consisting of a fixed annual fee of $50 million (subject to a periodic inflation adjustment), plus two percent of the gross sales price paid to MVW for initial developer sales of interests in vacation ownership units and residential real estate units and one percent of the gross sales price paid to MVW for resales of interests in vacation ownership units and residential real estate units, in each case that are identified with or use the Marriott or Ritz-Carlton marks.
In order to perform year-over-year comparisons on a comparable basis, management evaluates non-GAAP measures that, for periods prior to the spin-off date and for guidance that was provided on October 5, 2011 for the 2011 fourth quarter, assume the spin-off had occurred on the first day of 2011, 2010, or 2007, as applicable. The Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments remove the results of our former Timeshare segment, assume payment by MVW of estimated license fees of $60 million for 2011, $64 million for 2010, and $78 million for 2007 and remove the unallocated spin-off transaction costs of $34 million we incurred for full year 2011. We have also included certain corporate items not previously allocated to our former Timeshare segment in the Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments.
We provide adjusted measures that reflect Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments for illustrative and informational purposes only. These adjusted measures are not necessarily indicative of, and do not purport to represent, what our operating results would have been had the spin-off actually occurred on the first day of 2011, 2010, or 2007, as applicable. This information also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the spin-off. For additional information on the nature of the Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments, see the Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 21, 2011 upon completion of the spin-off.
Management evaluates non-GAAP measures that exclude certain 2011 charges, certain 2010 charges and tax items, and certain 2007 charges because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of material charges. These non-GAAP measures also facilitate management's comparison of results from our on-going operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies.
Adjusted Measures That Exclude Other Charges and Certain Tax items.
We recorded charges of $28 million in the 2011 third quarter, which included an $18 million other-than-temporary impairment of an investment in marketable securities (not allocated to any of our segments), and a $10 million charge related to the impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and an accounts receivable reserve, both of which were associated with a Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy.
2011 Other Charges.
We recorded pre-tax charges of $98 million in the 2010 fourth quarter in the "General, administrative and other" caption of our Income Statements. The charges included an $84 million impairment charge associated with a portion of the development costs of an internally developed software asset, which we elected to absorb rather than recovering from owners, and a $14 million impairment charge associated with the anticipated disposition of a land parcel. The $14 million charge impacted our North American Limited-Service segment and the $84 million charge was not allocated to any of our segments.
2010 Other Charges and Certain Tax Items.
 
Certain tax items reflect the tax impact of the $98 million in pre-tax charges described in the preceding paragraph as well as an $85 million decrease in tax expense we recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter for a settlement with the Appeals Division of the IRS that resolved all issues that arose in the audit of tax years 2005 through 2008. This settlement was due to the release of previously established tax liabilities for the treatment of funds received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not allocate taxes to segments.
. We recorded an after-tax charge of $54 million in the second quarter of 2007 related to the 2007 settlement of issues raised during the IRS' and Department of Labor's examination of the ESOP feature of our Employees' Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust. The charge reflected $35 million of excise taxes (impacting general, administrative, and other expenses), $13 million of interest expense on those excise taxes and $6 million of income tax expense primarily reflecting additional interest.
2007 Employee Stock Ownership ("ESOP") Settlement
is a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.
Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA")
We also evaluate Adjusted EBITDA, another non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects the following items, each of which we describe more fully above: (1) Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments; (2) an adjustment for $28 million of other charges for 2011; and (3) an adjustment for $98 million of other charges for 2010. We use Adjusted EBITDA to make period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges and to facilitate comparing results from our ongoing operations before material charges with those of other lodging companies.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Both of these non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting EBITDA's and Adjusted EBITDA's usefulness as comparative measures.
Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income because cost reimbursements revenue net of reimbursed costs expense is zero. We consider total revenues as adjusted for Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments and income before income taxes as adjusted for Timeshare Spin-off Adjustments and Other Charges to be meaningful metrics for the reasons noted above. In calculating adjusted pretax margin we consider total revenues as adjusted to further exclude cost reimbursements and therefore, adjusted pretax margin excluding cost reimbursements to be meaningful metrics as they represent that portion of revenue and pretax margin that impacts operating income and net income.
Adjusted Pretax Margin Excluding Adjusted Cost Reimbursements.
