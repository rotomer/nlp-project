The bylaws of Marriott International, Inc. ("Marriott") provide that the fiscal year of Marriott shall be fixed by the resolution of the board of directors (the "Board"). On May 4, 2012, the Board approved a resolution changing Marriott's financial reporting to a calendar year end beginning with the 2013 fiscal year. Marriott's 2013 fiscal year will begin on December 29, 2012 (the day after the end of the 2012 fiscal year) and will end on December 31, 2013. Subsequent fiscal years will begin on January 1 and end on December 31. Marriott's quarterly results will be for three month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, except that the period ending March 31, 2013 will also include December 29, 2012 through December 31, 2012. The company believes these changes will allow the simplification of transaction and reporting processes to support future growth. Historical results will not be restated.
Historically (and continuing for the 2012 fiscal year) Marriott's fiscal year was a 52-53 week fiscal year that ended on the Friday nearest to December 31. Historically (and continuing for the 2012 fiscal year) Marriott's quarterly results were for twelve week periods for the first, second, and third quarters and for a sixteen week period (or in some cases a seventeen week period) for the fourth quarter.
Marriott's Form 10-K for the 2013 fiscal year will include the period from December 29, 2012 to December 31, 2012. This period will also be included in Marriott's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2013. A copy of Marriott's press release is attached as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference.
 
On May 4, 2012, Marriott held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At the Annual Meeting, shareholders considered: 1) the election of the ten director nominees named in the proxy statement; 2) the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2012; and 3) an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of Marriott's named executive officers. Marriott's shareholders voted as follows on these matters:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On May 4, 2012 the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of thirteen cents ($0.13) per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on June 22, 2012 to shareholders of record on May 18, 2012. A copy of Marriott's press release is attached as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated by reference.

Bethesda, Md.  May 4, 2012  Marriott International, Inc.
