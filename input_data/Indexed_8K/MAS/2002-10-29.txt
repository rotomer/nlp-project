Exhibit 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: - --------------------- Samuel Cypert 313-792-6646 MASCO ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY SETTLEMENT OF BEHR CLASS ACTION LITIGATION, REAFFIRMS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2002 CONFERENCE CALL Taylor, Michigan (October 29, 2002) - Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) today announced preliminary settlements to resolve all class action lawsuits pending in the United States against the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, relating to exterior wood coating products formerly manufactured by Behr. The lawsuits involve claims of excessive mildew on wood surfaces to which the products were applied. All claims relating to the products would be dismissed without any admission of liability or wrongdoing following final court approval of the settlements. Based on the terms of the settlements, the Company believes that the ultimate aggregate cost will approximate or be less than its previous estimate of $200 million pre-tax. This estimate does not include any offsetting amounts that the Company and Behr expect to recover from liability insurers or other third parties, which the Company anticipates will be significant. The Company will record a third quarter 2002 charge related to the settlements of the Behr litigation. Recoveries from liability insurers or other third parties will be recorded at such time as they are agreed to, or otherwise received. Masco continues to expect reported third quarter earnings to be at the higher end of previously given guidance of $.41 to $.44 per common share, excluding the charge the Company will record in connection with the settlements of the Behr litigation. The Company also said that the positive sales and economic trends it experienced in its businesses in the first nine months of 2002 have continued thus far in the fourth quarter.
The Company also announced that it will hold a conference call regarding 2002 third quarter earnings on Tuesday, November 12, 2002 at 11:00 a.m. ET. Masco Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian will host the conference call. Participants in the call are asked to register five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time by dialing (913) 981-4910 (confirmation #159985).
