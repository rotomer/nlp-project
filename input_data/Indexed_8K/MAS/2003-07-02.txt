Baldwin and Weiser, with combined 2002 net sales of approximately $250 million, manufacture and distribute a wide range of architectural and decorative products for the home, including architectural hardware and locksets. The transaction is subject to final negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement, necessary regulatory clearances and Board of Director approvals. The transaction is expected to close later in 2003. According to Black & Decker Chairman and CEO Nolan D. Archibald, "The acquisition of these strong brand names provides an excellent strategic opportunity for Black & Decker's further expansion of its lock and door hardware business by offering these products in all price ranges." Masco Corporation Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian commented, "We believe that the combination of Baldwin and Weiser with Black & Decker will be advantageous for these businesses since architectural hardware and locksets are core businesses for Black & Decker."
