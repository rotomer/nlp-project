FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Samuel Cypert 313-792-6646 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS, UPDATES EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND ANNOUNCES INTENT TO INCREASE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND Taylor, Michigan (August 6, 2003) -- Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) today reported that net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, aided by acquisitions, increased 20 percent to a record $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion for the second quarter of 2002. Net income for the quarter increased seven percent to a record $229.6 million compared with $214.3 million for the 2002 second quarter. Earnings per common share also increased seven percent to $.46 compared with $.43 per common share for the 2002 second quarter. Although a record quarter, operating profit margins in 2003 have been negatively impacted by sales being somewhat lower than expected due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, by higher energy, insurance and pension costs and by a non-cash charge resulting from a system failure during efforts to convert to a new business system at one of the Company's European operations. Masco Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian commented, "Given the current economic environment, we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter and expect the second half of 2003 to be even stronger than the first half. If present positive sales and economic trends continue, the Company believes that third quarter earnings per common share should approximate $.48 to $.51 and continues to expect to achieve record sales and earnings for 2003 with full-year earnings in a range of $1.68 to $1.72 per common share, modestly higher than the Company's previous guidance."
Masco also announced that it is the present intent of the Company's Board of Directors to increase the quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter by 14 percent from $.14 to $.16 per common share. The new quarterly dividend reflects the Company's favorable long-term outlook, strong balance sheet and cash flow and recent tax law changes, and would make this the 45th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products. A conference call regarding the Company's second quarter 2003 sales and earnings is scheduled for Wednesday, August 6, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. ET. Participants in the call are asked to register five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time by dialing (719) 457-2661 (confirmation #375048). The conference call will be webcast simultaneously on the Company's website at www.masco.com and supplemental material, including the financial data referred to on the call and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP information provided on the call, will also be available on the website. A replay of the call will be available on Masco's website or by phone by dialing (719) 457-0820 (replay access code #375048) approximately two hours after the end of the call and will continue through August 12, 2003.

MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. See the attached tables for supplemental financial data and the corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, as well as for the year 2002. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. SECOND QUARTER 2003 - - Net sales, aided by acquisitions, were a record $2.8 billion, increasing 20 percent over 2002 second quarter sales, with North American sales increasing 15 percent and International sales increasing 54 percent. Stronger sales to non-retail customers, sales of acquired companies (particularly Service Partners in our Installation Group and Hansgrohe AG in our International Plumbing Products Group) and the favorable impact of foreign currencies more than offset slower sales growth with certain of the Company's retail customers. - - Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, second quarter 2003 consolidated net sales increased seven percent compared with second quarter 2002 sales; North American sales increased five percent and International sales increased 18 percent. In local currencies, International sales decreased one percent compared with 2002. - - Given the second quarter economic challenges, including adverse weather conditions in certain markets and higher energy costs reducing consumer disposable income, the Company is pleased with it's internal sales growth rate of seven percent during the quarter. This rate of organic growth (which includes the benefit of higher foreign currencies) compares favorably with most of our peer group. 1
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) - - The Company reported net income of $229.6 million or $.46 per common share (both records for any quarter in the Company's history), modestly above the Company's previous earnings guidance range of $.43 to $.45 per common share. - - In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge which reduced operating profit by approximately $23 million ($.03 per common share, after tax) with respect to a European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment. The charge resulted from business system failures at the unit during efforts to convert to a new business system in 2001 and 2002, and the unit management's inadequate response to the problem. The failures primarily impacted the accurate recognition of cost of sales for the operation's more than 20,000 SKU's of product manufactured and supplied by its subsidiaries and third parties in Asia, with a corresponding misstatement of certain balance sheet accounts. The Company has implemented corrective action to prevent this situation from occurring at the unit in the future, including replacement of members of the unit's senior management. While this unit remains profitable, nevertheless the Company is continuing to analyze the business unit's profitability and cash flow prospects and to determine if any impairment of assets exists, including a portion of the goodwill. - - The second quarter earnings charge of $.03 per common share, as mentioned above, was partially offset by net gains of $.02 per common share from the sale of marketable securities and other investments. - - Key retailer sales growth in the second quarter of 2003 increased six percent, compared with a four percent increase in the first quarter of 2003. Combined sales to Home Depot, Lowe's and Wal-Mart increased by approximately six percent in the 2003 second quarter compared with a three percent increase in the first quarter of 2003 and an 11 percent increase in the 2002 second quarter. 2
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) - - Sales by segment in the 2003 second quarter versus the 2002 second quarter were: - Cabinets and Related Products sales were up nine percent; - Plumbing Products sales were up 31 percent; - Installation and Other Services sales were up 47 percent; - Decorative Architectural Products sales were up seven percent; and - Other Specialty Products sales increased 14 percent. Particularly strong product sales in the quarter included assembled cabinets at retail, installed sales of non-insulation products, paints and stains and vinyl windows. - - Gross margins were 30.6 percent in the 2003 second quarter compared with 33.0 percent in 2002. - - Operating profit margins decreased to 14.0 percent compared with 17.1 percent in the second quarter of 2002. - - Excluding the pre-tax charge related to a European business unit, gross margins would have been 31.4 percent and operating profit margins would have been 14.8 percent. 3
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) - - Second quarter 2003 gross margins and operating margins were adversely affected by: - Increased energy, insurance and pension costs; - Higher promotion and display costs; - Weather conditions in certain markets; - Higher foreign currencies resulting in increased international sales which have lower margins; - Product mix and relatively higher sales in product segments with somewhat lower margins; and - Recently acquired companies with lower operating margins. - - SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 16.7 percent compared with 16.0 percent in the 2002 second quarter, reflecting increased promotional selling expenses and increased pension and insurance costs. - - General corporate expense was 1.0 percent of sales in the second quarter of both 2003 and 2002. - - Inventory days were 58 days at June 30, 2003 compared with 60 days at June 30, 2002. - - Accounts receivable days at the end of the second quarter were 53 days compared with 57 days a year ago. - - Accounts payable days at the end of the second quarter improved to 32 days from 26 days a year ago, as we continue to negotiate more favorable supplier terms. - - Working capital at June 30, 2003 (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) improved to 22.0 percent of the last twelve months of sales from 23.4 percent a year earlier. 4
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) - - For the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, operating profit return on net operating assets, (as reconciled) declined to 16.9 percent for the 2003 second quarter compared with 17.6 percent for the comparable period through June 30, 2002, reflecting acquisitions in the second half of 2002. - - For the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, return on invested capital (as reconciled) increased to 11.1 percent compared to 10.8 percent for the comparable period through June 30, 2002. - - The Company's tax rate was 34.8 percent in the second quarter of 2003 compared with 34.0 percent for the comparable period of the prior year. The rate increase is principally the result of recent acquisitions increasing the proportion of domestic income, which is generally taxed at higher rates than foreign income. The Company anticipates that its tax rate for all of 2003 will approximate 35 percent. - - At the end of the quarter, the Company had a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $2 billion in unused bank lines. - - Debt as a percent of total capitalization was 47 percent at both June 30, 2003 and March 31, 2003. - - The Company repurchased approximately nine million common shares during the second quarter of 2003. Through June 30, approximately 23 million shares have been repurchased in 2003, including approximately 2 million shares for long-term incentive compensation plans. The Company currently has approximately 28 million shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization. - - The Company announced its Board of Directors' intent to increase the quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter by 14 percent (a larger percentage increase than in recent years) from $.14 to $.16 per common share. The new quarterly dividend reflects the Company's favorable long-term outlook, strong balance sheet and cash flow and recent tax law changes, and would make this the 45th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. - - As previously announced, beginning January 1, 2003, the Company began expensing stock options on a prospective basis. 5
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 (CONCLUDED) - - The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 498.5 million (519.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003). Average diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter, taking into account the reduction for shares repurchased and not included as a reduction in the quarter would have been approximately 494 million. Contingently issuable shares, related to share price guarantees, utilized in the calculation of earnings per common share in the second quarter were based on a quarter-end average share price of $24.19. Such contingently issuable shares declined from 19.6 million shares at March 31, 2003 to 7.8 million shares at June 30, 2003. - - During the quarter, the Company completed the sale of its 42 percent equity interest in Emco Limited for cash proceeds of approximately $75 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million. - - In early July, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent providing for the purchase by The Black & Decker Corporation of Masco's Baldwin Hardware and Weiser Lock businesses. Baldwin and Weiser had combined 2002 net sales of approximately $250 million. The transaction is expected to close late in 2003 and is subject to final negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement, necessary regulatory clearances and approval from the Boards of Directors of both Companies. The Company expects to realize a gain on this transaction. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK - - The Company currently expects the second half of 2003 to be even stronger than the first half. If present positive sales and economic trends continue, the Company believes that third quarter earnings per common share should approximate a record $.48 to $.51 and continues to expect to achieve record sales and earnings for 2003 with full-year earnings in a range of $1.68 to $1.72 per common share, modestly higher than the Company's previous guidance. Statements contained herein may include certain forward-looking statements regarding Masco's future sales, earnings growth potential and other developments. Actual results may vary materially because of external factors such as interest rate fluctuations, changes in consumer spending and other factors over which management has no control.

MASCO CORPORATION - 2ND QUARTER 2003
MASCO CORPORATION CONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME 2003 AND 2002 - BY QUARTER (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) NOTES: - - In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $23 million ($.03 per common share, after tax) related to a business system failure at a European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment. The charge resulted from system failures at the unit and the unit managements' inadequate response to these failures during efforts to convert to a new business system in 2001 and 2002. The failures primarily impacted accurate recognition of cost of sales associated with over 20,000 sku's at the business unit with a corresponding misstatement of certain balance sheet accounts. - - Due to the unexpected passing of the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, certain benefits were accelerated and expensed in the first quarter of 2003.
