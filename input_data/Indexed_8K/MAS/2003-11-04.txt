EXHIBIT INDEX 99 Press Release of Masco Corporation, dated November 4, 2003, reporting Masco Corporation's financial results for the third quarter of 2003 and certain other information.

EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: - --------------------- Samuel Cypert 313-792-6646 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS AND UPDATES FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE Taylor, Michigan (November 4, 2003) -- Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) today reported that net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, aided by acquisitions, increased 19 percent to a record $2.9 billion, compared with $2.4 billion for the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the quarter increased to $318.8 million compared with $122.8 million for the 2002 third quarter. Earnings per common share increased to $.65 compared with $.24 per common share for the 2002 third quarter. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $261.5 million compared with $116.7 million in 2002. Earnings from continuing operations increased to a record $.53 per common share compared with $.22 per common share for the 2002 third quarter. Third quarter 2002 results included a charge of $166 million ($.20 per common share, after tax) related to the Company's subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, class action litigation. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $.53 per common share included the negative impact of accounting irregularities and impairment charges related to two businesses in the United Kingdom aggregating $.06 per common share, and the exclusion of $.01 per common share related to the third quarter 2003 operating results of businesses divested in the third quarter which are included in income from discontinued operations. These items were offset by an adjustment of the Behr litigation accrual of $.07 per common share. The $.53 per common share is consistent with the Company's previous guidance that earnings would be modestly above a range of $.48-$.51 per common share which included operating results of the divested businesses. As previously announced, the Company completed the sale of its Baldwin Hardware, Weiser Lock and Marvel Group businesses in the third quarter of 2003. Under accounting rules, the Company is required to treat these businesses as discontinued operations, accordingly their operating results are retroactively excluded from the Company's consolidated statements of income from continuing operations. Third quarter results include a pre-tax gain from the sale of these businesses, aggregating approximately $91 million ($.11 per common share, after tax) and income from their results of operations of approximately $6 million ($.01 per common share, after tax), both of which are included in discontinued operations.
Masco Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian commented, "The positive sales and economic trends that we experienced in our businesses in the third quarter of 2003 have continued thus far in the fourth quarter. Assuming that present business conditions continue for the remainder of the current quarter, seasonally one of the year's lowest quarters for Masco, we expect to achieve record sales and earnings in 2003 and we believe that our full-year 2003 earnings from continuing operations should be in the range of $1.68 to $1.70 per common share." This new guidance represents an increase from the Company's previous guidance of $1.68 to $1.72 per common share, when adjusted to exclude the projected operating results of $.04 per common share related to Baldwin, Weiser and Marvel for the entire year which had been included in the previous guidance, and also excludes any possible fourth quarter unusual charges. Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products. A conference call regarding the Company's third quarter 2003 sales and earnings is scheduled for Tuesday, November 4, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. ET. Participants in the call are asked to register five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time by dialing (719) 457-2667 (confirmation #236086).

A replay of the call will be available on Masco's website or by phone by dialing (719) 457-0820 (replay access code #236086) approximately two hours after the end of the call and will continue through November 10, 2003.

MASCO CORPORATION ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS Amounts are in thousands, except per share data.
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. See the attached tables for supplemental financial data and the corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, as well as for the year 2002. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. THIRD QUARTER 2003 o Net sales, aided by acquisitions, were a record $2.9 billion, increasing 19 percent over 2002 third quarter sales, with North American sales increasing 16 percent and International sales increasing 36 percent. Stronger sales to retail customers, sales of acquired companies (particularly Service Partners in our Installation Group and Hansgrohe AG in our International Plumbing Products Group) and the favorable impact of foreign currencies contributed to the sales growth in the third quarter. o Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, third quarter 2003 net sales increased 10 percent compared with third quarter 2002 sales; North American net sales increased 10 percent and International sales increased 11 percent. In local currencies, International sales, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, were flat compared with the third quarter of 2002. 1
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) o The Company reported net income of $318.8 million or $.65 per common share. Included in the $.65 per common share is $.12 per common share related to discontinued operations, reflecting $.01 per common share related to the third quarter 2003 operating results of the businesses divested in the quarter and a gain of $.11 per common share from such divestitures. o The Company reported income from continuing operations of $261.5 million or $.53 per common share. The $.53 per common share included the negative impact of accounting irregularities and impairment charges related to two businesses in the United Kingdom aggregating $.06 per common share, and the exclusion of $.01 per common share related to the third quarter 2003 operating results of businesses divested in the third quarter which are included in income from discontinued operations. These items were offset by an adjustment of the Behr litigation accrual of $.07 per common share. The $.53 per common share is consistent with the Company's previous guidance that earnings would be modestly above a range of $.48-$.51 per common share which included the operating results of the divested businesses. o In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax charge which reduced operating profit by approximately $23 million ($.03 per common share, after tax) with respect to a United Kingdom business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment. The Company's recently completed review determined that an additional $12 million ($.02 per common share, after tax) of charges related to 2002, resulting from accounting irregularities, should be recorded in the third quarter of 2003. In addition, the review disclosed that first half 2003 results were overstated by approximately $3 million. These overstatements were corrected in the third quarter of 2003. This analysis concluded that the previously disclosed business system implementation failure allowed former management to circumvent internal controls and artificially inflate the unit's operating profit. The Company also determined that goodwill related to this business unit was impaired and recorded a pre-tax charge of $5 million ($.01 per common share, after tax). As previously noted, the Company replaced management personnel at the business unit and has implemented corrective action to prevent this situation from occurring at the unit in the future. In addition, the Company completed a review of the business plan for the business unit with the new management team and has determined that the plan, relative to certain product offerings and customer focus, should be changed. This revision in operating strategy resulted in third quarter 2003 charges aggregating approximately $15 million ($.02 per common share, after tax) related to impairment of inventories and receivables. 2
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) In the third quarter of 2003, the Company also detected that an employee at a United Kingdom business unit in the Plumbing Products segment had circumvented internal controls and overstated operating results by approximately $4 million ($.01 per common share, after tax) in 2002 and by approximately $3 million in the first half of 2003. These overstatements were corrected in the third quarter of 2003. The Company made the appropriate personnel change and is continuing to review the operation and its internal controls to determine if any additional changes are required. Upon completion of the review, the Company will determine if any impairment of assets exist, including goodwill (approximately $28 million at September 30, 2003). o The Company is implementing changes to its operational and financial structure in Europe which include: reorganizing its European business operations into product groups; the addition of group operating and financial personnel; training and evaluation related to internal controls; and the expansion of both external and internal audit involvement. o During the quarter, the Company completed the sale of its Baldwin Hardware and Weiser Lock businesses to The Black & Decker Corporation. Baldwin and Weiser had combined 2002 net sales of approximately $250 million. In a separate transaction, the Company also completed the sale of its Marvel Group. Total proceeds from the sale of these companies were $289 million, including cash of $284 million and notes receivable of $5 million. The Company realized a pre-tax net gain of $90.5 million ($.11 per common share, after tax) from the sale of these businesses. Under accounting rules, the Company is required to account for these businesses as discontinued operations; accordingly, their historic operating results (and the net gain from the sale of these businesses) are retroactively excluded from the Company's continuing operations. 3
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) o In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded income of $57.6 million ($.07 per common share, after tax) related to an adjustment of the Behr litigation accrual. The filing deadline for claims related to the National Settlement was September 2, 2003, and the Company received a fraction (3,700) of the previously projected claims (180,000) and currently estimates the cost of such claims to approximate $8 million compared with the $66 million originally recorded by the Company in the third quarter of 2002. o Key retailer sales (excluding discontinued operations) in the third quarter of 2003 increased eight percent, compared with a seven percent increase in the second quarter of 2003 and a five percent increase in the 2003 first quarter. Combined sales to Home Depot, Lowe's and Wal-Mart also increased by approximately eight percent in the 2003 third quarter compared with the six percent increase in the second quarter of 2003 and a four percent increase in the first quarter of 2003. o Sales by segment in the 2003 third quarter versus the 2002 third quarter were: - Cabinets and Related Products sales were up nine percent; - Plumbing Products sales were up 28 percent; - Installation and Other Services sales were up 31 percent; - Decorative Architectural Products sales were up 17 percent; and - Other Specialty Products sales were up 13 percent. Particularly strong sales in the quarter included assembled cabinets, installed sales of non-insulation products, paints and stains, and vinyl windows. o Gross margins were 30.9 percent in the 2003 third quarter compared with 31.9 percent in 2002. o Operating profit margins increased to 16.4 percent compared with 10.0 percent in the third quarter of 2002. 4
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) o Operating profit margins for the third quarter of 2003 include the effect of the previously discussed charges related to certain United Kingdom business units of $42 million, which are more than offset by the Behr litigation accrual adjustment of $57.6 million. Operating profit margins for the third quarter of 2002 included a Behr litigation charge of $166 million. Operating profit margins excluding these items would have been 15.9 percent and 16.8 percent for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, respectively. o Third quarter 2003 gross margins and operating margins continue to be adversely affected by: - Increased energy, insurance and pension costs; - Higher promotion and display costs; - Stronger foreign currencies resulting in increased International sales which have lower margins; - Product mix and relatively higher sales in product segments with somewhat lower margins; and - Recently acquired companies with lower operating margins. o SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 16.5 percent compared with 15.1 percent in the 2002 third quarter, reflecting increased promotion and selling expenses and adjustments related to the United Kingdom operations previously discussed. o General corporate expense was 1.0 percent of sales in the third quarter of both 2003 and 2002. o Inventory days were 49 days at September 30, 2003 compared with 58 days at September 30, 2002. o Accounts receivable days at the end of the third quarter were 53 days compared with 57 days a year ago. o Accounts payable days at the end of the third quarter improved to 38 days from 32 days a year ago, as we continue to negotiate more favorable supplier terms. 5
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONTINUED) o Working capital at September 30, 2003 (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) improved to 20.5 percent of the last twelve months of sales from 24.5 percent a year earlier. o For the twelve months ended September 30, 2003, operating profit return on net operating assets (as reconciled) declined to 16.0 percent compared with 16.3 percent for the comparable period through September 30, 2002, reflecting acquisitions in the second half of 2002. o For the twelve months ended September 30, 2003, after tax return on invested capital (as reconciled) increased to 10.7 percent compared with 10.3 percent for the comparable period through September 30, 2002. o The Company's tax rate for continuing operations was 37.0 percent in the third quarter of 2003 compared with 31.1 percent for the comparable period of the prior year. Excluding the charge for litigation settlement, the Company's 2002 third quarter tax rate was 34.1 percent. The rate increase reflects an increase in the proportion of domestic income (which is taxed at a higher effective tax rate than foreign income) as a result of the impact of recent acquisitions and charges related to the United Kingdom operations mentioned previously. The Company anticipates that its tax rate for the full year 2003 will approximate 36 percent. Based on current estimates, the Company expects its effective tax rate for 2004 will approximate 35 percent. o At the end of the quarter, the Company had a strong balance sheet, with cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.2 billion and $2 billion in unused bank lines. o During the third quarter of 2003, the Company retired approximately $300 million of its outstanding debt. Debt as a percent of total capitalization was 45 percent at September 30, 2003 and 47 percent at both June 30, 2003 and March 31, 2003. The Company has retired an additional $100 million of its debt thus far in the fourth quarter of 2003. o The Company repurchased approximately 5 million common shares during the third quarter of 2003. Through September 30, approximately 28 million common shares have been repurchased in 2003, including approximately 2 million common shares for long-term incentive compensation plans. The Company currently has approximately 22 million common shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization. 6
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS THIRD QUARTER 2003 (CONCLUDED) o The Company increased the quarterly dividend for the 2003 fourth quarter by 14 percent (a larger percentage increase than in recent years) from $.14 to $.16 per common share. The new quarterly dividend reflects the Company's favorable long-term outlook, strong balance sheet and cash flow and recent tax law changes, and makes this the 45th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. o As previously announced, beginning January 1, 2003, the Company began expensing stock options on a prospective basis. o The weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the quarter were 489.1 million (498.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and 519.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003). Average diluted common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter, taking into account the reduction for shares repurchased and not included as a reduction in the quarter, would have been approximately 486 million. Contingently issuable common shares, related to share price guarantees, utilized in the calculation of earnings per common share in the third quarter were based on a quarter-end average share price of $24.51. Such contingently issuable common shares declined from 7.8 million shares at June 30, 2003 to 5.6 million common shares at September 30, 2003. o Yesterday the Company announced that its Board of Directors has appointed two new Directors: Professor David L. Johnston, 62, has served as President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada since July 1, 1999. A specialist in securities regulation, corporation and information technology law, Professor Johnston has authored numerous books, holds an A.B. from Harvard University, an L.L.B. from Cambridge University and an L.L.B. from Queen's University, as well as honorary doctorates from twelve universities. J. Michael Losh, 57, formerly served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of General Motors from July 1994 through August 2000 and as chairman of GMAC, General Motor's financial services group, from July 1994 until April 1999. Additional information is available on the Company's website. FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK o If present sales and economic trends continue, the Company believes that it will achieve record sales and earnings for 2003. The Company expects that full-year 2003 earnings from continuing operations should be in the range of $1.68 to $1.70 per common share, excluding any possible unusual fourth quarter items. This new guidance represents an increase from the Company's previous guidance of $1.68 to $1.72 per common share when adjusted to exclude the projected operating results of $.04 per common share related to the Company's discontinued operations (Baldwin, Weiser and Marvel) for the entire year which had been included in the previous guidance. o The Company estimates that fourth quarter earnings per common share will be in the range of $.38-$.40 per common share, excluding any possible unusual items. Statements contained herein may include certain forward-looking statements regarding Masco's future sales, earnings growth potential and other developments. Actual results may vary materially because of external factors such as interest rate fluctuations, changes in consumer spending and other factors over which management has no control. Additional information about our products, markets and conditions, which could affect our future performance, is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on Masco's website at www.masco.com. Masco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 7
