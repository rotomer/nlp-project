EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NO.

EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: - --------------------- Samuel Cypert 313-792-6646 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS MASCO CORPORATION HIGHLIGHTS: FIRST QUARTER 2005 o Net sales from continuing operations increased six percent to a record $3.0 billion. o Income from continuing operations was $212 million or $.48 per common share. o The Company returned $545 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. o The quarterly dividend was increased by 11 percent, from $.18 to $.20 per common share, marking the 47th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. o The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock. o The Company had over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at March 31, 2005. Taylor, Michigan (May 3, 2005) -- Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 increased six percent to a first quarter record of $3.0 billion compared with $2.8 billion for the first quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 was $212 million or $.48 per common share compared with $241 million or $.52 per common share for the comparable period of 2004. Results for the first quarter of 2005 benefited from other income, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments, of $.06 per common share. In addition, first quarter 2005 results benefited from a reduction in the Company's tax rate of $.02 per common share, which offset currency translation losses of $.02 per common share. The first quarter of 2004 benefited from other income, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments, of $.07 per common share and income related to the Behr litigation of $.03 per common share. The Company previously announced, in the first quarter of 2004, the planned disposition of several European businesses that were not core to the Company's long-term growth strategy. First quarter 2004 results included an after-tax charge of $.16 per common
share to reflect those businesses expected to be divested at a loss. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed the disposition process with the additional sale of two of these businesses realizing an after-tax net gain of $.04 per common share. Including the results related to the European businesses disposed, which have been treated as discontinued operations, net income for the first quarter of 2005 increased to $231 million compared with $168 million for the 2004 first quarter; earnings increased to $.52 per common share for the first quarter of 2005 compared with $.36 per common share for the 2004 first quarter. The Company's 2005 first quarter results, seasonally the lowest of the year, were adversely affected by lower-than-expected consumer spending impacting certain of its products sold through retail markets, product mix, as well as recent increases in commodity, energy, and freight costs, much of which have not yet been recovered due to the lag in implementing selling price increases to customers. The Company expects these conditions to continue at least through the second quarter of 2005. If higher energy costs and recent trends indicating lower consumer confidence and the related slowing in sales of certain retail products continue, the Company believes that full-year results may be nearer to the low end of its previously provided earnings guidance range for continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.50 per common share. Based on current business trends, the Company anticipates that second quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations will be in a range of $.58 to $.62 per common share compared with second quarter 2004 earnings of $.65 per common share (which included $.04 per common share of previously disclosed other income, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments).

MASCO CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 3/31/05 AND 3/31/04
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," the Company has accounted for the 2004 dispositions of Jung Pumpen, The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group, and the 2005 dispositions of Gebhardt Consolidated and the GMU Group as discontinued operations. FIRST QUARTER 2005 o Net sales from continuing operations increased six percent with North American sales increasing six percent and International sales increasing five percent. In local currencies, International sales increased one percent compared with the first quarter of 2004. Quarterly comparisons are challenging since net sales from continuing operations increased a strong 19 percent in the first quarter of 2004 compared with 2003. o Sales in the new construction market of installed products, assembled cabinets, and windows were particularly strong in the quarter. o Retail sales of paints and stains, faucets and cabinets were lower-than-expected. o Key retailer sales from continuing operations decreased two percent in the 2005 first quarter compared with a strong 20 percent increase in the first quarter of 2004 compared with 2003. o Sales by segment in the 2005 first quarter versus the 2004 first quarter were: o Cabinets and Related Products sales increased eight percent; o Plumbing Products sales increased three percent; o Installation and Other Services sales increased ten percent; o Decorative Architectural Products sales were flat; and o Other Specialty Products sales increased seven percent. o Income from continuing operations was $212 million compared with $241 million for the first quarter of 2004. 1
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 (CONTINUED) o Earnings from continuing operations were $.48 per common share compared with the Company's guidance of $.44 to $.47 per common share and compared with $.52 per common share for the 2004 first quarter. o Results for the first quarter of 2005 benefited from other income of $.06 per common share, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments and tax benefits of $.02 per common share related to the adjustment of estimated tax accruals, principally for actual tax results of International operations, which offset realized currency translation losses of $.02 per common share. The first quarter of 2004 benefited from other income, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments, of $.07 per common share and income related to the Behr litigation of $.03 per common share. o The Company previously announced, in the first quarter of 2004, the planned disposition of several European businesses that were not core to the Company's long-term growth strategy. First quarter 2004 results included an after-tax charge of $.16 per common share to reflect those businesses expected to be divested at a loss. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed the disposition process with the additional sale of two of these businesses, Gebhardt Consolidated and the GMU Group, realizing an after-tax net gain of $.04 per common share. Including the results of the European businesses disposed, which have been treated as discontinued operations, net income for the first quarter of 2005 increased to $231 million compared with $168 million for the 2004 first quarter; earnings for the first quarter of 2005 increased to $.52 per common share compared with $.36 per common share for the 2004 first quarter. Total net proceeds for the dispositions completed in 2004 and 2005 aggregated $282 million. o First quarter 2005 results were adversely affected by lower-than-expected consumer spending impacting certain of the Company's products sold through retail markets, product mix, as well as recent increases in commodity, energy, and freight costs, much of which have not yet been recovered due to the lag in implementing selling price increases to customers. 2
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 (CONTINUED) o Gross margins were 28.3 percent in the 2005 first quarter compared with 30.3 percent in the first quarter of 2004. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 11.6 percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared with 13.8 percent in the first quarter of 2004. Excluding the income regarding the litigation settlement of $2 million and $21 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, operating profit margins were 11.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared with 13.0 percent in the first quarter of 2004. Operating profit margins in the first quarter of 2005 were adversely impacted by increases in certain operating expenses, including increased commodity, energy, and freight costs, as well as lower-than-expected sales volume to the retail markets. o SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, including general corporate expense, were 16.8 percent in the first quarter 2005 compared with 17.3 percent in the 2004 first quarter. o General corporate expense was 1.5 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2005 compared with 1.3 percent in the comparable period of 2004. o Inventory days were 50 days at March 31, 2005 compared with 49 days at March 31, 2004. o Accounts receivable days at the end of the first quarter were 51 days compared with 53 days a year ago. o Accounts payable days at the end of the first quarter improved to 37 days from 36 days a year ago, as the Company continues to negotiate more favorable supplier terms. o Working capital at March 31, 2005 (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) improved to 18.0 percent of the last twelve months' sales from 18.5 percent a year earlier. o The Company's tax rate was 32.4 percent for the first quarter of 2005 compared with 36.3 percent for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in the tax rate was due to the adjustment of estimated tax accruals principally for actual tax results of International operations. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate for the full-year 2005 should approximate 35 percent. 3
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 (CONCLUDED) o At the end of the quarter, the Company had a strong balance sheet with over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $2 billion in unused bank lines. o In the first quarter of 2005, the Company generated approximately $69 million of cash from the net sale of financial investments and $63 million of net cash from the disposition of two European businesses. o Debt as a percent of total capitalization was 46 percent at March 31, 2005 compared with 47 percent at March 31, 2004. o For the twelve months ended March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, return on invested capital (as reported) was 11.6 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, return on invested capital (as reconciled) was 12.7 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively. The Company continues to believe that it will achieve its 15 percent return on invested capital goal by the end of 2006 and 18 percent by 2010. o During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 13 million common shares. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock, replacing the Company's previous authorization. The Company had approximately 47 million common shares remaining under the new repurchase authorization at March 31, 2005. o The Company's diluted common shares for purposes of calculating earnings per common share were 443 million for the first quarter of 2005 compared with 468 million for the first quarter of 2004. o During the quarter, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 11 percent, from $.18 to $.20 per common share, marking the 47th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. 4
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK o If higher energy costs and recent trends indicating lower consumer confidence and the related slowing in sales of certain retail products continue, the Company believes that full-year results may be nearer to the low end of its previously provided earnings guidance range for continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.50 per common share. o The Company's guidance is based on housing starts approximating 2004 levels, no additional share repurchases beyond the 13 million common shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2005, modest margin improvement in the second half of 2005, reflecting selling price increases offsetting rising commodity costs, and anticipated income from financial investments. The guidance also assumes no further significant commodity cost increases. o Based on current business trends, the Company anticipates that second quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations will be in a range of $.58 to $.62 per common share compared with second quarter 2004 earnings of $.65 per common share which included $.04 per common share of previously disclosed other income, principally net gains from the sale of financial investments. o The higher commodity costs experienced late in 2004 are continuing in 2005 and are having an adverse impact on first half results. The Company is continuing to implement additional price increases for a number of its products and believes that by the second half of 2005 most of these commodity cost increases should be largely offset. o The Company expects to return a minimum of $1 billion annually to shareholders, on average, over the next several years through share repurchases and dividends as part of its ongoing commitment to value creation. In 2004 and 2003, the Company returned $2.3 billion, in aggregate, to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company returned $545 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 5
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK (CONCLUDED) o Based on the current market price for the Company's common stock, diluted common shares for the computation of earnings per common share at April 1, 2005 are 437 million. This excludes the impact of any second quarter repurchases of common stock. Statements contained herein may include certain forward-looking statements regarding Masco's future sales, earnings growth potential and other developments. Actual results may vary materially because of external factors such as interest rate fluctuations, changes in consumer spending and other factors over which management has no control. The Company believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Additional information about our products, markets and conditions, which could affect our future performance, is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on Masco's website at www.masco.com. Masco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ### 6

MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF SALES GROWTH EXCLUDING EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS & CURRENCY TRANSLATION (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: The Company presents information comparing results from one period to another excluding the results of businesses acquired in order to assess the performance of the underlying businesses and to assess to what extent acquisitions are driving growth. The Company also presents information comparing results of International operations from one period to another using constant exchange rates. To present this information, current period results for foreign entities are converted into U.S. dollars using the prior period's exchange rates, rather than exchange rates for the current period. The Company presents this information in order to assess how the underlying businesses performed in local currencies before taking into account currency fluctuations. Page 10
MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT AND MARGINS (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) NOTE: The Company believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Page 11
MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: Data excludes discontinued operations. The Company believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This information is provided to explain the calculation of return on invested capital ("ROIC") which is calculated as after-tax operating profit (last twelve months) divided by the total of average debt (net of average cash) and average shareholders' equity. Page 12
MASCO CORPORATION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: The unusual relationship between income tax benefit and income before income taxes (including the gain on the disposition of businesses) in 2005 results, from the gain requiring no current tax expense and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of the discontinued operations which are no longer expected to be incurred. The after-tax charge for the impairment of assets held for sale in the first quarter of 2004 was $76 million and includes $12 million for the expensing of deferred tax assets of the discontinued operations. The information for discontinued operations is for the period prior to the respective dates of disposition. Page 13
