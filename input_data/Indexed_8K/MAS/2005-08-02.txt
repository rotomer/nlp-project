FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Maria Duey 313-792-5500 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS MASCO CORPORATION HIGHLIGHTS: SECOND QUARTER 2005 - Net sales from continuing operations increased nine percent to a record $3.3 billion. - Income from continuing operations was $274 million or $.64 per common share. - The Company returned $229 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. - The Company issued $500 million of fixed-rate 4.80% notes due 2015 and had over $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2005. Taylor, Michigan (August 2, 2005) - Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased nine percent to a record $3.3 billion compared with $3.1 billion for the second quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 was $274 million or $.64 per common share compared with $294 million or $.65 per common share for the comparable period of 2004. Results for the second quarter of 2005 benefited from other income, principally net gains from financial investments, of $.04 per common share, partially offset by realized currency transaction losses of $.02 per common share. The second quarter of 2004 benefited from $.03 per common share of other income, principally net gains from financial investments and other non-operating assets, as well as $.01 per common share of income related to insurance proceeds from the Behr litigation settlement and $.01 per common share of realized currency transaction gains. The Company's 2005 first half results were adversely affected by increases in commodity, energy and freight costs, which have not been totally recovered due, in part, to the lag in implementing selling price increases to customers, as well as product mix. Second quarter 2005 sales and earnings, however, were better-than-expected due to the strong new construction market as well as an improvement in key retailer sales.
The Company previously announced, in the first quarter of 2004, the planned disposition of several European businesses that are not core to the Company's long-term growth strategy. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 did not include any net income (loss) related to discontinued operations, since the Company completed the disposition process in the first quarter of 2005. The second quarter of 2004 results include after-tax income from discontinued operations of $11 million, and an additional after-tax charge aggregating $44 million ($.10 per common share) for those businesses that were expected to be divested at a loss, both of which are included in discontinued operations. Including the operating results of these discontinued operations and the charge for certain of these businesses, net income for the 2004 second quarter was $261 million or $.58 per common share. The Company is committed to its strategy of value creation and continues to be focused on the simplification of its business model, cash flow generation, improvement in return on invested capital and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Consistent with this strategy, the Company is pursuing a variety of initiatives to offset cost increases and increase operating profit, including sourcing programs, the restructuring of certain of its businesses (including consolidations), manufacturing rationalization, headcount reductions and other profit improvement programs. As previously disclosed, the Company believes these initiatives will reduce annual costs by $200 million by the end of 2007. Costs and charges related to the acceleration of these profit improvement programs, when combined with recent additional energy-related and commodity cost increases and the adverse effect of changes in currency values, are expected to result in the Company's full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations being closer to $2.30 per common share than the previous guidance of approximately $2.40 per common share. Implementing these initiatives should improve the Company's earnings outlook for 2006 and beyond. Based on current business trends, the Company anticipates that third quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $.60 to $.64 per common share compared with third quarter 2004 earnings from continuing operations of $.64 per common share.

MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF SALES GROWTH EXCLUDING EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS & CURRENCY TRANSLATION (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: The Company presents information comparing results from one period to another excluding the results of businesses acquired in order to assess the performance of the underlying businesses and to assess to what extent acquisitions are driving growth. The Company also presents information comparing results of International operations from one period to another using constant exchange rates. To present this information, current period results for foreign entities are converted into U.S. dollars using the prior period's exchange rates, rather than exchange rates for the current period. The Company presents this information in order to assess how the underlying businesses performed in local currencies before taking into account currency fluctuations. Page 12
MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT AND MARGINS (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) NOTE: The Company believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Page 13
MASCO CORPORATION GAAP RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: Data exclude discontinued operations. The Company believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This information is provided as detail for the calculation of return on invested capital ("ROIC") which is calculated as after-tax operating profit (last twelve months, as reconciled) divided by the total of average debt (net of average cash) and average shareholders' equity. Page 14
MASCO CORPORATION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: The unusual relationship between income tax benefit and income before income taxes (including the gain on the disposition of businesses) for the six months ended June 30, 2005 results from the gain requiring no current tax expense and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of the discontinued operations which are no longer expected to be incurred. The after-tax charge for the impairment of assets held for sale was $76 million in the first quarter of 2004, including $12 million for the expensing of deferred tax assets of the discontinued operations, and $44 million in the second quarter of 2004. The information for discontinued operations is for the period prior to the respective dates of disposition. Page 15
