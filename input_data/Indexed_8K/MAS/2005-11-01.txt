ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On October 27, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the amendment of the Masco Corporation 1997 Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive Plan (the "1997 Plan") and existing options to non-employee directors under the 1997 Plan and the Masco Corporation 1991 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "1991 Plan") to provide that upon termination of service as a director (other than as a result of death, disability or retirement due to age), all then exercisable options will remain exercisable beyond the three-month period currently provided until the later of (i) the 15th day of the third month following the date at which the option would otherwise have terminated in connection with the termination of service, or (ii) December 31 of the calendar year in which the option would otherwise have terminated in connection with the termination of service. Future options granted to non-employee directors will provide that upon termination of service as a director (other than as a result of death, disability or retirement due to age), all then exercisable options will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the original option term or one year after death. Upon termination of service as a director by reason of disability, all options will become and remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the original option term or one year after death. Provisions in the 1997 Plan currently provide that upon termination of a director's service (i) as a result of death, options become and remain exercisable for a one-year period after death, and (ii) as a result of retirement due to age, options continue to become exercisable and remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the original option term or one year after death. These provisions remain unchanged by the amendments. The 1997 Plan and options to non-employee directors under the 1997 Plan and the 1991 Plan will also be amended to remove the Company's right to require the repayment of the after-tax value of any installment of an option that became exercisable and was exercised within the two-year period preceding a director's termination of service. Outstanding awards to all participants under the 1991 Plan will be amended to conform certain provisions to those in the Masco Corporation 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"). Specifically, conforming amendments will be made to provisions in outstanding options relating to voluntary termination of employment and termination of employment by reason of disability. The definition of "Change in Control" in the 1991 Plan, the 1997 Plan and all outstanding awards of options and restricted stock under such plans will also be amended to conform to the 2005 Plan.

EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Maria Duey 313-792-5500 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS MASCO CORPORATION HIGHLIGHTS: THIRD QUARTER 2005 - Net sales from continuing operations increased six percent to a record $3.4 billion. - Income from continuing operations was $262 million or $.61 per common share. - The Company returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. - The Company had over $1.5 billion in cash at September 30, 2005. Taylor, Michigan (November 1, 2005) - Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased six percent to a record $3.4 billion compared with $3.2 billion for the third quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 was $262 million or $.61 per common share compared with $289 million or $.64 per common share for the comparable period of 2004. Results for the third quarter of 2005 were reduced by $.08 per common share, net, reflecting: impairment charges for certain financial investments, charges for a discontinued product line and headcount reductions related to the Company's Plumbing Products segment, and currency transaction gains. Results for the third quarters of 2005 and 2004 benefited from other income of $.04 and $.01 per common share, respectively, principally net gains from financial investments. While third quarter 2005 sales and earnings benefited from the strong new construction market and certain selling price increases, the Company's third quarter results were adversely affected by recent additional increases in commodity, energy and freight costs, as well as product mix. The third quarter of 2004 results include income from discontinued operations of $.02 per common share, a net gain of $.21 per common share for those businesses sold in the third quarter of 2004 and an impairment charge of $.07 per common share for those businesses that were expected to be divested at a loss, all of which were included in discontinued operations.
Including the operating results of these discontinued operations and the charge for certain of these businesses, net income for the 2004 third quarter was $359 million or $.80 per common share. The third quarter of 2005 did not include any net income (loss) related to discontinued operations, since the Company completed the disposition process in the first quarter of 2005. The Company is committed to its strategy of value creation and continues to be focused on the simplification of its business model, cash flow generation, improvement in return on invested capital and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Consistent with this strategy, the Company is pursuing a variety of initiatives to offset cost increases and increase operating profit, including sourcing programs, the restructuring of certain of its businesses (including consolidations), manufacturing rationalization, headcount reductions and other profit improvement programs. As previously disclosed, the Company believes these initiatives, which began in early 2005, will reduce annual costs by $200 million by the end of 2007. While the Company may incur expenses and charges related to these programs, implementing these initiatives should improve the Company's earnings outlook for 2006 and beyond. The Company believes that higher energy costs and recent trends indicating lower consumer confidence and the related slowing in sales of certain retail products will continue. Given these factors, together with recent additional commodity cost increases, most of which are not expected to be offset by selling price increases until the first half of 2006, the Company believes, based on current business trends, that fourth quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $.48 to $.52 per common share and that full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.24 per common share compared with the Company's previous guidance of approximately $2.30 per common share. The Company's guidance excludes any additional costs associated with its profit improvement programs and any other items. Fourth quarter 2004 earnings from continuing operations were $.55 per common share excluding the impact of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $.31 per common share. Including the charge, reported earnings were $.23 per common share. Results for the fourth quarter of 2004 benefited from gains from the sale of financial investments of $.06 per common share, partially offset by an impairment charge of $.03 per common share, related to certain financial investments. Results also benefited by $.02 per common share from a reduction in the Company's tax rate related to the utilization of foreign tax credits generated in the fourth quarter on distributions of foreign earnings.
