EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: - --------------------- Maria C. Duey 313-792-5500 MASCO CORPORATION ANNOUNCES TWO DIVESTITURES AND DATE FOR EARNINGS RELEASE AND CONFERENCE CALL FOR 2005 FOURTH QUARTER Taylor, Michigan (January 11, 2006) -- Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) today announced that it has completed the divestiture of two operating companies, with combined annual sales of approximately $200 million, which manufacture and distribute cabinets, bathroom vanities, medicine cabinets, shower rods and caddies, and other bath accessories. "Masco is continuing our stated strategy of reviewing our business portfolio for potential consolidations or divestitures," Masco Corporation Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian commented. "As a result of this process, it was determined that these two businesses were not core to our long-term cabinet platform strategy." Both transactions were closed in late 2005, with proceeds totaling approximately $200 million in cash. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the net gain on these transactions, along with 2005 full-year and prior period operating results of these companies, will be reflected in discontinued operations. The reduction in 2005 full-year operating earnings will be approximately $.04 per common share. This effectively reduces the Company's annual 2005 guidance for continuing operations to $2.16 to $2.20 per common share, from the previously communicated guidance of $2.20 to $2.24 per common share. The Company, however, continues to believe that its fourth quarter 2005 earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of its previously communicated guidance of $.48 to $.52 per common share. The Company's guidance excludes any additional costs associated with its profit improvement programs and any other items. In addition, Masco announced today that it will hold a conference call regarding 2005 fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 14, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. ET. The conference call will be hosted by Masco Chairman and CEO Richard A. Manoogian. Participants in the call are asked to register five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time by dialing: (913) 981-4902 (confirmation #4758760). The 2005 fourth quarter supplemental material will be distributed prior to the conference call and will be available on the Company's website at www.masco.com.
The conference call will be webcast simultaneously and in its entirety through the Masco Corporation website. Shareholders, media representatives and others interested in Masco may participate in the webcast by registering through the Investor Relations section on the Company's website. A replay of the call will be available on Masco's website or by phone by dialing: (719) 457-0820 (replay access code #4758760). The replay will be available approximately two hours after the end of the call and continue through February 21, 2006.
