FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Maria Duey 313-792-5500 MASCO CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD SALES FOR 2005 MASCO CORPORATION 2005 HIGHLIGHTS: FULL-YEAR 2005 - Net sales from continuing operations increased seven percent to a record $12.6 billion. - Income from continuing operations was $2.19 per common share excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge and $2.03 per common share including the impairment charge. - Free cash flow before dividends exceeded $1 billion. - The Company returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases (31 million shares) and dividends. - The quarterly dividend was increased by 11 percent, the 47th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. - The Company had over $2 billion of cash and marketable securities at year-end. Taylor, Michigan (February 14, 2006) - Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased seven percent, primarily from organic growth, to a record $12.6 billion compared with $11.9 billion for 2004. Income from continuing operations was $941 million or $2.19 per common share, excluding the impact of the non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $69 million pertaining to certain European operations. Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $872 million or $2.03 per common share, including the impact of the goodwill impairment charge. Income from continuing operations was $1,053 million in 2004 or $2.31 per common share, excluding the impact of the non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $104 million. Income from continuing operations was $949 million or $2.08 per common share, including the impact of the goodwill impairment charge.
Results for the year ended December 31, 2005 benefited from the strong new construction market and certain selling price increases, which were more than offset by increases in commodity, energy and freight costs, as well as a less favorable product mix. Results for 2005 also benefited from net gains related to the Company's financial investments. Fourth quarter 2005 net sales from continuing operations increased six percent to over $3.1 billion compared with $3.0 billion in the 2004 fourth quarter. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $211 million or $.50 per common share, excluding the non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $69 million. Including such charge, income from continuing operations was $142 million or $.34 per common share. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $243 million or $.54 per common share, excluding the non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $104 million. Including such charge, income from continuing operations was $139 million or $.31 per common share. Results for the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited from net gains from the sale of financial investments and other assets of $.02 per common share offset by $.02 per common share from an adjustment of deferred taxes related to certain European operations. Results for the fourth quarter of 2004 benefited from net gains from the sale of financial investments of $.06 per common share partially offset by an impairment charge of $.03 per common share related to the Company's investment in Furniture Brands International common stock. Results for the 2004 fourth quarter also benefited from a reduction in the Company's tax rate related to the utilization of foreign tax credits generated in the 2004 fourth quarter on distributions of foreign earnings which benefited earnings by $.02 per common share. During the fourth quarter of 2005, pursuant to the Company's strategy of reviewing its business portfolio for potential consolidations and divestitures, the Company completed the sale of two additional businesses in the Cabinets and Related Products segment with combined annual sales of approximately $200 million for aggregate proceeds of approximately $200 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax net gain on the disposition of these businesses of $50 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations. Assuming no further significant commodity cost increases and excluding any additional costs associated with its cost reduction programs and any other items, the Company believes, based on current business trends, that it will achieve 2006 full-year earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.35 to $2.45 per common share. Including planned costs and charges related to plant closures and other profit improvement programs, which are presently expected to approximate $70 million pre-tax 2006, earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in a range of $2.24 to $2.34 per common share.

FOURTH QUARTER 2005 - - Net sales from continuing operations for the quarter increased six percent to $3.1 billion, primarily from organic growth, with North American sales increasing nine percent and International sales decreasing eight percent.

Key retailer sales from continuing operations increased five percent in the 2005 fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 and a two percent increase in the third quarter of 2005. The Company believes retail sales were negatively impacted by higher energy costs adversely affecting lower-income consumers and inventory adjustments by certain retail customers. - - Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $211 million (excluding a non-cash, after-tax charge of $69 million for goodwill impairment related to certain European businesses) compared with $243 million (excluding a non-cash, after-tax charge of $104 million for goodwill impairment related to certain European businesses) for the fourth quarter of 2004. Reported income from continuing operations, including the goodwill impairment charges, was $142 million and $139 million for the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. - - Excluding the charges for goodwill impairment in both periods, reported earnings from continuing operations were $.50 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with the Company's most recent guidance of $.48 to $.52 per common share, and $.54 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2004. 1
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOURTH QUARTER 2005 (CONTINUED) - - Including the charges for goodwill impairment in both periods, reported earnings from continuing operations were $.34 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $.31 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2004. - - Results for the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited from net gains from the sale of financial investments and other assets of $.02 per common share offset by $.02 per common share from an adjustment of deferred taxes related to certain European operations. Results for the fourth quarter of 2004 benefited from net gains from the sale of financial investments of $.06 per common share partially offset by an impairment charge of $.03 per common share related to the Company's investment in Furniture Brands International common stock. Results for the 2004 fourth quarter also benefited from a reduction in the Company's tax rate related to the utilization of foreign tax credits generated in the 2004 fourth quarter on distributions of foreign earnings which benefited earnings by $.02 per common share. - - Sales changes by segment, which were substantially all organic growth, in the 2005 fourth quarter versus the 2004 fourth quarter were: - Cabinets and Related Products sales increased six percent; - Plumbing Products sales increased four percent; - Installation and Other Services sales increased 11 percent; - Decorative Architectural Products sales declined one percent; and - Other Specialty Products sales increased seven percent. - - Sales in certain segments were negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies and in addition, inventory adjustments by certain retail customers (principally in the Decorative Architectural Products segment). 2
MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOURTH QUARTER 2005 (CONCLUDED) - - Gross margins were 27.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with 29.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating profit margins as reported were 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding non-cash, pre-tax charges for goodwill impairment of $69 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $112 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, operating profit margins were 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. - - Results for the fourth quarter of 2005 include the positive impact of higher sales volume, which was offset by the negative effect of previously communicated increases in a number of operating expenses, including such items as commodity, freight, energy and other petroleum-based product costs. - - SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, including general corporate expense, were 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. - - General corporate expense was 1.5 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with 2.0 percent in the comparable period of 2004. - - The reported tax rates on income from continuing operations of 46.8 percent and 43.3 percent for the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, principally reflect the impact of a lower tax benefit on the goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges in 2005 and 2004 and the adjustment of deferred taxes related to certain European operations in 2005 and the impact of the distribution of foreign earnings in 2004 the Company's tax rate was 35 percent in the fourth quarters of both 2005 and 2004. - - The Company's diluted common shares for purposes of calculating earnings per common share were 419 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with 451 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. 3

Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the net gain on these transactions, along with 2005 full-year and prior period operating results of these companies, is reflected in discontinued operations. The impact of including these businesses in discontinued operations is to reduce full-year results of continuing operations by $.05 per common share. 4

MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 2006 OUTLOOK - - Based on the current market price for the Company's common stock, diluted common shares for the computation of earnings per common share at January 1, 2006 are 418 million. This excludes the impact of any 2006 repurchases of common stock. - - The Company believes that it will achieve further organic sales growth in 2006, and, based on current business trends, believes that it will achieve full-year earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.35 to $2.45 per common share, including approximately $60 million of increased benefits to be realized in 2006 from our cost reduction programs. - - The Company's full-year guidance is based on housing starts declining five percent from 2005 levels, share repurchases of a minimum 20 million common shares, modest margin improvement reflecting selling price increases offsetting rising commodity costs and anticipated income from financial investments. The guidance also assumes no further significant commodity cost increases. - - The Company in January 2006 announced a planned plant closure in the Plumbing Products segment. The costs associated with the closure are expected to be incurred over the remainder of 2006. These costs and other costs and charges related to the Company's cost reduction initiatives are anticipated to aggregate approximately $70 million in 2006. Including this $70 million of anticipated costs (approximately $.11 per common share) guidance for earnings from continuing operations would be in a range of $2.24 to $2.34 per common share. - - While the Company will continue to provide annual guidance, it will no longer provide quarterly earnings guidance. 8
PROFIT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS --------------------------- - - The Company remains committed to its strategy of value creation and is focused on the simplification of its business model, cash flow generation, improvement in return on invested capital, and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Consistent with this strategy, the Company is pursuing a variety of initiatives to offset cost increases and increase operating profit, including sourcing programs, the restructuring of certain of its businesses including consolidations, manufacturing rationalization, headcount reductions, and other profit improvement programs. - - MAJOR PROGRAM COMPONENTS ------------------------ - Asian sourcing has grown from $200 million in 2003, $450 million in 2004 to in excess of our $550 million goal in 2005. We have previously indicated that we save 25-30% on items we outsource to Asia. - Consolidations, together with divestitures, have reduced our business units from 67 in early 2003 to less than 40 at December 31, 2005. - - PROGRAM COSTS ------------- We estimate that direct costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives approximated $30 million in 2005, and anticipate that direct costs will approximate $70 million (primarily related to manufacturing plant closures) or $.11 per common share in 2006. The quarterly timing of recording costs in 2006 will be driven by events over the course of the year. - - PROGRAM BENEFITS ---------------- We believe that we realized additional cost reduction benefits in 2005 of approximately $40 million. Additional cost reduction benefits in 2006 are expected to approximate $60 million. The Company expects to realize the full extent of the benefits from these initiatives in 2007 and beyond. Minimal additional costs related to implementing these programs are presently expected for 2007. - - We expect to provide further detail related to our cost reduction programs during our March 30, 2006 Investor Conference. 9

MASCO CORPORATION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IN MILLIONS) NOTES: The unusual relationship between income tax and loss before income taxes in 2004 (including the impairment charge for assets held for sale and the net gain on disposals) resulted primarily from the expected loss providing no current tax benefit and the reversal of deferred tax assets of the discontinued operations which were no longer expected to be realized. The after-tax charge for the impairment of assets held for sale of $151 million included $12 million for the expensing of deferred tax assets of the discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The information for discontinued operations is for the period prior to the respective dates of disposition. Page 16
