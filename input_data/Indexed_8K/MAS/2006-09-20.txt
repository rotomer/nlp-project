EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Maria Duey 313-792-5500 MASCO CORPORATION ANNOUNCES A REDUCTION IN ANTICIPATED EARNINGS FOR 2006 AS A RESULT OF THE ACCELERATED DECLINE IN HOUSING STARTS Taylor, Michigan (September 20, 2006) -- Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today announced lower earnings expectations for 2006. "A softening of incoming orders for building products and services in recent weeks, along with a forecasted deeper than expected decline in year-over-year single family housing starts for the last four months of 2006, currently projected to approximate twenty percent, are expected to result in the Company's third quarter sales being approximately flat, and fourth quarter sales being down low-to mid-single digits compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. Accordingly, full year earnings, excluding costs and charges related to profit improvement programs and any other items, may be closer to $2.25 to $2.30 per common share rather than our most recent guidance of the lower end of the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per common share," said Richard A. Manoogian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Masco Corporation. The Company will host a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. ET. Participants in the call are asked to register five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time by dialing (719) 457-2645 (confirmation #4017834).

A replay of the call will be available on Masco's website or by phone by dialing (719) 457-0820 (replay access code #4017834) approximately two hours after the end of the call and will continue through September 27, 2006.

MASCO CORPORATION BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS o At the beginning of August we indicated that our earnings, excluding costs and charges related to profit improvement programs and any other items, would be closer to the lower end of our guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per common share based on an increased forecasted decline for full-year housing starts of eight percent. o While August sales and earnings approximated our expectations, in September we have experienced a significant softening of incoming orders for building products and services. o Last week, a number of industry sources lowered their annual forecasts for housing starts to an approximate 12 percent decline from their previous July forecasts of an approximate eight percent decline. Based on actual housing starts for the first eight months of the year this would imply a decline of approximately 20 percent for the remaining four months of 2006. o As a result of this revised forecast and information we are receiving from our own customers, we are also forecasting an increased decline of at least 12 percent in housing starts for this year. We have previously stated that a one percent change in housing starts impacts our annual earnings per share by approximately two and a half cents. o Based on this change in forecast and given that we have also seen some modest softening in sales of larger ticket items on the consumer side of our business, we now anticipate that our third quarter sales will be approximately flat, and fourth quarter sales will be down approximately low- to mid-single digits as compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. Our full-year earnings, excluding costs and charges related to profit improvement programs and any other items, may approximate $2.25 to $2.30 per common share versus our most recent guidance of the lower end of the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per common share.
