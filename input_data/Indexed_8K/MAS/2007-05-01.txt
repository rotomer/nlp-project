99       Press Release of Masco Corporation dated May 1, 2007 reporting Masco Corporation's financial results for the first quarter of 2007 and certain other information and supplemental information prepared for use in connection with the financial results for the first quarter of 2007.

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     Taylor, Michigan (May 1, 2007)  Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 declined nine percent to $2.9 billion compared with $3.2 billion for the first quarter of 2006. North American sales declined 15 percent and International sales increased 21 percent. In local currencies, International sales increased 10 percent compared with the first quarter of 2006.
     Income from continuing operations was $142 million or $.37 per common share and $207 million or $.50 per common share in the first quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively. Results benefited from net gains of $.04 and $.01 per common share related to financial investments in the first quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     First quarter 2007 results, seasonally the lowest quarter of the year, were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services, assembled cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market and a continued moderation in consumer spending for certain "big ticket" home improvement items, such as cabinets, as well as a less favorable product mix and increased commodity costs. Results were aided by increased sales volume of paints and stains and increased sales from International operations, particularly plumbing products.
 
     As part of its profit improvement programs, the Company has been focused on the rationalization of its businesses, including sourcing programs, business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other initiatives. During the first quarters of 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred costs and charges of $25 million pre-tax ($.04 per common share, after tax) and $17 million pre-tax ($.03 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to profit improvement programs. Offsetting these charges in the first quarter of 2007 were lower stock-based compensation expense and gain on the sale of corporate fixed assets aggregating $12 million pre-tax ($.02 per common share, after tax) and the previously discussed income related to financial investments of $.04 per common share, after tax.
     While results in the first quarter of 2007 were substantially below the strong first quarter of 2006, reflecting a decline of approximately 30 percent in housing starts, sales and earnings were better than the Company anticipated when it issued its full-year 2007 earnings guidance in February. At that time, the Company anticipated that first quarter net sales would be down low-double digits, compared with the actual decline of nine percent.
     Economic conditions, however, remain uncertain in the Company's markets, and certain commodity costs, which had stabilized or declined, have recently increased once again. Housing starts have declined dramatically in the last 12 months due to previous excessive speculative buying, rapidly rising home prices in recent years reducing affordability and less attractive mortgage terms. Even with the recent decline in new home construction, the inventory of unsold new and existing homes has remained at unprecedented high levels. As a result, the Company has lowered its 2007 housing starts estimate to between approximately 1.4 million to 1.5 million. In addition, we continue to see a moderation in consumer spending for certain "big ticket" home improvement items, such as cabinets, and currently estimate that 2007 full-year sales will decline low-to-mid single digits compared with 2006.
     The Company believes that the negative impacts of its downward revision in estimated housing starts to a range of approximately 1.4 million to 1.5 million from approximately 1.5 million to 1.7 million, assumed in its original guidance given in February, and increased commodity costs will be largely offset by a combination of the stronger-than-expected first quarter results, the continued strength related to International operations, including the favorable effect of currency translation, share repurchases and the profit improvement programs we are pursuing. Accordingly, at this time the Company, assuming no further escalation in commodity costs, estimates that 2007 full-year earnings will approximate $1.50 to $1.70 per common share, instead of its original guidance of "$1.50 or less to $1.80 per common share or more." The above guidance includes approximately $60 million pre-tax ($.10 per common share, after tax) of costs related to plant start-up, severance, systems implementations and plant closures.
     Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
