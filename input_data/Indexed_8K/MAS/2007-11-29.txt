Mr. Barry, who first joined Masco in 1972 as a controller in one of the Company's operating divisions, rose through the ranks to eventually lead corporate-wide global operations. Richard Manoogian, Executive Chairman stated: "We have been fortunate, for over 35 years, to have the benefit of Alan's vision, operational skills and total dedication to Masco. He has spearheaded much of Masco's strategic direction in recent years and has made significant contributions to our growth and success. He has been the driver of our emphasis on developing new innovative products, and we will benefit from his efforts for years to come."
Timothy Wadhams added, "Masco's leadership transition during the past year has been seamless, in large part, due to Alan's guidance and insight. He has had a close working relationship with Donny DeMarie for over 12 years, and Alan's coaching and mentoring have helped position Donny for his new responsibilities. Donny and I are both grateful to Alan for his commitment to our personal development. His leadership in implementing Masco's strategic focus on rationalizing our portfolio of operating divisions, streamlining our operations, reducing costs, developing growth strategies and increasing profits and returns to generate greater value for our shareholders is greatly appreciated."
