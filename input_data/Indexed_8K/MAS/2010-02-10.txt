2009 Fourth Quarter Trends
     
2009 Full-Year Highlights
Taylor, Mich., (February 10, 2010)  Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined 18 percent to $7.8 billion from $9.5 billion for 2008. North American sales declined 18 percent and International sales declined 17 percent. In local currencies, International sales declined ten percent compared with 2008.
Income from continuing operations was $.11 per common share and $.20 per common share for 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. Including these charges, the loss from continuing operations, as reported, was ($140) million or ($.41) per common share and ($366) million or ($1.06) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
"We are very encouraged by our 2009 financial and operating performance in one of the more difficult economic environments Masco has ever experienced. Although our sales were down 18 percent, compared to 2008, we were able to offset a significant portion of our volume declines, primarily as a result of innovative new product introductions and market share gains," said Masco's CEO Tim Wadhams. "Obviously, forecasting business conditions and Company performance was extremely challenging in 2009, but having said that, we continued to exceed our expectations for sales, operating profit and cash flow as the year progressed. Ending the year with over $1.4 billion of cash is a testament to the world-wide Masco Team's dedication and commitment to our emphasis on cash generation. We are very proud of their accomplishments," added Wadhams.
Results for 2009 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of new home construction products and services, as well as a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products in both North American and International markets. The negative market conditions were partially offset by increased sales volume of paints and stains, market share gains, the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives.
We continue to focus on the rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system implementations and other initiatives. During 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs and charges of $94 million pre-tax ($.17 per common share, after tax) and $78 million pre-tax ($.14 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to these initiatives.
During 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill (in the fourth quarter) aggregating $262 million ($.51 per common share, after tax), non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for financial investments aggregating $10 million ($.02 per common share, after tax) and pre-tax currency transaction gains of $17 million ($.03 per common share, after tax). During 2008, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets (in the fourth quarter) aggregating $467 million ($1.26 per common share, after tax), non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for financial investments aggregating $58 million ($.10 per common share, after tax) and pre-tax currency transaction losses of $29 million ($.05 per common share, after tax).
Fourth Quarter 2009
Fourth quarter 2009 net sales from continuing operations declined three percent to $1.9 billion compared with $2.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2008. North American sales declined seven percent and International sales increased 12 percent. In local currencies, International sales increased one percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.
Income (loss) from continuing operations was $.02 per common share and ($.17) per common share for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. Including these charges, loss from continuing operations, as reported, was ($173) million or ($.49) per common share and ($504) million or ($1.44) per common share for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
During the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs and charges of $27 million pre-tax ($.05 per common share, after tax) and $39 million pre-tax ($.07 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to the rationalization of our businesses. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for financial investments of $28 million ($.05 per common share, after tax).
"Although new home construction and big-ticket remodeling activity continues to be depressed, our other product groups experienced relatively solid top-line repair and remodel sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2009 is the first quarter in a long time where sales to key retailers and operating profit, adjusted for impairment charges, exceeded the prior year quarter. We are encouraged by these positive trends, and we continue to increase market share in key segments as we move into 2010," said Tim Wadhams.
2010 Outlook
We expect that business conditions in 2010 will improve compared to 2009. While we are concerned about the impact of current unemployment levels, foreclosure activity and access to financing, we believe that housing starts will improve in 2010 and will increase to a range of 600,000 to 700,000 units.
While we anticipate that expenditures on repair and remodel activity will improve modestly in 2010 from 2009 levels, we believe that big-ticket items will continue to be deferred, in the short-term, until general economic conditions, credit availability and home prices improve.
We are confident that the long-term fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets are positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands (including: KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint and Milgard windows), our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.
Beginning with 2010, Masco will no longer provide definitive earnings per common share and cash flow guidance. Instead, we will provide additional segment detail, along with estimates of key financial data.
Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
