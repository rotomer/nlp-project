2010 Second Quarter Commentary
Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 increased two percent to $2.0 billion. North American sales and International sales each increased two percent. In local currencies, International sales increased eight percent compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Taylor, Mich., (July 26, 2010) 
The second quarter of 2010 results were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products, windows and paints and stains, and a more favorable product mix of paints and stains. Second quarter 2010 results were also positively affected by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of cabinets and the negative impact of a competitive pricing environment.
Income from continuing operations, as reported, was $.01 per common share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to income from continuing operations of $.19 per common share in the second quarter of 2009.
 
We continue to focus on the rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system implementations and other initiatives. During the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, we incurred costs and charges of $51 million pre-tax ($.09 per common share, after tax) and $22 million pre-tax ($.04 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to these initiatives.
During the second quarter of 2010, we also recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for financial investments aggregating $33 million ($.06 per common share, after tax). During the second quarter of 2009, we recognized non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for financial investments aggregating $7 million ($.01 per common share, after tax).
"We had a solid second quarter in terms of operating performance," said Masco's CEO Tim Wadhams. "If we exclude charges for business rationalizations and financial assets, and normalize our tax rate at 36 percent, many of our key measures show nice improvement compared to second quarter of 2009. Gross margins and operating margins would have exceeded 28 percent and eight percent, respectively, the highest levels achieved on an adjusted basis, since 2008. In addition, EPS for second quarter of 2010, adjusted for the items above, would have approximated $.16 per common share. Second quarter of 2010 also includes additional interest expense and a change in currency transaction impact from gains to losses which, in aggregate, reduced earnings by $.05 per common share compared to second quarter of 2009. Innovative new products drove market share gains and we continued to drive strong incremental margins in the quarter. We are proud of the Masco Team, worldwide, as we continue to focus on strengthening our leadership brands and enhancing customer experience with our products and services through innovation and quality while continuing to drive lean principles to improve our execution," said Tim Wadhams.
We retired $59 million of 5.875 percent debt due 2012 that was purchased in open-market transactions.
Outlook 2010
"After a relatively slow start to the year, we were encouraged that March and April 2010 sales were up high single digits compared to 2009. Since then, economic activity related to our markets, particularly consumer spending and new home building has slowed and our business has slowed," said Tim Wadhams.
Although we continue to be concerned about foreclosure activity and access to financing, we believe that housing starts will improve in 2010 from 554,000 units in 2009, but currently believe that the increase will be in a range of 575,000 to 625,000 units. This is a reduction of our previous expectation that 2010 housing starts would increase to a range of 600,000 to 700,000 units. In addition, we anticipate that expenditures on repair and remodel activity will be challenged in the second half of 2010 and expect that big-ticket items will continue to be deferred, in the short-term, until general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer confidence, credit availability and home prices improve.
 
We are confident that the long-term fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets are positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands (including: KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint and Milgard windows), our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.
Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
