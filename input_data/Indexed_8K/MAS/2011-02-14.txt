2010 Full-Year Commentary
Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased three percent to $7.6 billion. North American sales decreased three percent and International sales were flat. In local currencies, International sales increased five percent compared with 2009.
Taylor, Mich., (February 14, 2011) 
Income from continuing operations was $.16 per common share and $.31 per common share for 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding the items in Exhibit A and with a normalized tax rate of 36 percent. Including these items, loss from continuing operations, as reported was $(3.00) per common share and $(.41) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
"Industry conditions in 2010 continued to be challenging and it was a tough year for Masco. In many ways 2010 was a tale of two halves. We came out of 2009 with good momentum and our sales in the first half of 2010 were up two percent. As the year progressed, the expiration of the home buyer tax credit, increasing commodity costs and the competitive environment made the second half of 2010 much more challenging and our sales were down seven percent compared to second half 2009. Our installation and cabinet businesses, which are tied to new home construction and "big ticket" repair and remodel activity, were particularly hard hit. We are encouraged that in a difficult environment, our full-year adjusted gross margins (26.4 percent) and operating profit (5.7 percent) were essentially flat with 2009 even though sales were down three percent. We accomplished a lot in 2010 as we focused on strengthening our brands and improving our execution. We continued to implement the Masco Business System (MBS) across the enterprise, introduced innovative new products
 
including Delta  Touch0  faucets, Arrow  RED  line of staplers, and Kilz  Pro-X paint, and enhanced our financial flexibility, ending the year with $1.7 billion of cash," said Masco's CEO Tim Wadhams.

We continue to focus on the rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system implementations and other initiatives. During 2010 and 2009, we incurred costs and charges of $208 million pre-tax ($.38 per common share, after tax) and $94 million pre-tax ($.17 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to these initiatives.
In 2010, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets and deferred tax assets valuation allowance aggregating $1,092 million ($2.76 per common share, after tax). The impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets is primarily related to our Installation and Other Services segment and reflects our expectation that the recovery in new home construction will be modestly slower than previously anticipated. The charge for deferred tax assets valuation allowance reflects accounting guidance that requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets because we are in a three-year cumulative loss position, due to U.S. operating losses and the U.S. goodwill impairment charge, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010. These losses negated our ability to utilize our previously identified tax planning strategy. During 2009, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge for goodwill (in the fourth quarter) of $262 million ($.51 per common share, after tax).
We recently successfully amended our revolving credit facility to reflect the impact of our impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets and the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets on our net worth; we continue to have borrowing capacity of approximately $1 billion available under the revolving credit facility.
Fourth Quarter 2010
2010 Fourth Quarter Commentary
Fourth quarter 2010 net sales from continuing operations decreased nine percent to $1.7 billion compared with $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. North American sales decreased nine percent and International sales decreased seven percent. In local currencies, International sales were flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
(Loss) income from continuing operations was $(.08) per common share and $.05 per common share, for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding the items in Exhibit B and with a normalized tax rate of 36 percent. Including these items, loss from continuing operations, as reported, was $(2.96) per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $(.49) per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, we incurred business rationalization costs and charges of $104 million pre-tax ($.19 per common share, after tax; this includes a non-cash, pre-tax charge of $67 million related to a fourth quarter 2010 decision to close a cabinet facility that had previously been idled) and $27 million pre-tax ($.05 per common share, after tax), respectively.
 
Outlook 2011
"The trends impacting our business including depressed new home construction, the deferral of "big ticket" repair and remodel activity and commodity cost pressures have continued into early 2011. We expect a challenging business environment, particularly in the first half of 2011; we expect the second half of 2011 to be stronger. The MBS continues to drive positive change across Masco: although we are incurring short-term costs, our Cabinet integration is on plan and we expect will ultimately drive fixed cost reductions and share gains; we have strengthened our brands, our focus on innovation is driving new opportunities and we have added outstanding talent to our leadership teams to enhance the development and execution of our business strategies," said Tim Wadhams.
"In addition, we recently announced our agreement between Masco Contractor Services and Owens Corning, which we believe will grow sales, create efficiencies in logistics, lower working capital, provide consistent supply and better service for our customers. We are confident about the long-term fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets and we are optimistic about the future. We expect that improvements in our markets and consumer spending together with the changes we are driving across Masco will create significant value for our shareholders and want to thank the Masco Team for their continued dedication to making it all happen," said Tim Wadhams.
Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
