On February13, 2012, Masco Corporation (the "Company") and Masco Europe S. r.l. ("Masco Europe") entered into Amendment No. 2 (deemed to be effective and applicable as of December 31, 2011) (the "Second Amendment") to the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated June 21, 2010 by and among the Company and Masco Europe as borrowers, various lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders. The Second Amendment provides for the add-back to shareholders' equity in the Company's debt to capitalization covenant of (i) certain non-cash charges (including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets) and (ii) changes to the valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets included in income tax expense, each taken in 2010 and 2011, which aggregate $1.6 billion after tax. The Second Amendment also permits the Company to add-back, if incurred, up to $250 million in the aggregate of future non-cash charges subsequent to December 31, 2011. The Second Amendment also revised the permitted ratio of consolidated EBITDA to the consolidated interest expense to 2.25 to 1.00 through December 31, 2012, increasing to 2.50 to 1.00 with respect to each quarter thereafter.
Taking the Second Amendment into account, at December 31, 2011, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $630 million. Alternatively, at December 31, 2011, the Company could absorb a reduction to shareholders' equity of approximately $340 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant.
The Bank of New York Mellon is one of the lenders under the Credit Agreement. An affiliate of The Bank of New York Mellon acts as trustee under the Company's indentures. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, various lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have performed investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for the Company and its affiliates, including acting as lenders under various loan facilities and as underwriters in offerings of the Company's securities.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
