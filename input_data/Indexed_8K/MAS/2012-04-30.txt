2012 First Quarter Commentary
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that net sales for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012 increased seven percent, to $1.9 billion, compared to the first quarter of 2011. North American sales increased nine percent and International sales increased one percent. In local currencies, International sales increased five percent compared with the first quarter of 2011.
Taylor, Mich., (April 30, 2012) 
Income (loss) from continuing operations was $.05 per common share and $(.04) per common share for the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, excluding the items in Exhibit A and with a normalized tax rate of 36 percent. Including these items, income (loss) from continuing operations, as reported was $.11 per common share and $(.12) per common share for the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively.
"Sales in the quarter were positively impacted by volume growth in both our repair and remodel and new home construction channels. This growth was driven by share gains, new product introductions and positive housing dynamics," said Masco's CEO Tim Wadhams. "Our results this quarter include solid improvement in margins and earnings per share, reflecting our focus on total cost productivity and the positive effects of our operating leverage. In addition, we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing debt of $400 million at an attractive rate to partially prefund our July 2012 debt maturity."
Income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 included gains of $16 million and $17 million pre-tax, respectively, related to financial investments.
As previously communicated, 2011 marked the completion of our major rationalization activities in our cabinet and installation businesses. During the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, we incurred costs and charges of $12 million pre-tax ($.02 per common share, after tax) and $32 million pre-tax ($.06 per common share, after tax), respectively, related to Company-wide business rationalization initiatives. We anticipate that full-year 2012 rationalization charges, for the entire Company, will aggregate approximately $20 million, as previously communicated.
Outlook 2012
"Our first quarter results improved compared to last year and we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of 2012. We are making progress on our strategic initiatives, which include leveraging our brands, reducing our costs, improving our Installation and Cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet. Our installation and cabinet businesses improved their performance by over $25 million in operating profit, in aggregate compared to first quarter 2011. Although the cabinetry business continues to be challenged by aggressive promotional activity and consumers' deferral of big ticket purchases, both businesses are benefiting from improved residential new construction and total cost productivity. We continue to believe we will achieve significant improvement in both cabinetry and installation in 2012. Although weak Euro Zone macro-economic conditions remain a concern for 2012, North American housing activity appears to be improving, and we continue to believe we are positioned to outperform the industry recovery," said Tim Wadhams.
Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
