Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Masco Corporation (the "Company") has reached an agreement in principle to settle the Columbus Drywall, Inc. litigation. We have agreed to pay $75 million in exchange for full release of all claims, which cover the period 1999 to 2004. While we continue to deny that the challenged conduct was unlawful, and we do not admit to any wrongdoing, this business decision eliminates the considerable expense and uncertainty of continued litigation and is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The settlement, which is still subject to court approval, will result in a charge to our earnings in the second quarter of 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
