2012 Third Quarter Commentary
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) today reported that its net sales of $2 billion for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 were flat compared to the third quarter of 2011. North American sales increased four percent and International sales decreased twelve percent. In local currencies, International sales decreased three percent compared with the third quarter of 2011.
Taylor, Mich., (October 29, 2012) 
Income from continuing operations was $.13 per common share and $.09 per common share for the third quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, excluding the items in Exhibit A and with a normalized tax rate of 36 percent. Including these items, income from continuing operations, as reported was $.06 per common share compared to $.16 per common share for the third quarter of 2011.
"Our top line in the third quarter benefitted from the increase in new home construction activity in North America, new product introductions, and from selling price increases," said Masco's CEO, Tim Wadhams. "These positives offset both the slow economic growth in North America and the continued weakening of Euro-Zone economies that we anticipated for the second half of 2012. On an adjusted basis, our margins improved on flat sales to 7.2 percent compared to 6.5 percent in third quarter 2011, driven by our focus on total cost productivity and improved price/commodity relationships. We are pleased with that outcome."
During the third quarters of 2012 and 2011, we incurred pre-tax costs and charges of $28 million and $13 million, respectively, related to business rationalization initiatives. We expect full year 2012 business rationalization charges to be approximately $65 million. In the Other Specialty Products segment, as reported, one of the businesses was negatively impacted in the third quarter by a $12 million adjustment to its warranty expense as a result of the periodic review of warranty claim activity, sales volume, demographics and the estimated cost to service anticipated claims.
 
"We continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, which include leveraging our brands, reducing our costs, improving our Installation and Cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet. We are encouraged by the continued strength in new home construction activity, driven by the stabilization and improvement of home prices in many areas of the U.S., increasing affordability and demographic trends. These factors should continue to drive demand for new homes over the next several years. Increased new home construction activity benefits virtually all of our businesses, particularly our Installation segment which has improved significantly this year, almost breaking even in the third quarter and which we expect to be profitable in the fourth quarter. In our Cabinet segment, we announced actions during the quarter, including the closure of a manufacturing location and a headcount reduction, which we expect will improve our efficiency and reduce costs by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. While we are committed to returning our Cabinet segment to profitability, we anticipate that big ticket remodeling will remain weak, even though we continue to see modest improvement in overall repair and remodeling activity," said Tim Wadhams.
Headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, Masco Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of home improvement and building products, as well as a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products.
