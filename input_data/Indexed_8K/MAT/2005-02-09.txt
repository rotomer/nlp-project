Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
 
 
On February 7, 2005, Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") and Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America") entered into a commitment letter dated February 4, 2005, authorizing Bank of America to commence syndication efforts associated with amending Mattel's Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 19, 2004 (the "domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility.") Bank of America currently acts as a lender and the administrative agent and its affiliate was sole lead arranger and sole book manager in connection with the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility. Additionally, Bank of America currently acts as the administrative agent and a purchaser under the domestic receivables sales facility that is a sub-facility of the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility. Bank of America and Mattel also have various banking arrangements conducted in the ordinary course of business.
 
Bank of America has committed an aggregate of up to $200 million to the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility, with the balance to be raised in the syndicated bank loan market.
 
Upon successful completion of the syndication and at the time of closing, Mattel's domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility will be amended to extend the term until March 31, 2010 from its current expiration on March 31, 2007. If there are sufficient aggregate commitments, Mattel has the option to increase the size of the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion from its current size of $1.3 billion. All other terms and conditions of the amended facility will be substantially similar to the existing facility, including the debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios.
 
Mattel expects that the closing of the domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility will occur in March 2005. While management knows of no reason why Mattel will not be able to achieve this goal, there can be no assurance.
 
The foregoing brief summary of the commitment letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the commitment letter, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.0 herewith.

BAS intends to commence syndication efforts promptly, and you agree to actively assist BAS, by using commercially reasonable efforts, in achieving a syndication of the Senior Credit Facility that is satisfactory to BAS and the Borrower. Such assistance shall include (a) your providing and causing your advisors to provide us and the other Lenders upon reasonable request with all information reasonably available and reasonably deemed necessary by us to complete syndication; (b) your assistance in the preparation of an Information Memorandum to be used in connection with the syndication of the Senior Credit Facility; (c) your using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts of BAS benefit materially from your existing lending and investment banking relationships; and (d) otherwise using commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in our syndication efforts, including by making senior management and advisors of the Borrower and its subsidiaries reasonably available from time to time to attend and make presentations regarding the business and prospects of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, as appropriate, at one or more meetings of prospective Lenders.
 
It is understood and agreed that Bank of America and BAS, together with the Borrower, will manage and control all aspects of the syndication, including decisions as to the selection of proposed Lenders and any titles offered to proposed Lenders, when commitments will be accepted and the final allocations of the commitments among the Lenders.

clearly and conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word "PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials "PUBLIC," you shall be deemed to have authorized BAS, Bank of America and the proposed Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws, it being understood that certain of such Borrower Materials may be subject to the confidentiality requirements of the definitive credit documentation; (y) all Borrower Materials marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated "Public Investor;" and (z) BAS and Bank of America shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked "PUBLIC" as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not designated "Public Investor." Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall be under no obligation to mark any Borrower Materials "PUBLIC."
 
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Borrower agrees to pay within 30 days after submission or an invoice therefore (a) all the actual and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparation of the Senior Credit Facility and the syndication thereof and all the actual costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for the Borrower (including without limitation any opinions reasonably requested by the Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder), and of the Borrower's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained therein on its part to be performed or complied with; (b) the actual cost of delivering to the Lenders any Notes pursuant to the provisions of the credit agreement; and (c) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent's counsel (including the allocated cost of Administrative Agent's inhouse counsel and staff) and all CUSIP fees for registration with the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Senior Credit Facility and any amendments and waiver hereto.
