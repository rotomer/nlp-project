Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
 
 
On October 17, 2005, Mattel Asia Pacific Sourcing Limited ("MAPS"), a subsidiary of Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel"), entered into a commitment letter dated October 12, 2005 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent ("Bank of America"), and Banc of America Securities LLC , as sole lead arranger and book manager ("BAS"), regarding the arrangement and syndication of senior credit facilities in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $325 million. MAPS' payment obligations under the MAPS senior credit facilities will be guaranteed by Mattel. Bank of America currently acts as a lender and the administrative agent and BAS was sole lead arranger and sole book manager in connection with Mattel's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 23, 2005. Additionally, Bank of America currently acts as the administrative agent and a purchaser under the domestic receivables sales facility that is a sub-facility under Mattel's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Bank of America and Mattel also have various banking arrangements conducted in the ordinary course of business.
 
Bank of America has committed an aggregate of up to $50 million to the MAPS senior credit facilities, with the balance to be raised in the syndicated bank loan market.
 
The commitment letter provides that the MAPS senior credit facilities will consist of a $225 million term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility, both maturing on the third anniversary of the closing. MAPS anticipates that the closing of the MAPS senior credit facilities will occur on or before December 30, 2005. While MAPS' management knows of no reason why MAPS will not be able to achieve this goal, there can be no assurance.
 
The foregoing brief summary of the commitment letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the commitment letter, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.0 herewith.

Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America") is pleased to offer to be the sole and exclusive administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent") for Senior Credit Facilities in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $325,000,000 (the "Senior Credit Facilities") to Mattel Asia Pacific Sourcing Limited (the "Borrower"), an indirect subsidiary of Mattel, Inc.

No additional agents, co-agents or arrangers will be appointed and no other titles will be awarded without our prior approval on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and Bank of America.

BAS intends to commence syndication efforts promptly, and you agree to actively assist BAS, by using commercially reasonable efforts, in achieving a syndication of the Senior Credit Facilities that is satisfactory to BAS and the Borrower. Such assistance shall include (a) your providing and causing the Parent and your and the Parent's respective advisors to provide us and the other Lenders upon reasonable request with all information reasonably available and reasonably deemed necessary by us to complete syndication; (b) your assistance, and your providing the Parent's assistance, in the preparation of an Information Memorandum to be used in connection with the syndication of the Senior Credit Facilities; (c) your using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts of BAS benefit materially from your and the Parent's existing lending and investment banking relationships; and (d) otherwise using commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in our syndication efforts, including by making senior management and advisors of the Borrower, the Parent and their respective subsidiaries reasonably available from time to time to attend and make presentations regarding the business and prospects of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, as appropriate, at one or more meetings of prospective Lenders.
 
2. It is understood and agreed that Bank of America and BAS, together with the Borrower, will manage and control all aspects of the syndication, including decisions as to the selection of proposed Lenders and any titles offered to proposed Lenders, when commitments will be accepted and the final allocations of the commitments among the Lenders. It is understood and agreed that no Lender

4. You and the Parent hereby represent, warrant and covenant that (a) all information, other than Projections (defined below), which has been made available since December 31, 2004 or is hereafter made available to Bank of America, BAS or the Lenders by you, the Parent or any of your or the Parent's representatives (or on your or their behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Information") is and will be complete and correct in all material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading except to the extent that any such statement or omission that was untrue or misleading at the time made or that subsequently became untrue or misleading has been superseded or corrected by information provided to the Lenders prior to the date of this letter, and (b) all financial projections concerning the Borrower and its subsidiaries that have been or are hereafter made available to Bank of America, BAS or the Lenders by you, the Parent or any of your or the Parent's representatives (the "Projections") are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the Borrower and the Parent to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such Projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may differ from the projected results.Except as disclosed in the Information, there is no fact known to the officers of the Borrower or the Parent as of the date of this letter (other than matters of a general economic nature) which materially adversely affect the business, operations, property, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which has not been disclosed herein or in any financial statement.You agree to furnish us with such Information as we may reasonably request and to supplement the Information from time to time until the closing date for the Senior Credit Facilities so that the representation, warranty and covenant in the preceding sentences are correct on such closing date. You understand that in arranging and syndicating the Senior Credit Facilities, Bank of America and BAS will be using and relying on the Information without independent verification thereof.

non-public information with respect to the Borrower, the Parent or their securities) (each, a "Public Lender"). You hereby agree that (w) all Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word "PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower Materials "PUBLIC," you shall be deemed to have authorized BAS, Bank of America and the proposed Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower, the Parent or their securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws, it being understood that certain of such Borrower Materials may be subject to the confidentiality requirements of the definitive credit documentation; (y) all Borrower Materials marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated "Public Investor;" and (z) BAS and Bank of America shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked "PUBLIC" as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not designated "Public Investor." Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall be under no obligation to mark any Borrower Materials "PUBLIC."
 
6. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Borrower agrees to pay within 30 days after submission of an invoice therefore (a) all the actual and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparation of the Senior Credit Facilities and the syndication thereof and all the actual costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for the Borrower or the Parent (including without limitation any opinions reasonably requested by the Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder), and of the Borrower's or the Parent's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained therein on their part to be performed or complied with; (b) the actual cost of delivering to the Lenders any Notes pursuant to the provisions of the credit agreement; and (c) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent's counsel (including the allocated cost of Administrative Agent's inhouse counsel and staff) and all CUSIP fees for registration with the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Senior Credit Facilities and any amendments and waiver hereto.
 
7. Subject to numbered paragraph 11 following, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Bank of America, BAS, each Lender and each of their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents and other representatives (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against (and will reimburse each Indemnified Party as the same are incurred for) any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel and the allocated cost of internal counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in connection therewith) any matters contemplated by this letter, any related transaction, the Senior Credit Facilities or any use made or proposed to be made with the proceeds thereof unless and only to the extent that, as to any Indemnified Party, it shall be determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. In the case of an investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by you, your equity holders or creditors, the Parent, its equity holders or creditors or an Indemnified Party, whether or not an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. You and the Parent also agree that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to you or the Parent or your or the Parent's subsidiaries or affiliates or to your or the Parent's their respective equity holders or creditors arising out of, related to or in connection with any aspect of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent of direct, as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive, damages determined in a final non-appealable

judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. It is further agreed that Bank of America shall only have liability to you (as opposed to any other person), that Bank of America shall be liable solely in respect of its own commitment to the Senior Credit Facilities on a several, and not joint, basis with any other Lender, and that such liability shall only arise to the extent damages have been caused by a breach of Bank of America's obligations hereunder to negotiate in good faith definitive documentation for the Senior Credit Facilities on the terms set forth herein as determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Commitment Letter, no Indemnified Party shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through Internet, Intralinks or other electronic information transmission systems in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities.
