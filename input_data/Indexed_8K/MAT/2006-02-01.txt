As disclosed in October 2005, Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") has consolidated its previously existing Mattel Brands and Fisher-Price Brands divisions into one division called "Mattel Brands." In connection with this consolidation, Mattel is executing an initiative to streamline and rationalize its workforce, primarily at Mattel's headquarters in El Segundo, California. It is expected that this initiative will result in a net reduction of over 200 positions through a combination of layoffs, eliminations of open requisitions, attrition and retirements, which will be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2006. The positions affected by the reduction in force represent approximately 1% of Mattel's worldwide workforce. Expenses of approximately $10 to $13 million are expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2006 with regard to this initiative.
