Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 16, 2007, Mattel issued a press release regarding its first quarter 2007 financial results, a copy of which is furnished at Exhibit 99.1 hereto. This exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In its first quarter 2007 press release, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful. A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is provided in Exhibit II to the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
 
In its first quarter 2007 press release, Mattel discloses the impact of certain items on reported earnings per share, which may be non-GAAP financial measures. These measures have been disclosed since they could be meaningful in evaluating Mattel's operating results and financial condition for the quarter in light of the nature and magnitude of the amounts. These measures are used by management to analyze the profitability of Mattel's business for the quarter.

First Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., April 16, 2007  Mattel, Inc. (NYSE: MAT) today reported 2007 first quarter financial results. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $12 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to last year's first quarter net income of $30.2 million, or $0.08 per share. Last year's quarterly net income was positively impacted by tax benefits of approximately $57 million, or $0.15 per share, relating to audit settlements with foreign tax authorities.
 
"While not a particularly significant quarter within the seasonal toy industry, our positive first quarter results are a good start to the year," said Robert A. Eckert, chairman and chief executive officer of Mattel. "I am pleased with the performance of our strong portfolio of brands, including nice increases in the Fisher-Price and Wheels businesses and continued strength of the Disney/Pixar CARS entertainment property. Our international business continued to generate strong growth around the world, and we benefited from improved gross margins."
