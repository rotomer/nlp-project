Item 5.02(b). Departure of Directors.
On May 18, 2007, effective as of the election of directors at Mattel's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Eugene P. Beard and John L. Vogelstein retired from Mattel's Board of Directors.
Mattel's Board of Directors Amended and Restated Guidelines on Corporate Governance contain a provision pursuant to which, after attaining the age of 72, a director will not stand for re-election to the Board at subsequent meetings of the stockholders. Mr. Beard, who had served as a director since 2000, and Mr. Vogelstein, who had served as a director since 1983, were each 72 years old at the time of the Annual Meeting, and accordingly they did not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors. The size of the Board of Directors was reduced to eleven members effective as of the election of directors at the Annual Meeting.
Item 5.02(e). Compensatory Arrangements.
Stockholder approval of Mattel Incentive Plan.
On May 18, 2007, at Mattel's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Mattel's stockholders approved the Mattel Incentive Plan, pursuant to Proposal 4 in the Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement.
New Forms of Grant Agreements for Employees Pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan.
At its meeting on May 17, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved new standard forms of grant agreements for grants of NQSOs and RSUs to employees pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (the "2005 Plan"). The new forms of grant agreements for grants of NQSOs and RSUs to employees are filed herewith as Exhibits 99.0 and 99.1, respectively.
These new forms of grant agreements are for grants to employees who do not have employment agreements requiring special provisions. The forms provide that NQSOs vest in three annual installments of 33%, 33% and 34% respectively on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, and that RSUs vest 50% on the second anniversary and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the grantee's continued employment. These new forms also contain provisions regarding the impact of various events such as a change in control and termination of employment. Among other things, for NQSOs, the new form provides that termination of employment as a result of (1) retirement after attaining the age of 55 and completing five years of service, (2) death, or (3) disability results in the accelerated vesting of unvested NQSOs granted at least six months prior to the date of termination. In such a case, NQSOs for which vesting is accelerated remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the termination or the end of their original term, whichever occurs first. In addition, for RSUs, the new form provides that termination of employment as a result of (1) involuntary retirement after attaining the age of 55 and completing five years of service, (2) death, or (3) disability results in the accelerated vesting of RSUs granted at least six months prior to the date of termination.
Robert A. Eckert, Neil B. Friedman, Kevin M. Farr and Thomas A. Debrowski, who are each Named Executive Officers of Mattel, have employment agreements with provisions that require that their grants of NQSOs contain certain terms. In addition, Mr. Eckert's employment agreement has provisions that require his RSU grants to contain certain terms. At its meeting on May 17, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved new forms of grant agreements for grants of NQSOs to Mr. Friedman, Mr. Farr and Mr. Debrowski pursuant to the 2005 Plan, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 99.2 through 99.4, and a new form of grant agreement for grants of RSUs to Mr. Eckert, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.5. These forms of grant agreements generally conform to the forms for other employees, but incorporate terms required by the executives' respective employment agreements. The new form of grant agreement for grants of RSUs to Mr. Eckert incorporates updated language intended to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, in response to guidance recently issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
This summary description of provisions of the above-referenced grant agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 99.0 through 99.5.
New Forms of Grant Agreements for Non-Employee Directors Pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan.
At its meeting on May 17, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved new forms of grant agreements pursuant to the 2005 Plan for Initial Grants and Annual Grants (as defined in the 2005 Plan) to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs") and restricted stock units with dividend equivalents ("RSUs"). The new forms of grant agreements for Initial Grants of NQSOs and RSUs are filed herewith as Exhibits 99.6 and Exhibit 99.7, respectively, and the new forms of grant agreements for Annual Grants of NQSOs and RSUs are filed herewith as Exhibits 99.8 and 99.9, respectively.
Initial Grants of NQSOs are immediately vested. The new form of grant agreement for Initial Grants of RSUs provides that the RSUs vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided that an Initial Grant of RSUs that is made on the date of an annual meeting of stockholders will vest on the earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the third annual meeting of stockholders after the grant date.
For Annual Grants of NQSOs to non-employee directors, which are made to continuing directors on the dates of annual meetings of stockholders, the new form of grant agreement provides that vesting will occur as follows: (a) 33% on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the first annual meeting of stockholders after the grant date; (b) an additional 33% on the earlier of the second anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the second annual meeting of stockholders after the grant date; and (c) the remaining 34% on the earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the third annual meeting of stockholders after the grant date.
For Annual Grants of RSUs to non-employee directors, which are made to continuing directors on the dates of annual meetings of stockholders, the new forms of grant agreements provide that vesting will occur as follows: (a) 50% on the earlier of the second anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the second annual meeting of Mattel's stockholders that occurs after the grant date; and (b) the remainder on earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or the day immediately preceding the third annual meeting of stockholders that occurs after the grant date.
The grant agreements for Initial and Annual Grants of RSUs have alternative language because the tax treatment of the RSUs is different depending upon whether or not the grantee has already attained, or will by the time of full vesting of the RSUs have attained, age 55 and five years of service at the time of the grant. The new forms contain updated language intended to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code for those RSU grants that are subject to that provision.
The grant agreements for Initial and Annual Grants of Options and RSUs contain provisions regarding the impact of various events such as a change in control and termination of Board service. Among other things, the grant agreements provide that termination of Board service as a result of (1) retirement after attaining the age of 55 and completing five years of service, (2) death, or (3) disability results in the accelerated vesting of unvested NQSOs and RSUs granted at least six months prior to the date of termination. In such a case, NQSOs for which vesting is accelerated remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the termination or the end of their original term, whichever occurs first.
This summary description of provisions of the above-referenced grant agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 99.6 through 99.9.

Exhibit 99.0
This is a Grant Agreement between Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") and the individual (the "Holder") named in the Notice of Grant of Stock Option (the "Notice") attached hereto as the cover page of this Grant Agreement.
Recitals
Mattel has adopted the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the granting to selected employees of awards based upon shares of Common Stock of Mattel. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") has approved the execution of this Grant Agreement between the Company and the Holder. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Plan.
Option
Mattel grants to the Holder a Non-Qualified Stock Option (this "Option") to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth below in this Grant Agreement and in any Addendum to this Grant Agreement (where applicable), all or any part of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock set forth in the Notice, which shall remain outstanding during the period (the "Term") expiring on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the grant (the "Grant Date"), as specified in the Notice, unless and to the extent this Option is terminated or forfeited before the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5 or 6 below. The per-share exercise price of this Option equals the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date, and is set forth in the Notice.
1. .
Terms
Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, this Option shall vest and become exercisable with regard to the following percentages of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option on the vesting dates set forth below, unless the Holder's Severance has occurred prior to the applicable vesting date:
2. .
Vesting and Exercisability
 
(Note: If 33% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option is not a whole number of shares, then (a) the amount vesting one year after the Grant Date shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, (b) any fractional amount that, as a result of such rounding, did not vest one year after the Grant Date shall be counted toward the amount
 
vesting two years after the Grant Date, and the amount vesting two years after the Grant Date shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and (c) the amount vesting three years after the Grant Date shall be such that 100% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option shall be cumulatively vested three years after the Grant Date.)
In order to exercise this Option in whole or in part, the Holder shall follow such procedures as may be established by the Company from time to time, including through any automated system that the Company may establish for itself or using the services of a third party, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response. In order for such exercise to be considered effective, the Holder must satisfy the withholding obligations of Section 4 below and the certification obligation of Section 5 below, and make full payment of the exercise price for the shares being purchased in accordance with such methods as the Committee may approve from time to time. As of the Grant Date, the following forms of payment are available:
3. .
Method of Exercising
i. cash;
ii. by the withholding of shares that would otherwise be issued upon the exercise of the Option; and
iii. by the delivery to Mattel or its designated agent of an irrevocable written notice of exercise form together with irrevocable instructions to a broker-dealer to sell or margin a sufficient portion of the shares of Common Stock and to deliver the sale or margin loan proceeds directly to Mattel to pay the exercise price of the Option.
As a condition to exercising this Option in whole or in part, the Holder shall pay, or make provisions satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any income tax, social tax, or other taxes required to be withheld in connection with such exercise, including by delivery of Common Stock and/or the withholding of Common Stock being purchased in the exercise in question, having a Fair Market Value, on the date of exercise, equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld.
4. .
Withholding
The Holder specifically acknowledges that this Option is subject to the provisions of Section 18 of the Plan, entitled "Termination, Rescission and Recapture," which can cause the forfeiture of this Option, the rescission of Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of this Option and/or the recapture of proceeds of the sale of such Common Stock. Except as provided in the next sentence, as a condition of the exercise of this Option, the Holder will be required to certify that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and, if a Severance has occurred, to state the name and address of his or her then-current employer or any entity for which the Holder performs business services and his or her title, and shall identify any organization or business in which the Holder owns a greater-than-five-percent equity interest. Section 18 of the Plan is inapplicable, and accordingly such certification shall not be required, in connection with any exercise after a Severance of the Holder that occurs within the 18-month period after a Change in Control.
5. .
Termination, Rescission and Recapture
 
The consequences of the Holder's Severance for this Option shall be as follows, subject to Section 5 above:
6. .
Consequences of Severance
i. in the case of a Severance for Cause, this Option (whether vested or unvested) shall terminate immediately;
ii. in the case of the Holder's Severance at least six months after the Grant Date as a result of Retirement, death or Disability, this Option shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately, to the extent not previously vested and exercisable, and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (I) the fifth anniversary of the date of the Severance and (II) the end of the Term; and
iii. in the case of a Severance for any other reason, (A) any portion of this Option that has previously vested shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (I) the 90th day after the date of the Severance and (II) the end of the Term, and (B) any portion of this Option that has not previously vested shall terminate immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 90-day period referred to in clause (iii) above shall be extended to a two-year period if the Severance occurs during the 18-month period following a Change in Control.
7. .
Compliance with Law
i. No shares issuable upon the exercise of this Option shall be issued and delivered unless and until all applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall have been complied with. In particular, the Committee may require certain investment (or other) representations and undertakings in connection with the issuance of securities in connection with the Plan in order to comply with applicable law.
ii. If any provision of this Grant Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law. Furthermore, if any provision of this Grant Agreement is determined to be illegal under any applicable law, such provision shall be null and void to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, but the other provisions of this Grant Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
This Option shall not be transferable by the Holder, other than upon the death of the Holder, in accordance with such beneficiary designation procedures or other procedures as the Company may prescribe from time to time. This Option shall be exercisable, subject to the terms of the Plan and this Grant Agreement, only by the Holder, the guardian or legal representative of the Holder as provided in Section 9(c) of the Plan, or any person to whom this Option is permissibly transferred pursuant to this Section 8 and Section 15(a) of the Plan, it being understood that the term "Holder" includes such guardian, legal

representative and other transferee; provided, that references to employment or other provision of services to the Company (such as the terms "Disability," "Retirement" and "Severance") shall continue to refer to the employment of, or provision of services by, the original Holder named above.
In the event of certain corporate transactions, this Option shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16 of the Plan. In the event of a Change in Control, this Option shall be subject to the provisions of Section 17 of the Plan.
9. .
Certain Corporate Transactions

No Additional Rights
i. Neither the granting of this Option nor its exercise shall (a) affect or restrict in any way the power of the Company to undertake any corporate action otherwise permitted under applicable law, (b) confer upon the Holder the right to continue performing services for the Company, or (c) interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the services of the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
ii. The Holder acknowledges that (a) this is a one-time grant, (b) the making of this grant does not mean that the Holder will receive any similar grant or grants in the future, or any future grants at all, and (c) this grant does not in any way entitle the Holder to future grants under the Plan, if any, and the Company retains sole and absolute discretion as to whether to make any additional grants to the Holder in the future and, if so, the quantity, terms, conditions and provisions of any such grants.
iii. Without limiting the generality of subsections i. and ii. immediately above, if the Holder's employment with the Company terminates, the Holder shall not be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit or prospective right or benefit under this Option or the Plan which he or she might otherwise have enjoyed, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful dismissal or other breach of contract or by way of compensation for loss of office or otherwise.
Neither the Holder nor any other person legally entitled to exercise this Option shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by this Option until such shares have been issued to the Holder following the exercise of this Option.
11. .

Exhibit 99.1
This is a Grant Agreement between Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") and the individual (the "Holder") named in the Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units (the "Notice") attached hereto as the cover page of this Grant Agreement.
Recitals
Mattel has adopted the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the granting to selected employees of awards based upon shares of Common Stock of Mattel. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") has approved the execution of this Grant Agreement between Mattel and the Holder. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
Mattel grants to the Holder the number of restricted stock units based on shares of Common Stock set forth in the Notice (the "Units"), subject to adjustment, forfeiture and the other terms and conditions set forth below and in any Addendum to this Grant Agreement (where applicable), as of the effective date of the grant (the "Grant Date") specified in the Notice. The Company and the Holder acknowledge that the Units (a) are being granted hereunder in exchange for the Holder's agreement to provide services to the Company after the Grant Date, for which the Holder will otherwise not be fully compensated, and which the Company deems to have a value at least equal to the aggregate par value of the Shares, if any, that the Holder may become entitled to receive under this Agreement, and (b) will, except as provided in Section 4 hereof, be forfeited by the Holder if the Holder's Severance occurs before they vest, and are subject to cancellation if the Holder engages in certain conduct detrimental to the Company, in each case as more fully set forth in this Grant Agreement and the Plan.
1. .
Grant
The Units are granted with Dividend Equivalent rights, as set forth in this Section 2. As of the payment date for any cash dividend or distribution with respect to the Common Stock with a record date on or after the Grant Date and before all of the Units are settled or forfeited as set forth below, the Holder shall receive a cash payment with respect to the outstanding Units held by the Holder that have not yet been settled or forfeited on such record date (the "Then-Outstanding Units"), in an amount equal to the cash dividend or distribution that would have been paid or distributed to the Holder had the Then-Outstanding Units been actual shares of Common Stock outstanding on the applicable record date; provided, that the Committee shall determine whether a payment shall be made with respect to a dividend or distribution made in connection with an event described in Section 16 of the Plan (whether or not an adjustment under Section 16 of the Plan is made to the Units in connection with that event), and the amount of any such payment; and the Committee shall determine whether
2. .
Dividend Equivalent Rights
 
a payment shall be made with respect to a dividend or distribution with respect to the Common Stock in the form of Common Stock or other property other than cash, and the amount of any such payment.
One-half of the Units (rounded down to the nearest whole number, if one-half of the Units is not a whole number) shall vest on the second anniversary of the Grant Date, and the remainder of the Units shall vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date, in each case unless the Holder's Severance has occurred before the applicable anniversary, and subject to Section 5 below. In the event of a Change in Control prior to the Holder's Severance, all unvested Units shall vest in full.
3. .
Normal Vesting
The consequences of the Holder's Severance before the third anniversary of the Grant Date and before a Change in Control shall be as follows:
4. .
Consequences of Severance
i. In the case of a Severance for Cause, the Units that have not yet vested shall be forfeited as of the date of the Severance.
ii. In the case of a Severance as a result of the Holder's death, Disability or Involuntary Retirement (as defined below) at least six months after the Grant Date, the Units that have not yet vested shall vest as of the date of the Severance; and
iii. In all other cases, the Units that have not yet vested shall be forfeited as of the date of the Severance.
For these purposes, the term "Involuntary Retirement" means a Severance (as defined in the Plan) that is classified by the Company in its human resources database as an involuntary separation and that qualifies as a Retirement (as defined in the Plan).
The Holder specifically acknowledges that the Units and any Common Stock or cash delivered in settlement thereof are subject to the provisions of Section 18 of the Plan, entitled "Termination, Rescission and Recapture," which can cause the forfeiture of the Units and/or the recapture of any Common Stock and/or cash delivered in settlement thereof and/or the proceeds of the sale of any such Common Stock. Except as provided in the next sentence, as a condition of the vesting and settlement of Units, the Holder will be required to certify that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan (including the Conditions set forth in Section 18 of the Plan) and, if a Severance has occurred, to state the name and address of his or her then-current employer or any entity for which the Holder performs business services and his or her title, and shall identify any organization or business in which the Holder owns a greater-than-five-percent equity interest. Section 18 of the Plan is inapplicable, and accordingly such certification shall not be required, after a Severance of the Holder that occurs within the 18-month period after a Change in Control.
5. .
Termination, Rescission and Recapture
Upon the vesting of a Unit, the Company shall settle such Unit by delivering to the Holder one share of Common Stock or a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of such vesting (the "Settlement Date"), as the Company may in its sole discretion determine (and the Company may settle some Units in Common Stock and some in cash), subject to Section
6. .
Consequences of Vesting
 
8 below. In the case of Units settled by delivery of Common Stock, the Company shall (a) issue or cause to be delivered to the Holder (or the Holder's Heir, as defined below, if applicable) one or more unlegended stock certificates representing such shares, or (b) cause a book entry for such shares to be made in the name of the Holder (or the Holder's Heir, if applicable). In the case of the Holder's death, the cash and/or Common Stock to be delivered in settlement of vested Units as described above shall be delivered to the Holder's beneficiary or beneficiaries (as designated in the manner determined by the Committee), or if no beneficiary is so designated or if no beneficiary survives the Holder, then the Holder's administrator, executor, personal representative, or other person to whom the Units are transferred by means of the Holder's will or the laws of descent and distribution (such beneficiary, beneficiaries or other person(s), the "Holder's Heir").
The Company believes that the Units do not constitute "deferred compensation" within the meaning of recently enacted Section 409A of the Code. In view of uncertainty surrounding Section 409A of the Code, however, if Mattel determines after the Grant Date that an amendment to this Grant Agreement is necessary or advisable to ensure that the Units will not be subject to Section 409A, or alternatively to ensure that they comply with Section 409A, it may make such amendment, effective as of the Grant Date or at any later date, without the consent of the Holder.
7. .
Code Section 409A
The Company shall withhold from the cash and/or Common Stock delivered in settlement of Units shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, on the Settlement Date, and/or cash, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum required withholding, if any, of any income tax, social tax, or other taxes (but rounding up to the nearest whole number of shares). If any such taxes are required to be withheld at a date earlier than the Settlement Date, then notwithstanding any other provision of this Grant Agreement, the Company may (i) satisfy such obligation by causing the forfeiture a number of Units having a Fair Market Value, on such earlier date, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum required amount of such withholding, or (ii) make such other arrangements with the Holder for such withholding as may be satisfactory to the Company in its sole discretion.
8. .
Tax Withholding
9. .
Compliance with Law
i. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered pursuant to a vested Unit unless and until all applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all applicable listing requirements of any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over such issuance and delivery, shall have been complied with. In particular, the Committee may require certain investment (or other) representations and undertakings in connection with the issuance of securities in connection with the Plan in order to comply with applicable law.
ii. If any provision of this Grant Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any
 
limitations required under applicable law. Furthermore, if any provision of this Grant Agreement is determined to be illegal under any applicable law, such provision shall be null and void to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, but the other provisions of this Grant Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Except as may be effected by designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries in such manner as may be determined by the Committee, or as may be effected by will or other testamentary disposition or by the laws of descent and distribution, any attempt to assign the Units before they vest and are settled shall be of no effect.
10. .
Assignability
In the event of certain corporate transactions, the Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.

Certain Corporate Transactions

No Additional Rights
i. Neither the granting of the Units nor their vesting or settlement shall (a) affect or restrict in any way the power of the Company to undertake any corporate action otherwise permitted under applicable law, (b) confer upon the Holder the right to continue performing services for the Company, or (c) interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the services of the Holder at any time, with or without Cause.
ii. The Holder acknowledges that (a) this is a one-time grant, (b) the making of this grant does not mean that the Holder will receive any similar grant or grants in the future, or any future grants at all, and (c) this grant does not in any way entitle the Holder to future grants under the Plan, if any, and the Company retains sole and absolute discretion as to whether to make any additional grants to the Holder in the future and, if so, the quantity, terms, conditions and provisions of any such grants.
iii. Without limiting the generality of subsections i. and ii. immediately above, if the Holder's employment with the Company terminates, the Holder shall not be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit or prospective right or benefit relating to the Units or under the Plan which he or she might otherwise have enjoyed, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful dismissal or other breach of contract or by way of compensation for loss of office or otherwise.

iii. in the case of a Severance for any other reason, (A) any portion of this Option that has previously vested shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (I) the date 90 days after the Holder's Severance date, provided that if such Severance occurs during the 18-month period following a Change in Control, then such date shall instead be the date two (2) years after the Holder's Severance date and (II) the Expiration Date, and (B) any portion of this Option that has not previously vested shall terminate immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing subsections 6(i)-(iii), if either subsection (iv) or subsection (v) immediately below applies, and the provisions of such applicable subsection would result in greater acceleration of vesting of all or a portion of this Option, or a longer period to exercise all or a portion of this Option, then the provisions of such applicable paragraph shall govern to the extent that they increase acceleration of vesting and/or extend the period to exercise.
iv. If Mattel terminates the Holder's employment other than for Cause or Disability, or the Holder terminates his employment for Good Reason (in each case, other than within 18 months following a Change of Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement)), then this Option shall vest and become exercisable in full (to the extent not already vested and exercisable) and the Holder will be able to exercise this Option until the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days following such termination of employment or (b) the Expiration Date.

In particular, the Committee may require certain investment (or other) representations and undertakings in connection with the issuance of securities in connection with the Plan in order to comply with applicable law.
 
ii. If any provision of this Grant Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.
