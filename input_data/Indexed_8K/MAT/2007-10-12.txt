Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 15, 2007, Mattel issued a press release regarding its third quarter 2007 financial results, a copy of which is furnished at Exhibit 99.1 hereto. This exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In its third quarter 2007 press release, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful. A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is provided in Exhibit II to the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
 
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
 
This exhibit is furnished pursuant to Items 2.02 and 7.01 hereof and should not be deemed to be "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Third Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., October 15, 2007  Mattel, Inc. (NYSE: MAT) today reported 2007 third quarter financial results. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $236.8 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to last year's third quarter net income of $239.0 million, or $0.62 per share.
 
Third quarter operating income of $310.5 million included charges and incremental costs of approximately $40 million related to the company's product recalls during 2007. Of this total, $13.3 million related to an increase in the reserves recorded in the second quarter for the August recalls, due primarily to higher than anticipated product return rates; $9.1 million related to additional reserves for subsequent product recalls; and approximately $17 million related to incremental recall related legal, advertising and administration costs incurred in the third quarter.
 
"Despite the challenges the company faced during the third quarter, the business has performed fairly well, even with some supply chain disruptions that impacted our sales during the quarter. International has continued to drive growth in every major region, and while the U.S. was down slightly in the quarter, we did continue to see strong performance from several lines, especially Core Fisher-Price and our Disney/Pixar CARS entertainment property," said Robert A. Eckert, chairman and chief executive officer of Mattel. "U.S. Barbie performance was soft and remains an area of focus, although a good portion of the decline in the quarter was directly related to the supply chain disruptions."
