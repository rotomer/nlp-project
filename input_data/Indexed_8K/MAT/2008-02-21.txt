Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plans for Robert A. Eckert to provide for orderly exercises of stock options and the sale of underlying shares of stock prior to the expiration of the stock options
Robert A. Eckert, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel"), has, beginning with a grant in May 2000, received periodic grants of stock options. Each of these grants of stock options expires ten years after its respective grant date, with the initial grant expiring in May 2010.
To provide for the orderly exercise of stock options and the sale of underlying shares of stock prior to the expiration of the stock options, Mattel's Board of Directors has approved guidelines that authorize Mr. Eckert to enter into written, pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These plans are sometimes referred to as "10b5-1 plans." Under the guidelines, Mr. Eckert is permitted to enter into 10b5-1 plans during open trading windows under Mattel's insider trading policy. The guidelines impose limits on the volume of sales that may be effectuated under the 10b5-1 plans and contain other customary limitations.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
