("Mattel") approved an amendment and restatement of the Mattel, Inc. 2005 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "2005 SERP") primarily to bring the 2005 SERP into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A").
