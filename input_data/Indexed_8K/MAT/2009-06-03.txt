On May 29, 2009, pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel" or the "Company") Guidelines Concerning Rule 10b5-1(c) Individual Trading Plans (the "Guidelines"), the following executives of Mattel each entered into separate individual Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plans (individually, a "Plan", and collectively, the "Plans") with a broker to sell shares of Mattel stock to be acquired upon exercise of employee stock options (the "Options"). The Options have a ten year term; some were granted in 1999, others in 2000, and all are nearing expiration. According to Mattel's Guidelines, the first sales under the Plans may not take place until June 29, 2009, 30 days after the date each executive adopted his or her plan:
 
The transactions under each Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Plan was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Mattel's Guidelines. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
