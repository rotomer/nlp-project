Item 5.02(e). Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
As described in the Definitive Proxy Statement filed by Mattel, Inc. ("") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2009, we have employment arrangements with all of our named executive officers. The employment agreements with Kevin M. Farr, Chief Financial Officer, Neil B. Friedman, President, Mattel Brands, and Thomas A. Debrowski, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations have evergreen terms, which means that the term automatically extends on a monthly basis for a specified period (3 years for Messrs. Farr and Friedman and 2 years for Mr. Debrowski) unless Mattel or the executive gives prior written notice to the other that the term will not be further extended. Similarly, the employment letter agreement with Bryan G. Stockton, President, International, is in effect for an indefinite term. A copy of each of the employment and letter agreements, as supplemented and amended, has been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mattel
For the reasons we describe in the next paragraph, on June 30, 2009, Mattel gave written notice to Messrs. Farr, Friedman and Debrowski that their current employment agreements would not be renewed beyond the scheduled expiration dates, which, subject to the terms of the employment agreements, are September 1, 2012 for Messrs. Farr and Friedman and September 1, 2011 for Mr. Debrowski. Mattel currently expects that Messrs. Farr, Friedman and Debrowski will remain employed with Mattel through and following the expiration of the employment agreements. A copy of the notices to Messrs. Farr, Friedman and Debrowski are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02.
Simultaneous with the delivery of the notice of non-renewal, Mattel adopted the Mattel, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the ""). The Compensation Committee decided to provide the non-renewal notice and adopt the Severance Plan in order to make our executive severance program for our named executive officers below the Chief Executive Officer consistent by eliminating individual agreements and to make our executive severance program more reflective of current compensation practices and trends.
Severance Plan
In connection with the adoption of the Severance Plan, the Compensation Committee designated certain of our executive officers, including Messrs. Farr, Debrowski and Stockton, as eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, subject to their timely executing and returning to Mattel a participation letter agreement pursuant to which the executive agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the plan. Messrs. Farr and Debrowski will not be eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan unless they experience a covered termination after the scheduled expiration of their employment agreements. Mr. Stockton will not be eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan unless he experiences a covered termination after he executes and returns his participation letter agreement to Mattel (at which time his employment letter agreement will terminate). Mattel currently expects that Mr. Stockton will remain employed with Mattel through and following the termination of his employment letter agreement.
Once eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan, the executives remain eligible for a rolling one-year period unless Mattel gives prior written notice to any executive that the executive's participation will not be further extended. Once notice is provided, the executives will remain a participant in the Severance Plan for a minimum period of 15 months.
Under the Severance Plan, if an executive's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Severance Plan), the executive will be entitled to the following payments and benefits:
 
 
 
 
 
Under the Severance Plan, the executives are not entitled to be indemnified for any excise tax imposed on them as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in connection with a change of control. Instead, the executives will be required either to pay the excise tax or have his or her payments reduced to an amount which would not trigger the excise tax if it would be more favorable to him or her on an after-tax basis.
In order to be entitled to severance payments and benefits, the executive will be required to execute a general liability release in favor of Mattel and, in certain circumstances, comply with post-employment covenants to protect Mattel's confidential information, not to solicit Mattel's employees and not to disparage or otherwise impair Mattel's reputation, goodwill or commercial interests or any of Mattel's affiliated entities or its or their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products.
Mattel retains the discretion to amend or terminate the Severance Plan, although any amendment that is materially adverse to any executive requires that executive's written consent.
The foregoing description is not a complete description of the Severance Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Severance Plan and the participation letter agreements for Messrs. Farr, Debrowski and Stockton, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Any restricted stock units or any other equity-based compensation (other than stock options) awarded by Mattel to the Participant under the Equity Plans on or after the Participant's Eligibility Date shall vest or become earned in full and shall become immediately payable; provided, however, that if the number of shares that vest or become earned is based on the achievement of pre-established performance goals or criteria, the number of shares that vest or become earned shall be determined in accordance with the Participant's equity award agreements. Payment shall be in the form as provided for in the Equity Plans;
(vi) Until the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination or (y) the date the Participant accepts other employment, Mattel shall provide to the Participant:
(I) the Additional Benefits; and
(II) the Outplacement Services;
(vii) Mattel shall provide the Additional Age and Service Credit.
 
(d)
Non-Covered Termination
If a Participant's employment terminates for any reason other than a Covered Termination, the Participant will not be eligible for Severance Benefits under Sections 3(b) or (c) and Mattel shall pay to the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary or estate) on or promptly after the Date of Termination, a lump-sum cash amount equal to the Accrued Amounts and shall pay or provide the Other Benefits. For example, a Participant will not be eligible for Severance Benefits under Sections 3(b) or (c) of this Plan if the Plan Administrator (as defined in Section 9) determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant's active employment has terminated by reason of 
(i) the Participant's resignation without Good Reason;
(ii) the Participant's death; or
(iii) the Participant's discharge for Cause or Disability.
(e)
Effect of Deferral Elections
If any payment payable pursuant to Section 3 is subject to a valid deferral election under the terms of another plan or arrangement maintained by Mattel, the payment of such amount shall be in accordance with the provisions of such deferred compensation plan or arrangement (including a Participant's deferral elections regarding the form and timing of such deferrals).
(f)
Equity Coordination
If any plan, program, or equity grant applicable to a Participant is more favorable to the Participant than the provisions in Sections 3(b)(v), 3(b)(vi), 3(c)(iv) or 3(c)(v) of this Plan, the provisions of such plan, program, or equity grant shall control over any provisions to the contrary in this Plan.
 
(a)
Tax Withholding
A Participant's Severance Benefits will be subject to withholdings for taxes and any other required payroll deductions.
(b)
Contingent Reduction of Parachute Payments
(i) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any Payment (as defined below) would be subject to the Excise Tax (as defined below), then Mattel shall pay or provide to the Participant the greatest of the following, whichever gives the Participant the highest net after-tax amount (after taking into account federal, state, local and social security taxes): (1) the Payments or (2) an amount equal to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below). If a reduction in the Plan Payments (as defined below) is necessary so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount and none of the Payments is Nonqualified Deferred Compensation (as defined in Section 5), then the reduction shall occur in the manner a Participant elects in
 
writing prior to the date of payment. If any Payment constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation or a Participant fails to elect an order, then the reduction shall occur in the following order: (i) cancellation of acceleration of vesting on any equity awards for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying equity; (ii) reduction in the benefits described in Section 3(c)(vi) and (vii) (with such reduction being applied to the benefits in the manner having the least economic impact to the Participant and, to the extent the economic impact is equivalent, such benefits shall be reduced in the reverse order of when the benefits would have been provided to the Participant, that is, benefits payable later shall be reduced before benefits payable earlier); (iii) reduction of cash payments (with such reduction being applied to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments); (iv) cancellation of acceleration of vesting of equity awards not covered under (i) above; provided, however, that in the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be cancelled, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of such equity awards, that is, later equity awards shall be canceled before earlier equity awards.
(ii) All determinations required to be made under this Section 4(b), including whether and when Plan Payments are to be reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount and the amount of such reduction and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by a Participant (the "") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to Mattel and the Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by Mattel. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Mattel. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Mattel and the Participant. The Participant shall cooperate, to the extent his or her reasonable out-of pocket expenses are reimbursed by Mattel, with any reasonable requests by Mattel in connection with any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the Excise Tax.
Accounting Firm
(iii) The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 4(b).
(I) A "" shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to this Plan (disregarding this Section 4(b)).
Plan Payment
(II) "" shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax.
Excise Tax
(III) "" of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
Parachute Value
 
(IV) A "" shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of a Participant, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise.
Payment
(V) The "" shall mean the maximum Parachute Value of all Payments that a Participant can receive without any Payments being subject to the Excise Tax.
Safe Harbor Amount
 
(a) Mattel intends that the reimbursements, payments and benefits to which a Participant could become entitled under this Plan be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 5 shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of this Plan as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intention. If Mattel believes, at any time, that any of such reimbursement, payment or benefit is not exempt or does not so comply, Mattel will promptly advise the Participant and will reasonably and in good faith amend the terms of such arrangement such that it is exempt or complies (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Participant and on Mattel) or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section 409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable. Mattel agrees that it will not, without a Participant's prior written consent, knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any action, other than as required by law, that would result in the imposition of tax, interest and/or penalties upon the Participant under Section 409A, unless such action or omission is pursuant to the Participant's written request.
(b) To the extent applicable, each and every payment to be made pursuant to Section 3 of this Plan shall be treated as a separate payment and not as one of a series of payments treated as a single payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).
(c) If a Participant is a "specified employee" (determined by Mattel in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)) as of the date that the Participant experiences a Separation from Service, and if any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Plan or otherwise both (i) constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("") and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Participant to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then any such reimbursement, payment or benefit that is payable during the first six (6) months following the Participant's Date of Termination shall be paid or provided to the Participant in a lump sum cash payment to be made on the earlier of (x) the Participant's death and (y) the first business day of the seventh (7th) month immediately following the Participant's Separation from Service.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
(d) Except to the extent any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Plan does not constitute Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (as defined in Section 409A) to a Participant during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to the Participant in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under Mattel's health plans), (ii) the reimbursements
 
for expenses for which a Participant is entitled shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(e) Any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under Section 3 hereof or otherwise to be paid or provided due to a Separation from Service that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) will be paid or provided to a Participant only to the extent the expenses are not incurred or the benefits are not provided beyond the last day of the Participant's second taxable year following the Participant's taxable year in which the Separation from Service occurs; provided, however, that Mattel shall reimburse such expenses no later than the last day of the third taxable year following the Participant's taxable year in which the Participant's Separation from Service occurs.
(f) Mattel intends that the definition of Good Reason and the separation-from-service procedures specified in Section 2(i) hereof satisfy the conditions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n)(2) for a termination for Good Reason to be treated as an "involuntary separation from service" for purposes of Section 409A.
(g) Subject to Section 3, any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Plan that constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation due upon a termination of employment shall be paid or provided to a Participant only in the event of a Separation from Service.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3(f) or in a Participant's Letter Agreement, by signing the Letter Agreement, the Participant recognizes and agrees that any prior retention, severance or similar plan of Mattel that might apply to the Participant is hereby revoked and ineffective as to the Participant.
 
In consideration of and as a condition of the receipt of any Severance Benefits by a Participant (other than payment of Accrued Amounts or payment or provision of the Other Benefits), the Participant agrees to the following provisions:
(a) In the Participant's capacity in management, the Participant has had a great deal of exposure and access to a broad variety of commercially valuable proprietary information which is vital to the success of Mattel's business including, by way of illustration, past, current and future products and product concepts, marketing strategies, research and plans and information regarding employees. As a result of the Participant's knowledge of the above information and in consideration for the benefits offered by Mattel under this Plan, the Participant reaffirms and recognizes the Participant's continuing obligations with respect to the use and disclosure of confidential and proprietary information of Mattel pursuant to Mattel's policies as set forth in the most-recent confidentiality and inventions agreement that the Participant has executed with Mattel and by this reference made a part hereof. Pursuant thereto, Mattel shall be entitled to injunctive relief to
 
prevent a threatened misappropriation of one or more of Mattel's trade secrets or to halt an actual misappropriation of such trade secrets. The Participant shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of Mattel all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to Mattel or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Participant during the Participant's employment by Mattel or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be public knowledge. After termination of the Participant's employment with Mattel, the Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of Mattel, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than Mattel and those designated by it. The foregoing shall not apply to any information which Mattel discloses to the public.
(b) If the termination of the Participant's employment occurs prior to a Change of Control, eligibility for Severance Benefits under this Plan is contingent upon the Participant's agreement and compliance with Mattel's requirement that the Participant does not accept employment nor an engagement as a consultant with a competitor within one year following the Date of Termination whereupon such position is comparable to the position the Participant held with Mattel and where the Participant can not reasonably satisfy Mattel that the new employer is prepared to and/or does take adequate steps to preclude and to prevent inevitable disclosure of trade secrets, as prohibited under Mattel's policies with respect to the use and disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, as set forth in the most-recent confidentiality and inventions agreement that the Participant has executed with Mattel and by this reference made a part hereof. If the termination of the Participant's employment occurs prior to a Change of Control and if the Participant accepts employment or a consulting relationship with a competitor within one year following the Date of Termination and such position is comparable to the position the Participant held with Mattel and where the Participant can not reasonably satisfy Mattel that the new employer is prepared to and/or does take adequate steps to preclude and to prevent inevitable disclosure of trade secrets, as prohibited under Mattel's policies with respect to the use and disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, as set forth in the most-recent confidentiality and inventions agreement that the Participant has executed with Mattel and by this reference made a part hereof, then no further payments nor eligibility for benefits continuation will be available to the Participant as of the date the Participant commences such employment/consulting. It is a specific condition of this Plan that for a period of one year following the Date of Termination with respect to a termination of the Participant's employment prior to a Change of Control, the Participant is obligated to immediately notify Mattel as to the specifics of the new position that the Participant is planning to commence as an employee or consultant for any company which is a competitor of Mattel.
(c) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Date of Termination, the Participant will not participate in recruiting any of Mattel's employees or in the solicitation of Mattel's employees other than the Participant's assistant on the Date of Termination, and the Participant will not communicate to any other person or entity, about the nature, quality or quantity of work, or any special knowledge or personal characteristics of any person employed by Mattel. If the Participant should wish to discuss possible employment with any then-current Mattel employee other than the Participant's assistant on the Date of Termination during the twelve (12) month period set forth above, the Participant may request written permission to do so from the senior human resources officer of Mattel who may, in his or her discretion, grant a written exception to the no solicitation agreement set forth above, provided, however, the Participant will not discuss any such employment possibility with such employees prior to securing Mattel's permission. If Mattel
 
should decline to grant such permission, the Participant will not at any time, either during or after the non-solicitation period set forth above, advise the employee concerned that he or she was the subject of a request under this paragraph or that Mattel refused to grant the Participant the right to discuss an employment possibility with him/her.
(d) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Date of Termination, (i) the Participant shall not make or encourage or induce others to make statements or representations that disparage or otherwise impair the reputation, goodwill or commercial interests of Mattel or any of its affiliated entities or its or their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products and (ii) Mattel shall not issue any press release or other official, written statement that disparages or otherwise impairs the Participant's business reputation. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements in connection with required governmental testimony or filings, or judicial, administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions or testimony in connection with such proceedings).
(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Mattel's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 7 would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, Mattel, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
 
(a)
Disputes
If any person (claimant) believes that Severance Benefits are being denied improperly, that this Plan is not being operated properly, or that the claimant's legal rights are being violated with respect to this Plan, the claimant must file a claim with the Plan Administrator within the time period set forth in Section 8(b). The Plan Administrator will handle all such claims in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8(c). This requirement applies to all claims that any claimant has with respect to this Plan, except to the extent the Plan Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, that it does not have the power to grant all relief reasonably being sought by the claimant.
(b)
Time for Filing Claims
A claim must be filed within ninety (90) days after the date the claimant first knew or should have known of the facts on which the claim is based, unless Mattel in writing consents otherwise.

(c)
Procedures
If the Plan Administrator does not offer a Participant the payment of Severance Benefits under this Plan within ten (10) days after the Participant terminates employment, the Participant must file a claim for benefits on a form prescribed by the Plan Administrator and within
 
the time frame set forth in subsection 8(b) above. If the claimant's claim for a benefit is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator will furnish the claimant with a written notice of the denial. This written notice must be provided to the claimant within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of the claimant's claim by the Plan Administrator (generally within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Plan Administrator of the claimant's claim for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, in which case a period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt by the Plan Administrator of the claimant's claim for review). If such an extension of time is required, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial ninety (90) day period, and will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension. Written notice of denial of the claimant's claim must contain the following information:
(i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial;
(ii) a specific reference to those provisions of this Plan on which such denial is based;
(iii) a description of any additional information or material necessary to perfect the claimant's claim, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(iv) a copy of the appeals procedures under this Plan and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("") following an adverse determination of the claimant's claim.
ERISA
If the claimant's claim has been denied, and the claimant wishes to submit his or her request for a review of his or her claim, the claimant must follow the following Claims Review Procedure:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The procedure set forth in this Section 8(c) is intended to comply with United States Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 and should be construed in accordance with such regulation. In no event shall the claims procedure be interpreted as expanding the rights of a Participant beyond what is required by United States Department of Labor Regulation
Section 2560.503-1.
 
(a)
Discretion
Mattel's Compensation Committee is responsible for the general administration and management of this Plan ("") and shall have all powers and duties necessary to fulfill its responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the discretion to interpret and apply the provisions of this Plan and to determine all questions relating to eligibility for Plan benefits. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to interpret or construe ambiguous, unclear, or implied (but omitted) terms in any fashion it deems to be appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion, and to make any findings of fact needed in the administration of this Plan. The validity of any such interpretation, construction, decision, or finding of fact shall be given de novo review if challenged in court, by arbitration, or in any other forum, and such de novo standard shall apply notwithstanding the grant of full discretion hereunder to the Plan Administrator or characterization of any such decision by the Plan Administrator as final or binding on any party.
Plan Administrator
(b)
Finality of Determinations
Subject to the last sentence of Section 9(a), all actions taken and all determinations by the Plan Administrator will be final and binding on all persons claiming any interest in or under this Plan. To the extent the Plan Administrator has been granted discretionary authority under this Plan, the Plan Administrator's prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its
 
authority in a like fashion thereafter.
 
Except as provided herein, Mattel's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Plan and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including without limitation any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which Mattel may have against a Participant or others. Mattel agrees to pay, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which a Participant may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by Mattel or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Plan unless there is no reasonable basis for the Participant's claim; provided, that, in the case of expenses relating to a claim by a Participant that he or she terminated for Good Reason or that the termination for Cause was improper, such fees and expenses shall be paid only if a Participant prevails in whole or in part. If there is any dispute over whether a reasonable basis for the Participant's claim exists for purposes of the preceding sentence, the dispute shall be resolved by an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of Section 11. In the event that a Participant shall in good faith give a Notice of Termination for Good Reason and it shall thereafter be determined that Good Reason did not exist, the employment of the Participant shall, unless Mattel and the Participant shall otherwise mutually agree, be deemed to have terminated at the Date of Termination specified in such purported Notice of Termination by mutual consent of Mattel and the Participant and thereupon, the Participant shall be entitled to receive only those payments and benefits which he or she would have been entitled to receive at such date.
 
(a) Subject to the Participant's exhaustion of the administrative remedies under Section 8 with respect to any claim brought by a Participant for any benefits under this Plan, any disputes, controversies or claims which arise out of or relate to this Plan, the Participant's employment or the termination of his or her employment, including, but not limited to, any claim relating to the purported validity, interpretation, enforceability or breach of this Plan, and/or any other claim or controversy arising out of the relationship between the Participant and Mattel (or the nature of the relationship) or the continuation or termination of that relationship, including, but not limited to, claims that a termination was for Cause, or for Good Reason, claims for breach of covenant, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful termination, breach of contract, or intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, breach of right of privacy, interference with advantageous or contractual relations, fraud, conspiracy or other tort or property claims of any kind, which are not settled by agreement between Mattel and the Participant, shall be settled by arbitration under the labor arbitration rules of the JAMS/Endispute (or any other mutually agreed arbitrator) before a board of three arbitrators, as selected thereunder.
One arbitrator shall be selected by the Participant, one by Mattel and the third by the two persons so selected, all in accordance with the labor arbitration rules of the JAMS/Endispute then in effect. In the event that the arbitrator selected by the Participant and the arbitrator selected by Mattel are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator, then the third arbitrator shall be selected from a list of seven provided by the office of JAMS/Endispute nearest to the Participant's residence with Mattel and the Participant striking names in order and the party striking first to be determined by the flip of a coin. The arbitration shall be held in a location to be mutually agreed upon by Mattel and
 
the Participant. In the absence of agreement, the Chairman of the Board of Mattel shall determine the location.
(b) In consideration of the agreement to submit to arbitration all disputes with regard to this Plan and/or with regard to any alleged contract, or any other claim arising out of their conduct, the relationship existing hereunder or the continuation or termination of that relationship, and in further consideration of the anticipated expedition and the minimizing of expense resulting from this arbitration remedy, the arbitration provisions of this Plan shall provide the exclusive remedy, and Mattel and the Participant expressly waive any right he or she or it may have to seek redress in any other forum.
(c) Any claim which either party has against the other party which could be submitted for resolution pursuant to this Section 11 must be presented in writing by the claiming party to the other within one year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim, except that claims arising out of or related to the termination of a Participant's employment must be presented by him or her within one year after the Date of Termination. Unless the party against whom any claim is asserted waives the time limits set forth above, any claim not brought within the time periods specified shall be waived and forever barred.
(d) Mattel will pay all costs and expenses of the arbitration.
(e) Any decision and award or order of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon Mattel and the Participant and judgment thereon may be entered in the Superior Court of the State of California or any other court having jurisdiction.
(f) Each of the above terms and conditions of this Section 11 shall have separate validity and the invalidity of any part thereof shall not affect the remaining parts.
 
(a) Mattel, acting through its Board or Compensation Committee, has the right in its sole and absolute discretion to amend this Plan, to extend its term, or to terminate this Plan, prospectively; provided, however, this Plan may not be amended by the Board or the Compensation Committee in any manner which is materially adverse to any Participant without such Participant's written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Plan shall not be effective with respect to a Participant prior to the expiration of the Participant's status as a "Participant" in the Plan in accordance with the Participant's Letter Agreement without the Participant's written consent.
(b) This Plan shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the service of Mattel, and shall not interfere with or restrict the right of Mattel to discharge or retire the employee for any lawful reason.
 
This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Mattel and its successors. Mattel shall require any successor to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Mattel, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock, or otherwise, expressly to
 
assume and agree to perform this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent as Mattel would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
 
This Plan is intended to be an unfunded "top-hat" welfare plan, within the meaning of U.S. Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104-24 and shall be interpreted, administered, and enforced in accordance with ERISA. It is expressly intended that ERISA preempt the application of state laws to this Plan, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 514 of ERISA. To the extent that state law is applicable, the statutes and common laws of the State of California (excluding its choice of laws principles) shall apply.
 
All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing; shall be delivered by hand delivery to the other party, by recognized overnight commercial courier or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; shall be deemed delivered upon actual receipt (or refusal of receipt); and shall be addressed as follows:
If to Mattel:
MATTEL, INC.
333 Continental Blvd.
El Segundo, CA 90245
Attention: Chief Executive Officer
If to a Participant:
to the last address shown on the payroll records of Mattel
or to such other address as either Mattel or the Participant shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith. Any termination of a Participant's employment by Mattel or by a Participant for Good Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with this Section 15. The failure by a Participant or Mattel to set forth in such Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Participant or Mattel hereunder or preclude the Participant or Mattel from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Participant's or Mattel's rights hereunder.
 
Where the context so indicates, the singular will include the plural and vice versa. Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Plan. Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, a reference to a statute or document shall be construed as referring to any subsequently enacted, adopted, or executed counterpart.

("") and its respective predecessors, successors, assigns, owners, attorneys, representatives, affiliates, Mattel corporations, subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned), divisions, partners and their officers, directors, agents, employees, servants, executors, administrators, accountants, investigators, insurers, and any and all other related individuals and entities, if any, and each of them (collectively, the ""), in any and all capacities from any and all claims, debts, liabilities, demands, obligations, liens, promises, acts, agreements, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to attorneys' fees), damages, actions and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the hire, employment, remuneration (including salary; bonus; incentive or other compensation; vacation, sick leave or medical insurance benefits; or other benefits) or termination of the Participant's employment with Mattel.

Released Parties
2. This release ("") includes a release of any rights or claims the Participant may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits age discrimination in employment as to individuals forty years of age and older; the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, which prohibits discrimination against older workers in all executive benefits; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex; the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, pregnancy-related condition, marital status, age or sexual orientation; the Equal Pay Act, which prohibits paying men and women unequal pay for equal work; the American with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities; or any other federal, state or local laws or regulations which prohibit employment discrimination, restrict an employer's right to terminate the Participant, or otherwise regulate employment. This Release also includes a release by the Participant of any claims for breach of contract, wrongful discharge and all claims for alleged physical or personal injury, emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Participant's employment with Mattel or the termination of that employment; any claims under the WARN Act or any similar law, which requires, among other things, that advance notice be given of certain work force reductions; and all claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, such as claims relating to pension or health plan benefits.
Release
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Release, this Release does not apply to any rights or claims which arise after the execution of this Release.
4. This Release covers both claims that the Participant knows about and those the Participant may not know about. The Participant expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute (such as Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California) which limits the effect of a release
 
with respect to unknown claims. The Participant understands the significance of the Participant's release of unknown claims and the Participant's waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (such as under Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows:
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, the Participant expressly acknowledges that this Release is intended to include both claims that the Participant knows about and those the Participant does not know or suspect to exist.
5. The Participant hereby represents and warrants that he or she has not filed, initiated, or prosecuted (or caused to be filed, initiated, or prosecuted) any lawsuit, complaint, charge, action, compliance review, investigation, or proceeding with respect to any claim this Release purports to waive, and the Participant covenants never to do so in the future, whether as a named plaintiff, class member, or otherwise. The Participant understands that this Release does not require him/her to withdraw, or prohibit him/her from filing, a charge with any government agency (such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), as long as the Participant does not personally seek reinstatement, damages, remedies, or other relief as to any claim that the Participant released by signing this Release, as the Participant has waived any right the Participant might have had to any of those things.
If the Participant is ever awarded or recovers any amount as to a claim the Participant purported to waive in this Release, the Participant agrees that the amount of the award or recovery shall be reduced by the amounts he or she was paid under this Plan, increased appropriately for the time value of money, using an interest rate of 10% per annum. The Participant covenants never directly or indirectly to bring or participate in an action against any Released Party under California Business & Professions Code Section 17200 or under any other unfair competition law of any jurisdiction.
6. The provisions of this Release are severable, and if any part of it is found to be unenforceable, the other paragraphs shall remain fully valid and enforceable. This Release shall be construed in accordance with its fair meaning and in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.
7. The Participant is strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney before signing this Release. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant has been advised of this right to consult an attorney and the Participant understands that whether to do so is the Participant's decision. The Participant acknowledges that Mattel has advised the Participant that the Participant has twenty-one (21) days in which to consider whether the Participant should sign this Release and has advised the Participant that if the Participant signs this Release, the Participant has seven (7) days following the date on which the Participant signs the Release to revoke it and that the Release will not be effective until after this seven-day period had lapsed.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, the Participant expressly acknowledges that this Release is intended to include both claims that the Participant knows about and those the Participant does not know or suspect to exist.
5. The Participant hereby represents and warrants that he or she has not filed, initiated, or prosecuted (or caused to be filed, initiated, or prosecuted) any lawsuit, complaint, charge, action, compliance review, investigation, or proceeding with respect to any claim this Release purports to waive, and the Participant covenants never to do so in the future, whether as a named plaintiff, class member, or otherwise. The Participant understands that this Release does not require him/her to withdraw, or prohibit him/her from filing, a charge with any government agency (such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), as long as the Participant does not personally seek reinstatement, damages, remedies, or other relief as to any claim that the Participant released by signing this Release, as the Participant has waived any right the Participant might have had to any of those things.
If the Participant is ever awarded or recovers any amount as to a claim the Participant purported to waive in this Release, the Participant agrees that the amount of the award or recovery shall be reduced by the amounts he or she was paid under this Plan, increased appropriately for the time value of money, using an interest rate of 10% per annum. The Participant covenants never directly or indirectly to bring or participate in an action against any Released Party under California Business & Professions Code Section 17200 or under any other unfair competition law of any jurisdiction.
6. The provisions of this Release are severable, and if any part of it is found to be unenforceable, the other paragraphs shall remain fully valid and enforceable. This Release shall be construed in accordance with its fair meaning and in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.
7. The Participant is strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney before signing this Release. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant has been advised of this right to consult an attorney and the Participant understands that whether to do so is the Participant's decision. The Participant acknowledges that Mattel has advised the Participant that the Participant has twenty-one (21) days in which to consider whether the Participant should sign this Release and has advised the Participant that if the Participant signs this Release, the Participant has seven (7) days following the date on which the Participant signs the Release to revoke it and that the Release will not be effective until after this seven-day period had lapsed.
 
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS.
