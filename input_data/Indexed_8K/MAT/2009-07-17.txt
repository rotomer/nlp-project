Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 17, 2009, Mattel issued a press release regarding its second quarter 2009 financial results, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. This exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
In its second quarter 2009 press release, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful. A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is provided in Exhibit II to the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 in this Form 8-K.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Second Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif., July 17, 2009  Mattel, Inc. (NYSE: MAT) today reported 2009 second quarter financial results. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $21.5 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to last year's second quarter net income of $11.8 million, or $0.03 per share.
"In light of the challenging global economy, the quarter's results met our expectations, with revenues negatively impacted largely by our lack of toys based on summer entertainment properties as well as foreign exchange rates," said Robert A. Eckert, chairman and chief executive officer of Mattel. "That said, we are pleased with our ability to deliver on what is in our control, including tightly managing expenses, which has resulted in improved margins, profitability and cash flow for the quarter."
Financial Overview
For the quarter, net sales were $898.2 million, down 19 percent compared to $1.11 billion last year, including unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates of 5 percentage points. On a regional basis, second quarter gross sales decreased 12 percent in the U.S. and decreased 26 percent in international markets, including unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates of 10 percentage points.
