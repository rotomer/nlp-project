On February 28, 2011, pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") Guidelines Concerning Rule 10b5-1(c) Individual Trading Plans (the "Guidelines"), Thomas A. Debrowski, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations, entered into a Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plan (the "Plan") with a broker to sell up to 40,000 shares of Mattel stock acquired upon the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units under the 2008-2010 Long-Term Incentive Program.
In accordance with Mattel's Guidelines, the first sales under the Plan may not take place until March 30, 2011, which is the first business day that is at least 30 days after the date upon which Mr. Debrowski adopted the Plan. Mr. Debrowski may sell shares of Mattel stock under the Plan through the close of trading on February 27, 2012, at which time the Plan will terminate.
Transactions under the Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Plan was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Mattel's Guidelines.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
