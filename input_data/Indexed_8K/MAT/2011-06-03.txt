On May 27, 2011 and May 31, 2011, pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel" or the "Company") Guidelines Concerning Rule 10b5-1(c) Individual Trading Plans (the "Guidelines"), the following executives of Mattel each entered into separate individual Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plans (individually, a "Plan", and collectively, the "Plans") with a broker to sell shares of Mattel stock to be acquired upon exercise of employee stock options (the "Options") or to sell shares of Mattel stock acquired upon the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units under the 2008-2010 Long-Term Incentive Program. The Options have a ten year term and will expire in 2012, 2013 or 2014. According to Mattel's Guidelines, the first sales under the Plans may not take place until June 30, 2011, which is at least 30 days after the date each executive adopted his or her plan:
 
The transactions under each Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with the requirements of Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Plan was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Mattel's Guidelines.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time and better manage the exercise of stock options.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
