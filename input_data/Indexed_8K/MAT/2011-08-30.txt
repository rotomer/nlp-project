On August 25, 2011, pursuant to the Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") Guidelines Concerning Rule 10b5-1(c) Individual Trading Plans (the "Guidelines"), Robert A. Eckert, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Mattel, entered into a Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plan (the "Plan") with a broker to sell up to 350,000 shares of Mattel stock to be acquired upon the exercise of an employee stock option (the "Option"). The Option was granted to Mr. Eckert on May 22, 2002 and has a 10-year term that will expire on May 22, 2012.
The first sales under the Plan will not take place until February 2, 2012, which is longer than the 30-day waiting period required by Mattel's Guidelines. Mr. Eckert may sell shares of Mattel stock under the Plan through the close of trading on May 22, 2012, at which time the Plan will terminate.
Transactions under the Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Plan was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Mattel's Guidelines.
Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not aware of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
