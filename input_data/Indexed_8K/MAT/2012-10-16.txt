Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 16, 2012, Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel" or "the Company") issued a press release regarding its third quarter 2012 financial results, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. This exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
In its third quarter 2012 press release, Mattel includes a non-GAAP financial measure, gross sales, which it uses to analyze its operations and to monitor, assess and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Net sales, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Consistent with its segment reporting, Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, business unit, brand and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the detail of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with individual products, making net sales less meaningful. A reconciliation of gross sales to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net sales, is provided in Exhibit II to the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
In the same press release described in Item 2.02 above, Mattel also announced that the Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share on the Company's common stock, to be paid on December 14, 2012 to stockholders of record on November 28, 2012.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Financial Overview
For the quarter, net sales were $2.08 billion, up 4%, including an unfavorable change in currency exchange rates of 3 percentage points. On a regional basis, third quarter gross sales increased 6% in the North American region, which consists of the U.S., Canada and American Girl, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates. For the International region, gross sales increased 2%, including an unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates of 9 percentage points. Operating income for the quarter was $487.4 million, compared to prior year's operating income for the quarter of $397.6 million.
The Company's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 36.3%. For the first nine months of the year, the Company's cash and equivalents declined by approximately $1.09 billion, compared with a decline of approximately $1.03 billion during the same time period last year.
For the first nine months of the year, cash flows used for operating activities were approximately $101 million, a decrease of $221 million compared to approximately $322 million of cash flows used for operating activities in the same period of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to higher net income and lower working capital usage. Cash flows used for investing activities were approximately $833 million, an increase of $714 million, compared to approximately $119 million in 2011, driven primarily by the acquisition of HIT Entertainment. Cash flows used for financing and other activities were approximately $153 million, a decrease of $433 million, compared to approximately $586 million in 2011, primarily due to lower share repurchases and 2011 repayments of long-term debt.
Capital Deployment
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.31 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on December 14, 2012, to stockholders of record on November 28, 2012. The dividend is the final of four quarterly dividends the Company will have paid this year, reflecting an annualized dividend of $1.24 per share, which represents a 35% increase to last year's total dividends. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company repurchased 139,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5 million.
