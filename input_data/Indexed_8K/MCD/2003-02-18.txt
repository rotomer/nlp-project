Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements. Management believes that Systemwide sales information is useful in analyzing the Company's revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent, service fees and/or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments, along with initial fees.
        
McDonald's total Systemwide sales in January 2003 were $3.3 billion, a 5% increase over January 2002. Brand McDonald's comparable sales for the month declined 2.4%

Constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year monthly average exchange rates.
**
Comparable sales represent the change in sales from the same period in the prior year for restaurants in operation at least thirteen months.
