EXHIBIT 99
        
Investor Release
        OAK BROOK, ILMcDonald's Corporation today announced that results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 showed a 7% gain in earnings per share (before the cumulative effect of accounting changes) on higher revenues, although comparable unit sales declined.
        Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Cantalupo said, "I certainly am not satisfied with our results this quarter. Yet, I am confident we are getting the business back on track. We are moving ahead with plans to revitalize McDonald's business everywhere. And we've made a strategic shift to concentrate on building sales at existing restaurants rather than adding new ones. We will continue to take decisive actions to build momentum to deliver results for customers, shareholders, employees and owner/operators."
        Cantalupo reported the following highlights of the latest quarter and McDonald's long-term outlook:
 - 
Diluted earnings per share were 29 cents, up 7% before the cumulative effect of accounting changes (flat in constant currencies).
 - 
Revenues increased 6% to $3.8 billion (1% in constant currencies).
 - 
Systemwide sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion (flat in constant currencies).
 - 
Comparable unit sales were 2.0% lower among U.S. Brand McDonald's restaurants, and were 3.6% lower on a worldwide basis in constant currencies.
 - 
Capital spending will be reduced by $800 million in 2003 compared with 2002, significantly increasing cash available for debt reduction, dividend increase and share repurchase.
 - 
In the coming 12 to 18 months, plans call for the Company to be well on its way toward a 2005 goal of annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%, operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens.(1)
(1)
Return on incremental invested capital is defined as the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets, and excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
*
Information in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results, except for hyperinflationary economies, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
**
Systemwide sales include sales by all Brand McDonald's and Partner Brand restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements.

        Cantalupo also said, "Over the next 12 to 18 months, we will build a rock-solid foundation that can deliver reliable top-line and bottom-line growth, while moderating our capital spendingthus improving returns on investment. An initial step is the reduction in 2003 capital expenditures to $1.2 billion, down 40% from 2002.
        "This calculated slowing of expansion will be combined with an unprecedented effort to increase sales at our existing restaurants. We intend to achieve our objectives through disciplined action focused on five drivers of superior customer experiencespeople, products, place, price and promotion. The net result should be improved momentum in comparable unit sales, margins and returns. This won't happen overnight. While our first quarter reported sales and operating income grew, constant currency comparable unit sales and operating income declinedaffected by world events and weak economic conditions in many nations, severe winter weather, and the shift in Easter school holidays from March to April in Europe.
        "Nevertheless, we won't allow these short-term factors to stand in our way as we move aggressively to reaffirm McDonald's leadership in marketing and delivering quality food and outstanding service. We have challenged our lead advertising agencies to reinvigorate our marketing and strengthen our traditional appeal with a special focus on young people and women. We also are working on a number of efforts to speed service and to offer product innovations responsive to customer tastes for additional wholesome choices. In the U.S. last week, we nationally launched a new line of Premium Salads served with warm grilled or crispy chicken and Newman's Own salad dressingwith encouraging initial results. We're also adding more choices to Happy Meals. In the U.K., we've introduced no-sugar-added drinks, organic milk and fruit as Happy Meal options. In Australia, kids can now choose a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich, raisins and orange juice.
        "I am confident that our current strategies and more disciplined approach will improve the customer's experience in our restaurants and ultimately increase restaurant cash flow and shareholder value."
OUTLOOK FOR 2003
        The Company is focused on delivering improved results over the long term. As previously announced, the Company will not be providing an earnings per share target by quarter or for the year. Instead, the Company is providing the following outlook on key components influencing earnings per share and will continue to communicate its strategies and priorities as well as actual results throughout the year.
        The information provided below is as of April 2003 and excludes any impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
 - 
McDonald's expects sales from new restaurants to add approximately two to three percentage points to sales growth in 2003. Most of this anticipated growth will be a result of restaurants opened in 2002 rather than in 2003, as the majority of restaurants are opened in the last few months of the year.
In 2002, the Company opened 1,363 traditional restaurants and 392 satellite McDonald's restaurants. Net of closings, worldwide restaurant additions totaled 1,015, with 781 net traditional and 234 net satellite restaurants. In 2003, the Company expects to open about 620 traditional restaurants and 340 satellite McDonald's restaurants, for a total of 960 new restaurants worldwide. Net of planned closings, worldwide restaurant additions are expected to total 360, with 200 net traditional and 160 net satellite restaurants. McDonald's expects new restaurants to add approximately one percentage point to sales growth in 2004.
 - 
Worldwide comparable sales were -2.1% and -1.3% for full years 2002 and 2001. McDonald's strategies for 2003 are designed to reverse the negative comparable sales trend through a heightened focus on restaurant level execution and marketing. Our outlook remains cautious until we see improved performance in our key markets. As a guideline, generally, one percentage point of comparable sales in the U.S. impacts annual earnings per share by 1.5 cents, and one percentage point of comparable sales in Europe impacts annual earnings per share by about one cent, assuming no change in profit margins.
 - 
McDonald's expects the total amount of selling, general & administrative expenses in 2003 to be relatively flat compared with 2002.
 - 
A significant part of McDonald's operating income is from outside the U.S., and more than 60% of total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. The Euro and the British Pound are the most significant currencies impacting our business. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% (compared with 2002 average rates), McDonald's annual reported earnings per share would change by about 4 cents to 5 cents. Through year-to-date March 2003, foreign currency translation benefited diluted earnings per share by $0.02.
 - 
McDonald's expects to decrease its debt level in 2003 by $300 million to $700 million. In December 2002, we moved our fixed percentage of debt from 45% to about 60%. The weighted average interest rate for debt was 4.2% for first quarter 2003.
 - 
McDonald's expects the effective income tax rate for full year 2003 to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%.
 - 
McDonald's expects capital expenditures for 2003 to be $1.2 billion, $800 million less than in 2002. McDonald's also plans to use cash from operations to strengthen the balance sheet by paying down debt ($300 million to $700 million) and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase (combined $500 million to $1 billion).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
OPERATING RESULTS
        The Company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick-service restaurant businesses under the McDonald's brand (McDonald's restaurants). The Company also operates other restaurant concepts under its Partner Brands.
Net Income and Diluted Net Income Per Common Share
        Income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes increased $12.5 million or 4%, and diluted income per common share before the cumulative effect of accounting changes increased $0.02 or 7% for the quarter. First quarter 2002 results included asset impairment charges of $43 million or $.04 per diluted share. Net income, which included the cumulative effect of the accounting changes, increased $74.3 million, and diluted net income per common share increased $0.06 for the quarter.
        Weighted average shares outstanding were lower compared with the prior year due to shares repurchased during 2002. In addition, outstanding stock options had a less dilutive effect than in the prior year.
Impact of Foreign Currencies on Reported Results
        While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald's lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on both the consolidated revenue growth rate and operating income growth rate for the quarter, primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound. The following table presents the effect of foreign currency translation on consolidated reported results for the quarter.
        Benefit of foreign currency translation on consolidated reported results
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes and 2002 Asset Impairment Charges
        Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The Statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. In first quarter 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $36.8 million after tax ($0.03 per diluted share) related to lease obligations in certain international markets to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change.
        Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. As a result of the initial required goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a charge of $98.6 million after tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in first quarter 2002 to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change. The impaired goodwill was primarily in Argentina, Uruguay and other markets in Latin America and the Middle East, where economies had weakened significantly.
        The Company also recorded $43.0 million (pre and after tax) of asset impairment charges in first quarter 2002, primarily related to the impairment of assets in certain existing restaurants in Chile and other Latin American markets and the closing of 32 underperforming restaurants in Turkey, as a result of continued economic weakness.
Systemwide Sales and Revenues
        Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements. Management believes that Systemwide sales information is useful in analyzing the Company's revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent, service fees and/or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. These fees received from franchisees and affiliates along with sales from Company-operated restaurants are reported as revenues.
        Systemwide sales
*
Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results.
n/a
Not applicable
        Systemwide sales and revenues may grow at different rates during a given period, primarily due to a change in the mix of Company-operated, franchised and affiliated restaurants. For example, this mix is impacted by purchases and sales of restaurants between the Company and franchisees. For the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, Company-operated restaurants generated about 30% of Systemwide sales and about 75% of revenues.
        Total revenues

Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results.
n/a
Not applicable
        On a global basis, Systemwide sales and revenues were relatively flat for the quarter in constant currencies as restaurant expansion offset negative comparable sales.
        U.S. sales increased for the quarter due to expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales. U.S. revenues increased at a higher rate than sales for the quarter due to a higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants.
        In Europe, constant currency sales decreased for the quarter due to negative comparable sales, partly offset by expansion. Expansion and slightly positive comparable sales in France were more than offset by negative comparable sales in Germany, where the economy remains weak, and in the U.K., where consumer confidence
continues to decline. Europe's revenue growth rate was lower than the sales growth rate, primarily due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants.
        Constant currency sales results in APMEA declined for the quarter due to negative comparable sales, partly offset by expansion mainly in China. The negative comparable sales in this segment were made worse by changes in consumer behavior as a result of events in the Persian Gulf and, to a lesser extent, concerns about SARS. We expect results in APMEA to continue to be impacted by these issues in the near term.
        In Latin America, constant currency sales increased for the quarter, primarily due to positive comparable sales, despite the impact of the temporary closure of restaurants in Venezuela through mid-February, due to the national strike. Positive comparable sales in Brazil, Puerto Rico and Mexico led the sales results for the segment. Revenues increased at a higher rate than sales for the quarter, partly due to a higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants in 2003.
        The sales and revenue increases in Partner Brands were due to expansion and positive comparable sales at Chipotle Mexican Grill.
Combined Operating Margins
        The following combined operating margin information represents margins for McDonald's restaurant business only and excludes Partner Brands.
        Combined operating margins
        Combined operating margin dollars decreased $17.6 million or 2% for the quarter (8% in constant currencies). The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for more than 80% of the combined margin dollars in both years.
        Consolidated food & paper costs decreased as a percent of sales for the quarter, while payroll costs and occupancy & other operating expenses increased as a percent of sales.
        The U.S. Company-operated margin percent decreased for the quarter, primarily due to negative comparable sales. Food & paper costs, payroll costs and occupancy & other operating expenses all increased as a percent of sales for the quarter.
        The Company-operated margin percent in Europe and APMEA decreased for the quarter, primarily due to negative comparable sales. Payroll and occupancy & other costs as a percent of sales increased for the quarter for both segments. In Latin America, Company-operated margins decreased for the quarter, primarily due to higher commodity and utility costs.
        The decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent for the quarter reflects negative comparable sales, higher short-term financial support to franchisees, primarily in the U.S., and higher occupancy costs due, in part, to an increased proportion of leased sites.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
        Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% for the quarter (flat in constant currencies).
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
        Other operating (income) expense, net
        Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased for the quarter due to a net loss from our Japanese affiliate in 2003 compared with income in 2002. The team service system payments were made to U.S. owner/operators in first quarter 2002 to facilitate the introduction of the team service front counter system.
Operating Income
        Consolidated operating income increased $33.3 million or 5% for the quarter. Results in 2002 included $43.0 million of asset impairment charges.

        U.S. operating income increased 1% for the quarter, primarily due to $21.6 million of payments made to U.S. owner/operators in first quarter 2002 and lower selling, general & administrative expenses, partly offset by lower combined operating margin dollars.
        Europe's operating income decreased 7% for the quarter in constant currencies, primarily due to weak results in Germany and the U.K., partly offset by positive results in France.
        APMEA's adjusted operating income decreased 27% for the quarter in constant currencies, primarily due to weak results in Japan, Australia, China and South Korea.
        Latin America's adjusted operating results declined significantly for the quarter as most markets in the segment continue to experience difficult economic conditions. In addition, Latin America's results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the national strike in Venezuela.
INTEREST, NONOPERATING EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES
        Interest expense increased for the quarter primarily due to stronger foreign currencies and higher average debt levels in first quarter 2003 compared with first quarter 2002. The increase in average debt levels was primarily due to non-cash items, including the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated debt and SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustments.
        Nonoperating expense for the quarter reflected foreign currency translation losses in 2003 compared with foreign currency translation gains in 2002.
        The first quarter effective income tax rate was 33.5% compared with 34.5% in 2002. The higher effective income tax rate in 2002 was due to the asset impairment charges recorded in 2002 that were not tax-effected for financial reporting purposes.
