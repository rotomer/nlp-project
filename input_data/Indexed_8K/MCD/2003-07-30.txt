EXHIBIT 99
OAK BROOK, ILMcDonald's Corporation today reported record second quarter and first half sales spurred by enthusiasm for its new food offerings and improvement in food taste and service initiatives.
        Chairman and CEO Jim Cantalupo said "I'm pleased with the strong customer response to our innovative new products, Happy Meals and value offerings, generating early signs of progress in our U.S. operations. But I'm far from satisfied. This upturn reflects only the beginning of our worldwide revitalization plan to deliver a dramatic new difference in service, taste and relevancewith consistencyin all of our restaurants".
        Cantalupo reported the following highlights of the quarter and first half:
 - 
Revenues rose 11% (5% in constant currencies) to an all-time high for the quarter and increased 8% (3% in constant currencies) for the six months.
 - 
Systemwide sales were up 10% (4% in constant currencies) setting a record for the quarter and up 7% (2% in constant currencies) for the first half.
 - 
Comparable unit sales increased 4.9% for U.S. Brand McDonald's restaurantsthe highest growth rate in five yearsand 1.2% worldwide for the quarter.
 - 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 37 cents vs. 39 cents a year ago; and for the first half were 66 cents for both years before the effect of accounting changes.
*
Information in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results, except for hyperinflationary economies, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. See the table later in this release for a reconciliation of reported results to constant currency results.
**
Systemwide sales include sales by all Brand McDonald's and Partner Brand restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements.

        Cantalupo commented that "While we still have a challenging job ahead of us, important progress is being made to ensure that our restaurants provide an outstanding customer experience. We've implemented value programs in most of our markets, introduced innovative new products like our premium salads with Newman's Own all-natural salad dressings and the McGriddle breakfast concept, and experimented with ideas to expand the experience, like our Wi-Fi laptop wireless internet connections at selected restaurants. And as part of our Healthy Lifestyle Initiative, we're developing additional wholesome menu choices and have partnered with experts in nutrition and fitness. At the same time, we're improving our training programs and quality control systems and are rolling out an exciting new global marketing theme and program in the third quarter.
        "Meanwhile, we have reduced capital spending and eliminated non-essential projects to focus full attention on improving the core business. We are investing in the business through strategic incremental advertising, and managing costs and capital with a focused and disciplined approach. We incurred additional costs this quarter due to our previously announced reduction in openings. Yet, we remain on track to meet our capital spending and selling, general and administrative expense targets for the year.
Around the world, our management teams are aligned with our Plan to Win. They are focused on the drivers of exceptional customer experiencespeople, product, place, price and promotion.
        "This focus drove the U.S. comparable restaurant sales increase of 4.9% this quarterthe highest in five years. In fact, U.S. average sales volumes in June were the second highest in McDonald's history. While we are very pleased with these results, we know we have significant opportunities, especially in the area of serviceour top priority.
        "In Europe, we face economic and other challenges in certain key markets. However, we are confident we are taking the right actions to improve results in this difficult environment. We are offering customers everyday value to address lower consumer spending and more menu variety to become more relevant to customers' changing lifestyles and interests.
        "I'm excited about our plans and opportunities and believe we have just scratched the surface of what we are capable of delivering."
OUTLOOK
        The information provided below is as of July 2003 and excludes any impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
 - 
McDonald's expects sales from new restaurants to add approximately two to three percentage points to sales growth in 2003. Most of this anticipated growth will be a result of restaurants opened in 2002 rather than in 2003.
In 2002, the Company opened 1,363 traditional restaurants and 392 satellite McDonald's restaurants. Net of closings, worldwide restaurant additions totaled 1,015, with 781 net traditional and 234 net satellite restaurants. In 2003, the Company expects to open about 620 traditional restaurants and 340 satellite McDonald's restaurants, for a total of 960 new restaurants worldwide. Net of planned closings, worldwide restaurant additions are expected to total 360, with 200 net traditional and 160 net satellite restaurants. McDonald's expects new restaurants to add approximately one percentage point to sales growth in 2004.
 - 
Worldwide comparable sales were -2.1% and -1.3% for full years 2002 and 2001. McDonald's strategies for 2003 are designed to reverse the negative comparable sales trend through a heightened focus on restaurant-level execution and marketing. Our outlook remains cautious until we see continued improved performance in our key markets. As a guideline, generally, one percentage point of comparable sales in the U.S. impacts annual earnings per share by 1.5 cents, and one percentage point of comparable sales in Europe impacts annual earnings per share by about one cent, assuming no change in profit margins.
 - 
McDonald's expects 2003 selling, general & administrative expenses to be relatively flat in constant currencies compared with 2002.
 - 
A significant part of McDonald's operating income is from outside the U.S., and more than 60% of total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. The Euro and the British Pound are the most significant currencies impacting our business. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% (compared with 2002 average rates), McDonald's annual reported earnings per share would change by about 4 to 5 cents. Through year-to-date June 2003, foreign currency translation benefited diluted earnings per share by 5 cents.
 - 
McDonald's expects to decrease its debt level in 2003 by $300 million to $700 million (as measured in constant currencies). McDonald's fixed percentage of debt was 64% at June 30. The weighted average interest rate for debt was 4.2% for year-to-date June 2003.
 - 
McDonald's expects the effective income tax rate for full year 2003 to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%.
 - 
McDonald's expects capital expenditures for 2003 to be about $1.2 billion in constant currencies.
 - 
McDonald's expects to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase (combined $500 million to $1 billion) in 2003.
 - 
The Company's goals beginning in 2005 include achieving sustainable annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%, operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
OPERATING RESULTS
The Company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick-service restaurant businesses under the McDonald's brand (McDonald's restaurants). The Company also operates other restaurant concepts under its Partner Brands.
Impact of Foreign Currencies on Reported Results
        While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald's lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on the growth rates of consolidated revenue, operating income and earnings per share for the quarter and six months, primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound.
        Information in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because it believes these results better represent the Company's underlying business trends. See the tables later in this release for a reconciliation of reported results to constant currency results.
Net Income and Diluted Net Income Per Common Share
        For the quarter, net income decreased $26.6 million or 5%, and diluted net income per common share decreased $0.02 or 5%.
        For the six months, income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes decreased $14.1 million or 2%, and diluted income per common share before the cumulative effect of accounting changes was flat at $0.66. Net income, including the cumulative effect of the accounting changes, increased $47.7 million or 6% and diluted net income per common share increased $0.05 or 9%.
        Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were lower for both periods compared with the prior year due to a less dilutive effect from outstanding stock options and shares repurchased during 2002.
        In June, the Company repurchased $26.0 million of its common stock.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes
        Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. In first quarter 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $36.8 million after tax ($0.03 per diluted share) related to lease obligations in certain international markets to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change.
        Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. As a result of the initial required goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a charge of $98.6 million after tax ($0.08 per diluted share) in first quarter 2002 to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change. The impaired goodwill was primarily in Argentina, Uruguay and other markets in Latin America and the Middle East, where economies had weakened significantly.
Systemwide Sales and Revenues
        Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements. Management believes that Systemwide sales
information is useful in analyzing the Company's revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent, service fees and/or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. These fees received from franchisees and affiliates along with sales from Company-operated restaurants are reported as revenues.
        Systemwide sales and revenues may grow at different rates during a given period, primarily due to a change in the mix of Company-operated, franchised and affiliated restaurants. For example, this mix is impacted by purchases and sales of restaurants between the Company and franchisees. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, Company-operated restaurants generated about 30% of Systemwide sales and about 75% of revenues.
        Systemwide sales increased 10% for the quarter and 7% for the six months. On a global basis, the increases in Systemwide sales and revenues were due to expansion for the quarter and the six months, and positive comparable sales for the quarter. On a global basis, comparable sales were negative for the six months.
        U.S. sales increased 8% for the quarter and 4% for the six months due to positive comparable sales and expansion. Strong customer response to the new premium salads and McGriddles breakfast sandwiches, popular Happy Meals, continued everyday value and focus on improved food taste and service, all contributed to the sales increases. The strong U.S. comparable sales performance has continued in July. U.S. revenues increased at a higher rate than sales for both periods due to a slightly higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants.
        In Europe, constant currency sales were relatively flat for the quarter and six months as restaurant expansion offset negative comparable sales. Continued negative results in the U.K. and Germany were offset by expansion in France and strong performances in Russia and Spain. Comparable sales trends in Europe continue to be negative in July. Revenues increased at a lower rate than sales for both periods, primarily due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants in 2003.
        Constant currency sales results in APMEA declined 4% for the quarter and the six months due to negative comparable sales in most markets. The segment's decline was driven by weak results in Japan and other key markets, compounded by concerns about SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). We expect the impact of SARS to be less in the second half of the year.
        In Latin America, constant currency sales increased 8% for the quarter and 4% for the six months, primarily due to positive comparable sales in many markets. Revenues increased at a higher rate than sales for both periods, primarily due to a higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants in 2003.
        Partner Brands sales and revenue increased in both periods, due to expansion and positive comparable sales at Chipotle Mexican Grill.
Combined Operating Margins
        The following combined operating margin information represents margins for McDonald's restaurant business only and excludes Partner Brands.
        Combined operating margin dollars increased $98.4 million or 8% for the quarter and $80.8 million or 4% for the six months. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for more than 80% of the combined margin dollars in both periods of 2003 and 2002.
        Consolidated food & paper costs decreased as a percent of sales for both the quarter and six months, while payroll costs and occupancy & other operating expenses increased as a percent of sales for both periods.
        The U.S. Company-operated margin percent increased for the quarter primarily due to positive comparable sales. As a percent of sales, food & paper costs increased, while payroll costs and occupancy & other operating expenses decreased for the quarter. The U.S. Company-operated margin percent decreased for the six months due to an increase in food & paper costs and occupancy & other operating expenses as a percent of sales, partly offset by a decrease in payroll costs as a percent of sales.
        The Company-operated margin percent in Europe declined for the quarter and six months. Payroll and occupancy & other operating expenses as a percent of sales increased for both periods, partly offset for the six months by lower food and paper costs as a percent of sales.
        The decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent for the quarter and six months reflects higher occupancy costs due, in part, to an increased proportion of leased sites, partly offset by positive comparable sales for the quarter.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
        Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 16% for the quarter and 10% for the six months partly due to approximately $14 million in severance costs, primarily associated with streamlining restaurant development functions, and $11 million of incremental marketing. In addition, stronger foreign currencies impacted selling, general & administrative expenses by $17.9 million for the quarter and $29.6 million for the six months, contributing to the increases.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net
        Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased for the quarter and six months due to weaker results from our Japanese affiliate in 2003. Other expense increased for both periods primarily due to about $25 million of costs in the U.S. as a result of management's decision to significantly reduce capital expenditures.
Operating Income
        Consolidated operating income decreased $19.0 million or 2% for the quarter, and increased $14.3 million or 1% for the six months.
        U.S. operating income decreased 3% for the quarter and 1% for the six months. Higher combined operating margin dollars were more than offset by higher selling, general & administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses for both periods.
        Europe's operating income decreased 7% for both periods in constant currencies, primarily due to continued weak results in the U.K. and Germany.
        APMEA's operating income decreased 43% for the quarter and 28% for the six months in constant currencies, primarily due to continued weak results in most markets. Results for the six months 2002 include $15.9 million of asset impairment charges in Turkey.
        Latin America's operating results declined significantly for the quarter and six months as most markets in the segment continue to experience difficult economic conditions. In addition, Latin America's results for the six months were negatively impacted by the national strike in Venezuela. Results for the six months 2002 include $27.1 million of asset impairment charges.
INTEREST, NONOPERATING EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES
        Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months primarily due to stronger foreign currencies.
        Nonoperating expense for the quarter reflected lower foreign currency translation losses in 2003 compared with 2002, while the six months reflected higher foreign currency translation losses in 2003 compared with 2002.
        The effective income tax rate for both periods in 2003 was 33.5% compared with 32.0% for second quarter 2002 and 33.0% for the six months 2002.
