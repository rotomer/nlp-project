Exhibit 99
OAK BROOK, IL
Jim Cantalupo, McDonald's Chairman and CEO, today announced another step in the company's revitalization plan. In a move consistent with the company's objective to do fewer things better to drive long-term growth in sales and operating income, McDonald's will significantly narrow its non-McDonald's brand activity by focusing on the U.S. development of Chipotle and Boston Market, concepts that are operating profitably.
Regarding the other restaurant concepts in McDonald's portfolio, Cantalupo announced the following decisions:
 - 
McDonald's has agreed on the sale of Donatos Pizzeria back to its founder.
 - 
McDonald's will discontinue its development of non-McDonald's brands outside the U.S. This decisionaffecting Boston Market in Canada and Australia, and Donatos Pizzeria in Germanyreflects management's desire to remain sharply focused on revitalizing sales and service at McDonald's 17,000 restaurants outside the U.S.
 - 
McDonald's will retain its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan will close its Pret units there, as previously announced.
 - 
McDonald's has entered into a letter of intent to exit its domestic joint venture with Fazoli's.
Cantalupo said these decisions achieve several objectives, including eliminating distracting and unprofitable operations, reallocating resources to McDonald's restaurants, and providing a more focused growth platform for Chipotle and Boston Market.
"We will begin 2004 with a clear direction for what we need to do with these brands," Cantalupo said. "We will concentrate our efforts primarily on Chipotle and Boston Market in the United States, concepts that have potential for long-term growth and benefit to McDonald's. These two brands are sizeable companies that can operate autonomously. We believe this new focus and discipline makes the most sense for our company, our shareholders and our ongoing business momentum.
"As previously announced, Mats Lederhausen will lead these efforts as Managing Director of McDonald's Ventures. I have asked Mats to set goals for the next few years which will focus on several entrepreneurial objectives. First, continue to develop these concepts independently, without significant resource investment by McDonald's. Next, determine the ultimate level and significance to McDonald's income growth. Third, assess whether these concepts have the unit economics to support franchising. Finally, leverage learnings that can be adapted for innovations in McDonald's restaurants."
Concerning these objectives, Lederhausen said, "Charting this course is the right thing to do as we work to maximize shareholder value and minimize distractions. Boston Market and Chipotle have demonstrated the strongest potential to add growth to our bottom line. We will continue to develop these concepts and work to achieve greater profitability."
McDonald's expects to record after-tax charges of 2328 per share in the fourth quarter. These charges primarily relate to the actions surrounding the restaurant concepts described above. The remainder relates to annual asset impairment testing and other revitalization plan actions. Substantially all of the charges are non-cash, and not all are tax deductible.
McDonald's is the world's leading food service retailer with more than 30,000 local McDonald's restaurants serving 47 million customers each day in more than 100 countries. More than 70 percent of McDonald's restaurants around the world are owned and operated by independent, local businessmen and women.
