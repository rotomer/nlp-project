EXHIBIT 99
 
Investor Release
 
 OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced that it generated a record $3.3 billion of cash from operations in 2003. Increased sales at existing restaurants drove the record cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2003 were $1.3 billion, $700 million less than 2002. In 2003, $617 million was invested in new restaurants, $564 million was reinvested in existing restaurants, and $126 million was invested in technology and other expenditures. By segment, capital expenditures were $482 million in the U.S., $405 million in Europe, and $122 million in APMEA in 2003.
   
 Jim Cantalupo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The revitalization work we have done so far has paid off in increased sales and cash flow at existing restaurants and better restaurant experiences for our customers. The combination of increased cash generation and lower capital expenditures allowed us to strengthen our financial position and return cash to shareholders. We paid down about $900 million of debt in 2003, compared with incremental borrowings of about $150 million in 2002. In 2003, we also increased our annual dividend 70 percent to about $500 million and returned additional cash to shareholders by repurchasing about $400 million of common stock.
   
 "Our revitalization efforts in 2004 will build on the momentum created last year. We will continue to focus on the customer, improve the restaurant experience and exercise financial discipline. These steps should help us meet our goals for 2005 and beyond of annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5%, operating income growth of 6 to 7% and return on incremental invested capital in the high teens."
