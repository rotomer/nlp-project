EXHIBIT 99
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - Charlie Bell, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our customer-focused Plan to Win continues to drive sales increases. Global comparable sales were up 3.9% in August - our 16
th
consecutive monthly increase. Systemwide sales at all McDonald's restaurants increased 8.6%, or 4.6% in constant currencies.
"In the U.S., our momentum continued as improved service, expanded menu choice and variety, including the recent launch of our premium Chicken Selects, and leadership marketing gave more customers more reasons to visit McDonald's. Comparable sales were up 7.2% in August - an impressive figure on top of the 8.8% comparable sales increase last year.
"In Europe, we're making progress revitalizing our business as evidenced by the 3.1% increase in year-to-date comparable sales versus the 2.1% decline for the same period in 2003. Europe's August comparable sales were down slightly due to weak performance in Germany, as well as poor weather and a decline in tourism across the continent. Our Salads Plus menu continued to perform well, with increased momentum in several markets contributing to top line sales and restaurant cash flow.
"Looking ahead, our goal remains the same: deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. We will achieve this objective by sticking with our Plan to Win, which is completely focused on satisfying customers."
