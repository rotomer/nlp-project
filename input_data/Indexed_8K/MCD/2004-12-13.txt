Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 9, 2004, McDonald's Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release reporting the Company's November 2004 sales and other items. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99 and is attached hereto.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that November 2004 Systemwide sales for McDonald's restaurants increased 9.3%, or 5.1% in constant currencies, compared with November 2003. Comparable sales for McDonald's restaurants worldwide increased 4.2% for the month.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "
In November, our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and leadership marketing continued to deliver results.
McDonald's is attracting more customers and building on our ongoing sales momentum. The U.S. marked its 20
th
consecutive month of positive comparable sales, reporting an increase of 7.1% for November against last year's outstanding 10.2% result. Our performance in the U.S. continues to be driven by multiple c omplimentary initiatives including new food, expanded restaurant hours, everyday
value, appealing Happy Meals and better operations.
"Europe's comparable sales rose 1.1% in November despite a negative calendar shift. In the face of Europe's challenging business climate, year-to-date comparable sales were up 2.4%. To gain more traction and grow our business in Europe, we will continue to focus on delivering outstanding everyday value and superior service along with contemporary and relevant food offerings.
"In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comparable sales were relatively flat for November, reflecting a negative calendar shift.
"
As we approach 2005, we will continue to execute our Plan to Win and maintain financial discipline to attract more customers, create greater brand loyalty and grow profitably.
"
During the fourth quarter, McDonald's will complete its annual asset impairment testing. The Company expects to record charges of approximately $95 million to
$110 million ($85 million to $100 million after tax or $0.07 to $0.08 per share), primarily related to asset impairment in South Korea. These charges will not result in future cash expenditures.
Separately, the Company will record a gain of nearly $50 million 
($30 million after tax or $0.02 per share for the quarter) in non-operating income as a result of the December sale of its interest in a U.S. partnership that owned real estate in downtown Chicago.
