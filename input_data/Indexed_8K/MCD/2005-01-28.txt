 McDonald's Corporation today announced strong operating results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter and $1.79 for the year, both up significantly over 2003 on strong comparable sales and higher margins.
OAK BROOK, IL
 
Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "From a financial perspective, 2004 was a tremendous year for McDonald's. Through our strategic focus on operational excellence in our restaurants, and leadership marketing that continues to connect with consumers, we increased the number of customers served per day by 1.6 million. Comparable sales were positive across all geographic segments during each and every quarter, and we delivered double-digit growth in sales and operating income for the year. Each of these accomplishments validates the strength of our Plan to Win and demonstrates the power of growing by being better not just bigger."
 
McDonald's reported the following fourth quarter highlights:

Jim Skinner continued, "Our consolidated performance continues to reflect the underlying strength of our U.S. business, which generated impressive sales and margin improvements for the second consecutive year. Despite economic challenges in certain key European markets, our 2.4% comparable sales increase for the year indicates that we are building momentum and making progress revitalizing this important business segment. To date in January, U.S. sales remain strong, and Europe's sales trends have strengthened. France, Germany and the U.K. are each showing positive comparable sales for the first three weeks of the month, with the introduction of a new every day value strategy contributing strongly to Germany's sales performance.
 
"As we begin the New Year, we remain intensely focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience and maintaining fiscal discipline. Our average annual targets for 2005 and beyond remain unchanged: Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%, annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. Ongoing discipline in the use of our significant and growing free cash flow will help further enhance shareholder value. In 2005, we expect to add approximately 350 net new McDonald's restaurants and will continue reimaging to keep our restaurants fresh, contemporary and in-tune with customers' lifestyles.
 
"Separately, in light of Chipotle Mexican Grill's strong performance and growing popularity, we plan to explore strategic alternatives to fuel growth at this emerging, fast-casual brand which currently operates more than 400 restaurants. We believe Chipotle's value and potential might be maximized through alternative strategies that could include raising additional equity capital in the public or private markets. This would have an additional benefit of enabling us to allocate more resources to growing sales and profits at existing McDonald's restaurants.
 
"In April, we will celebrate McDonald's 50th anniversary. It is an honor and a privilege to serve as McDonald's Chief Executive Officer as we cross this important milestone. While we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead, we can also look back with pride on the progress we have made over the past 50 years. As we embark on our next 50 years in business, we remain intent on providing each of the more than 48 million customers we serve each day with a great McDonald's experience."
 
Like other companies in the restaurant industry, McDonald's recently reviewed its accounting practices with respect to leasing transactions. Following this review and in consultation with its external auditors, McDonald's has corrected an error in its practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight-line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property. The result of the correction is primarily to accelerate the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed-rent escalations by revising the computation of straight-line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods. As the correction relates solely to accounting treatment, it does not affect McDonald's historical or future cash flow or the timing of payments under the related leases and its effect on the Company's full year earnings per share, cash from operations and shareholders' equity is immaterial. Adjustments of $20.8 million pretax ($13.0 million after tax or $0.01 per share) for the current year and $139.1 million pretax ($91.5 million after tax or $0.07 per share) for prior periods are recorded in the current quarter. These adjustments primarily impact the U.S., China, Boston Market and Chipotle. Other markets were less significantly impacted, as many of the leases outside of the U.S. do not contain fixed-rent escalations.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants.

The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and year. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates.
