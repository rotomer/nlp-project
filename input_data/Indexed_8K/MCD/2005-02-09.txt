EXHIBIT 99
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that global Systemwide sales for McDonald's restaurants increased 8.3% in January, 6.3% in constant currencies, compared with January 2004. Comparable sales for McDonald's restaurants worldwide increased 5.2%.
 McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "We're off to a good start in 2005 with comparable sales up 4.1% in the U.S. and 5.4% in Europe against tough prior year comparisons of 13.4% and 6.5%, respectively. Our performance in the U.S. continues to reflect the vitality of our menu, service and marketing initiatives along with our strategic focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience.
   
 "Europe's January Systemwide sales rose 11.6%, 6.9% in constant currencies, reflecting strong contributions from Germany's reenergized everyday value menu along with additional strategic value activities in Germany and the U.K. aimed at driving customer traffic. While I am encouraged by January's results, we must continue to make progress to strengthen our European business. We are focused on enhancing our performance across the region through relevant menu offerings, targeted marketing and improved operations, with emphasis on service.
   
 "Our performance in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa benefited from ongoing initiatives to enhance our menu variety and value, generating comparable sales of 7.1% against strong prior year results."
   
 Skinner added,
   
"Our goal for the year is to continue executing the Plan to Win with renewed energy and unwavering focus and discipline. As we continue to raise the bar on operational excellence and leadership marketing, I am confident that we will exceed our customers' expectations."
