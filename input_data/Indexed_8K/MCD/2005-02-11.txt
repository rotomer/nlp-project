EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation today announced that it generated a record $3.9 billion in cash from operations in 2004, up more than $600 million over 2003. Higher sales and profits at existing restaurants drove this record cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2004 were $1.4 billion, resulting in record free cash flow of $2.5 billion.
Jim Skinner, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer said, "Over the past two years, McDonald's revitalization efforts have been aligned with the Plan to Win and our commitment to growing by being better not just bigger. We have focused our resources on building comparable sales at existing restaurants by delivering a superior restaurant experience for our customers. This disciplined approach generated a $1 billion increase in cash from operations since 2002, and free cash flow nearly tripled during the same period. I am energized by our progress and pleased with our strong operational and financial foundation. As we move forward, we will maintain fiscal discipline, focusing our investments where they will have the most impact on our restaurants and our customers. With ongoing dedication to operational excellen ce and leadership marketing, I am confident that 2005 will be another good year for McDonald's."
During 2004, the Company paid down $816 million of debt, increased the annual dividend by 38 percent to $695 million and repurchased $621 million of its common stock.
