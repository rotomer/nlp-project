EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Investor Release
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005.
 
The Company reported the following highlights for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "We delivered solid operating results for the second quarter driven by positive global comparable sales and the continued strength of our U.S. business. U.S. revenues increased 7% for the quarter, driven by multiple complimentary initiatives that delivered compelling value, menu variety and added convenience to our customers.
 
"In Europe, although we continue to manage challenges in a few of our key markets, our ongoing emphasis on striking the right balance between branded everyday affordability, premium product selections and core menu offerings generated increased customer visits for the quarter. To strengthen the segment's performance, our European leadership team is committed to initiatives that will deliver an outstanding customer experience and generate further improvements in this critical area of the world.
 
"In our Asia/Pacific/Middle East/Africa segment, Australia's strong quarterly results were partly offset by weak performance in China and Japan. To broaden our success across the segment, we continue to develop our value and new product initiatives in several markets, including Japan and China. We expect these initiatives to enhance our consumer appeal and drive improved results for the region.
 
"The key to our success is firmly grounded in delivering continuous improvements across each of our Plan to Win's 5 P's - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. To further build upon the strong foundation we've established, we are focused on developing friendly and motivated staff, relevant menu offerings, modern and inviting locations, meaningful everyday value and marketing that resonates with customers around the world. In addition, we remain committed to exercising financial discipline in the deployment of our growing cash flow.
 
"Delivering an exceptional customer experience remains our top priority. Ongoing consistency in operational execution and leadership marketing will enable us to keep our brand relevant and on the right path to deliver solid, sustainable growth for this year and beyond."

Accounting Change
 
Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), , although not required to do so until 2006. This new accounting standard requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company, like most other U.S. companies, accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, , and related Interpretations. Accordingly, share-based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes. The Company's second quarter and six months 2004 pro forma earnings, as reported in Form 10-Q, included $0.03 and $0.06 per share of share-based compensation expense, respectively.
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
In 2005, in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing cash-based incentives and other equity based awards. Second quarter 2005 results included pretax expense of $45.1 million (or $0.02 per share) of which $35.8 million related to share-based compensation, stock options and restricted stock units ("RSU's"), and $9.3 million related to the shift of a portion of share-based compensation to primarily cash-based incentive compensation. For the six months 2005, results included pretax expense of $102.5 million (or $0.05 per share) of which $83.9 million related to share-based compensation and $18.6 million related to the compensation shift.
 
Net Income and Diluted Net Income per Common Share
 
For the quarter, net income and diluted net income per common share were $530.4 million and $0.42, respectively. The 2005 results included $112.0 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate approximately $3.2 billion in foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act, and pretax expense of $45.1 million or $0.02 per share related to share-based compensation. Second quarter 2004 diluted net income per common share was $0.47, excluding a pro forma expense of $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation as discussed in the section above.
 
Table of Contents
For the six months, net income and diluted net income per common share were $1,258.3 million and $0.98, respectively. The 2005 results included the $112.0 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense, a $178.8 million or $0.13 per share benefit primarily due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company's 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns in the first quarter and pretax expense of $102.5 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation.
 
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter were relatively flat due to higher weighted average shares outstanding, offset by a less dilutive effect of outstanding stock options.
 
For the six months, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased due to higher weighted average shares outstanding and a more dilutive effect of outstanding stock options.
 
During the quarter and six months, the Company repurchased $0.6 billion or 20.1 million shares and $1.0 billion or 33.6 million shares of its common stock, respectively.
 
Revenues
 
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald's restaurants in operation at least thirteen months.
 
COMPARABLE SALES  McDONALD'S RESTAURANTS*
 
 
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and six months. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.

Legal Proceedings
 
On May 31, 2005, a public civil action was filed in Brazil by the Federal Attorney's Office for the Federal District against, among others, McDonald's Comrcio de Alimentos Ltda, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("McCal"), and three of its former employees. The complaint alleges that McCal and its former employees made an improper payment to obtain tax guidance relating to the deductibility of franchisee royalty payments in Brazil. The complaint seeks certain monetary and non-monetary relief. The Company does not believe that this action will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results. The Company's investigation of the allegations is ongoing, however, and it cannot predict the outcome of this matter. The Company has also reported the allegations to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
