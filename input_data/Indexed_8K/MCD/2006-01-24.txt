Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "In 2005, McDonald's marked its third year of meaningful progress under the Plan to Win. Our customers rewarded us by visiting our contemporary, reimaged restaurants more often to enjoy our broad range of quality menu choices along with our convenience and branded affordability.
 
"Our System's relentless focus on the customer and alignment behind the Plan to Win delivered strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our performance reflects the ongoing strength of our U.S. business where we continue to leverage our convenience and build upon the successful initiatives launched over the past few years, including appealing menu additions, extended operating hours and cashless payment options. We are well positioned in the U.S. to continue our momentum in 2006.
 
"In Europe, we increased customer traffic and posted solid comparable sales of 2.6% for the year. Strong results in France and Russia as well as improvements in Germany contributed to operating performance. We will continue to build on our momentum in this important area of the world by strengthening our connection with customers through improved communication of our product quality, brand relevance and commitment to balanced, active lifestyles.
 
"We remain committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and enhancing shareholder value. In 2005, we increased our annual dividend by 22% per share, nearly tripling the payout since 2002. We also announced plans to return to shareholders $5 billion to $6 billion through dividends and share repurchases during 2006 and 2007, combined. Given our strong balance sheet and cash position, we plan to repurchase about $1 billion of McDonald's stock in first quarter 2006.
 
"We plan to invest $1.8 billion of capital this year primarily related to opening 800 new McDonald's restaurants and our reimaging efforts around the globe to keep the brand relevant. Our capital expenditure plans reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in markets with solid returns as well as future growth potential.
 
"As we begin 2006, our average annual long-term growth targets remain: Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%, annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. We are intensely focused on our customers and our restaurants. Our System is aligned to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders."

Accounting Change
 
Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), . This new accounting standard requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company, like most other U.S. companies, accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, , and related Interpretations. Accordingly, share-based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes. Pro forma share-based compensation was $241.2 million of pretax expense (or $0.11 per share) for 2004, as disclosed in our 2004 Form 10-K, and $179.4 million of pretax expense (or $0.08 per share) for the first nine months of 2004, as disclosed in the applicable Form 10-Q. Accordingly, pro forma share-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter 2004 was $61.8 million of pretax expense (or $0.03 per share).
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
In 2005, in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing cash-based incentives and other equity based awards. Fourth quarter 2005 results included pretax expense of $44.4 million (or $0.02 per share) of which $35.1 million related to share-based compensation, stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and $9.3 million related to the shift of a portion of share-based compensation to primarily cash-based incentive compensation. For the full year 2005, results included pretax expense of $191.2 million (or $0.10 per share) of which $154.1 million related to share-based compensation and $37.1 million related to the compensation shift.
 
Net Income and Diluted Net Income per Common Share
 
For the fourth quarter 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $608.5 million and $0.48, respectively. The 2005 results included $21.3 million after tax or $0.015 per share related to impairment charges, primarily in South Korea. Fourth quarter 2004 net income and diluted net income per common share was $397.9 million and $0.31, respectively, excluding a pro forma expense of $38.3 million after tax or $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation. The 2004 results included net expense of $180.1 million after tax or $0.14 per share comprised of $0.08 per share of expense related to the lease accounting correction, $0.08 of impairment charges primarily related to South Korea, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit related to the sale of the Company's interest in a U.S. real estate partnership.
 
For the full year 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2,602.2 million and $2.04, respectively. The 2005 results included a net tax benefit of $72.5 million or $0.05 comprised of $0.14 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company's 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns and $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act. In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges and credits that netted to $12.4 million income after tax or $0.01 of income per share. Net income and diluted net income per common share for the full year 2004 was $2.278.5 million and $1.79, respectively, excluding a pro forma expense of $149.5 million after tax or $0.11 per share related to share-based compensation. The 2004 results included net expense of $171.7 million after tax or $0.13 per share comprised of $0.08 per share of expense related to the lease accounting correction, $0.09 of impairment charges primarily related to South Korea, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit related to the sale of the Company's interest in a U.S. real estate partnership, which enabled the Company to release a valuation allowance related to certain capital loss carryforwards and resulted in an additional $0.02 per share tax benefit.
 
During the full year 2005, the Company repurchased $1.2 billion or 39.5 million shares of its common stock.
 
Shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased for the fourth quarter as the treasury stock purchased in 2005 more than offset higher shares outstanding at the beginning of the year and current year options exercised. For full year 2005, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald's restaurants in operation at least thirteen months.

The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and year. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.
