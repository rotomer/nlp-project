Annual Meetings of Stockholders
 
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 9, such business, as determined by the Chairman of the meeting, must be a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware corporation law, and the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by more than sixty (60) days from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and a representation as to whether or not the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such proposed nominee; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and a representation as to whether or not the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such proposal; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.
 
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for Directors or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
 
(B) - Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting of stockholders pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. Nominations by stockholders of such persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.
Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
(C) - (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. The Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 9 or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposed nomination or proposed business without such stockholder having made the representation required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9, to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.
General
 
(2) For purposes of this Section 9, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.

Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires and until their successors shall be elected and shall qualify. No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director.

If the Chairman of the Board is an officer of, or employed in an executive or any other capacity by, the Corporation, the Board of Directors also shall elect a Presiding Director. The Presiding Director shall not be an officer of, or employed in an executive or any other capacity by, the Corporation.

Procedural Provisions
 
The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated in these By-Laws or as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
 
Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report its acts and proceedings to the Board.

For purposes of this Section, members of the Board of Directors who serve the Corporation in capacities such as outside consultants, attorneys, or business advisors, shall not be considered by virtue of such service as being employed by the Corporation.

One of the officers of the Corporation shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders and Directors in a book to be kept for that purpose. Officers shall be chosen in such manner and shall hold their offices for such terms as are prescribed in these By-Laws or determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 1 - Right to Indemnification
 
(A) - Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is an Indemnified Person, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the DGCL permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment). Such indemnification shall cover all expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) and all liabilities and losses (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or other excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred by such person in connection therewith.
Indemnified Persons
 
(B) - (1) Each Additional Indemnified Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is an Additional Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) and all liabilities and losses (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or other excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred by such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified Person acted in Good Faith. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that an Additional Indemnified Person did not act in Good Faith.
Additional Indemnified Persons
 
(2) Each Additional Indemnified Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is an Additional Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) incurred by such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified Person acted in Good Faith, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such person's duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Additional Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
(3) Any indemnification under paragraphs (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this Section 1 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless it is determined that indemnification of the Additional Indemnified Person is not proper in the circumstances because such person has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in either paragraph (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this Section 1. Such determination shall be made: (a) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable if a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion. Such determination shall be made within one hundred twenty (120) days (or such longer period established as set forth in the next sentence) after receipt by the Board of Directors of written notice from the Additional Indemnified Person seeking indemnification setting forth in reasonable detail the facts known to such person concerning the Proceeding. The period during which the Board of Directors may determine that indemnification is not proper may be extended to a period established by the Board of Directors by written notice to the Additional Indemnified Person delivered to such person within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the Board of Directors of such person's written notice seeking indemnification.
 
(C) - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, except with respect to indemnification of Indemnified Persons specified in Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnified Person or Additional Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if (i) authorization for such Proceeding (or part thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to the earlier of (x) sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice thereof from such Indemnified Person or one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of written notice thereof from such Additional Indemnified Person, as the case may be, or (y) a Change of Control, and (ii) in the case of a Proceeding initiated by an Additional Indemnified Person, it is not a Proceeding to enforce rights under this Article V.
Denial of Authorization for Certain Proceedings 
 
(D) - For purposes of this Article V, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined):
Certain Defined Terms
 
 
 
 
 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) is or becomes (except in a transaction approved in advance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under such Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities, or (B) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Corporation cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof unless the election of each Director who was not a Director at the beginning of the period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Directors then still in office who were Directors at the beginning of the period;
 
 
 
- - Expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, reasonably and actually incurred by a person indemnified pursuant to Section 1 of this Article V in defending or otherwise being involved in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking in the form required by the Corporation (the "Undertaking") by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation and subject to such other terms and conditions as the Corporation deems appropriate; provided, that (A) if a Change of Control has occurred, such person shall be required to deliver to the Corporation the Undertaking only if such an undertaking is required under the DGCL then in effect, and (B) in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person, except a Proceeding authorized by Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall pay said expenses in advance of final disposition only if authorization for such Proceeding (or part thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days in the case of an Indemnified Person, or one hundred twenty (120) days in the case of an Additional Indemnified Person, after receipt of a written request for such advancement accompanied by the Undertaking or (ii) a Change of Control. A person to whom expenses are advanced pursuant hereto shall not be obligated to repay pursuant to the Undertaking until the final determination of any pending Proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the right of such person to be indemnified or the obligation of such person to repay such expenses.
Section 2 - Expenses
 
- If a proper claim by an Indemnified Person under Section 1 of this Article V is not paid in full by the Corporation within one hundred twenty (120) days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the Corporation or if expenses pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V have not been advanced by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written request for such advancement by an Indemnified Person (accompanied by the Undertaking if required by Section 2 of this Article V) has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or the advancement of expenses. If successful, in whole or in part, in such suit, such claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the reasonable expense thereof including attorneys' fees and disbursements. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the Undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) (or, if a Change of Control has occurred, the Undertaking is not required to be tendered to the Corporation under the DGCL) that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited by law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. If a Change of Control has occurred, a claimant making a claim under Section 1 of this Article V or seeking to avoid repayment to the Corporation of expenses advanced pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V shall have (i) the right, but not the obligation, to have a determination made by independent legal counsel, at the expense of the Corporation, as to whether indemnification of the claimant is prohibited by law; and (ii) shall have the right (A) to select as independent legal counsel to make such determination any legal counsel designated for such purpose in a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors that is in full force and effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or (B), if the Board of Directors has failed to designate any such legal counsel or all such counsel refuse to make such a determination, to request the American Arbitration Association, at the expense of the Corporation, to select an independent legal counsel familiar with matters of the type in dispute to make such a determination. If a determination has been made in accordance with the preceding sentence, no determination inconsistent therewith by other legal counsel, by the Board of Directors, or by stockholders shall be of any force or effect. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination, if required, prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited.
Section 3 - Protection of Rights
 
-
Section 4 - Miscellaneous
 
(A) - The rights conferred on any person by this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
 
(B) - The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, Delegate, employee, or agent of, the Corporation against any expenses, liabilities or losses, regardless of whether the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expenses, liabilities or losses under the DGCL. The Corporation hereby agrees that, for a period of six (6) years after any Change of Control, it shall cause to be maintained policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage at least comparable to and in the same amounts as that provided by any such policies in effect immediately prior to such Change of Control.

Insurance, contracts, and funding
 
(C) - The provisions of this Article V as amended effective January 26, 2006 shall be applicable with respect to events, acts and omissions occurring prior to or subsequent to such Amendment, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, Delegate or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. This Article V shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each person who, at any time that this Article V as so amended is in effect, serves or agrees to serve in any capacity which entitles him to indemnification hereunder and any repeal or other modification of this Article V or any repeal or modification of the DGCL or any other applicable law shall not limit any rights of indemnification for Proceedings then existing or arising out of events, acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification, including, without limitation, the right to indemnification for Proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article V with regard to Proceedings arising out of acts, omissions or events arising prior to such repeal or modification.
Contractual nature

Subrogation
 
(F) - If this Article V, or any portion hereof shall be invalidated or held to be unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of which shall not have been reversed on appeal, this Article V shall be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law and, as so modified, this Article V and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 4 - Record Date

- No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its Directors or officers or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its Directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason or solely because the Director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose if:

Directors or the committee and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
