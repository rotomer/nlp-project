OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that global comparable sales rose 5.3% in March, on top of outstanding performance in March 2005.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "Our customer-focused Plan to Win continues to generate strong sales results thus far in 2006, with positive comparable sales across all geographic segments for the month of March and the first quarter. These strong results were fueled by increased customer visits as we enhanced McDonalds relevance with new menu items featured in a more contemporary and inviting restaurant atmosphere.
"For the month of March, comparable sales in the U.S. were up 6.6% driven by breakfast and the convenience of our extended operating hours. The launch of our new Premium Roast Coffee encouraged more customers to enjoy the new coffee blend along with our popular breakfast menu.
"Europe's comparable sales grew 1.6% in March led by strong performance in France and Russia. We are pleased with these results given harsh weather in certain markets and the shift in the Easter and school-related holidays from March in 2005 to April in 2006. We remain focused on driving momentum across Europe by enhancing the customer experience and providing relevant menu options.
"In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comparable sales for March were up 5.0%, led by strong results in Australia and improved results in China.

First quarter 2006 earnings are expected to be about $0.49 per share, including a $0.01 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Also included is $0.045 per share of expense primarily related to previously announced actions taken for a limited number of restaurant closings in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review, costs to buyout certain franchisees in Brazil and a loss on the anticipated sale of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee. In addition, 2006 results included a gain of $0.035 per share due to the IPO of Chipotle Mexican Grill and the concurrent sale of Chipotle shares.
First quarter 2005 reported earnings were $0.56 per share, which included a $0.13 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement.
