Item 8.01. Other Events.
As previously announced, McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) is planning to dispose of its remaining interest in Chipotle Mexican Grill through a tax-free exchange of Chipotle shares for McDonalds stock. In light of its contemplated repurchase of McDonalds stock through the exchange offer, McDonalds is today announcing that it was notified that three investment funds managed by Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. or its affiliates planned to file on or about August 15, 2006 necessary notifications under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act to acquire in excess of $793.8 million of McDonald's common stock. The prescribed "waiting periods" under the Act must expire or be terminated before these funds may increase their ownership level as specified in the notices received by McDonald's.
