SIGNATURES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation today announced the final exchange ratio in connection with its previously announced offer to its shareholders to exchange all or some of their shares of McDonald's common stock for shares of class B common stock of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. held by McDonald's.
,
For each share of McDonald's common stock that is validly tendered and delivered pursuant to the offer and accepted by McDonald's, McDonald's will deliver 0.8879
shares of Chipotle class B common stock to or at the direction of such tendering holder. The final calculated per-share value of the McDonald's common stock and the final calculated per-share value of the Chipotle class B common stock, in each case determined in the manner described in the exchange offer prospectus, which were used to calculate the final exchange ratio, were $39.91845
and $49.95375
respectively. Because the exchange offer is subject to proration, the number of shares that McDonald's accepts in the exchange offer may be less than the number of shares tendered by shareholders.
The exchange offer will expire today, October 5, at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, unless extended or terminated.
The terms and conditions of the exchange offer are more fully described in an exchange offer prospectus previously filed by Chipotle and a Schedule TO previously filed by McDonald's with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders who tender their shares by means of a notice of guaranteed delivery before expiration of the offer must deliver the related shares to the exchange agent by Wednesday, October 11, 2006. Columbus Day, Monday, October 9, 2006 is not included in determining the standard three-day settlement cycle for guaranteed deliveries even though it is a New York Stock Exchange trading day.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is serving as the dealer manager for the transaction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
McDonald's is the leading global foodservice retailer with more than 30,000 local restaurants in more than 100 countries. Approximately 70% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent, local men and women.
Chipotle operates more than 500 fast-casual, fresh Mexican food restaurants in 23 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia.
Additional Information
In connection with the proposed disposition by McDonald's of its interest in Chipotle via an exchange offer, Chipotle has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement that includes an exchange offer prospectus. The prospectus contains important information about the disposition and related matters, and McDonald's has mailed the prospectus to its shareholders. Investors and security holders are urged to read the prospectus, and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, before making any investment decision. None of McDonald's, Chipotle or any of their respective directors or officers or any dealer manager appointed with respect to the exchange offer makes any recommendation as to whether you should participate in the exchange offer.
