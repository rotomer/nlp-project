McDONALD'S REPORTS STRONG INCREASE IN SALES
 
AND PRELIMINARY EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation announced today that Systemwide sales for McDonald's restaurants worldwide increased 9.8% in September, or 8.7% in constant currencies. For the quarter, Systemwide sales rose 8.4%, or 6.9% in constant currencies.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner said, "Our Plan to Win is powering sustainable momentum in our business with every area of the world once again posting strong comparable sales growth. We are increasing relevance, enhancing menu variety and improving customer convenience."
In the U.S., McDonald's market-leading breakfast business and the popular new Snack Wrap helped accelerate momentum, delivering robust comparable sales growth of 7.1% for the month and 4.1% for the quarter.
McDonald's business in Europe posted another month and quarter of strong comparable sales, up 9.0% and 7.6%, respectively. These results were driven by ongoing positive performance in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and most other markets. The Company's strategic focus on appealing to customers with a range of locally relevant premium, core and everyday low-price offerings continues to benefit Europe's results.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comparable sales rose 6.6% in September and 6.1% for the quarter, primarily driven by Japan's performance.

Preliminary third quarter 2006 earnings per share are expected to be $0.68, including $0.01 of expense relating to impairment and other charges primarily in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Foreign currency translation is expected to have a positive impact of $0.01 per share.
Third quarter 2005 earnings per share of $0.58 included $0.02 of income primarily resulting from the transfer of the Company's ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee.

Exhibit 99(b)
 
 
Investor Release
 
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation today announced the final results of the Chipotle exchange offer. The offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on October 5, 2006. Under the terms of the offer, McDonald's accepted 18,628,187 shares of McDonald's common stock in exchange for the 16,539,967 shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonald's. Each share of McDonald's common stock accepted for exchange by McDonald's was exchanged for 0.8879 shares of Chipotle class B common stock.
Because the offer was oversubscribed, McDonald's accepted tendered shares on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of shares tendered. Shareholders who owned less than 100 shares of McDonald's common stock, or an "odd-lot", who validly tendered all of their shares, could elect not to be subject to proration, in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer. All shares tendered by eligible electing odd-lot shareholders have been accepted. The final proration factor of 7.01043% was applied to all other tendered shares of McDonald's common stock to determine the number of such shares that would be accepted.
Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the results of the exchange offer are as follows:
The exchange agent is expected to deliver shares of Chipotle class B common stock as follows: (1) with respect to shares tendered through DTC, to the account of DTC on Thursday, October 12, 2006, so that DTC can credit the relevant DTC participant (and such participant can credit its respective account holders promptly thereafter), and (2) with respect to shares tendered outside DTC, to direct registered accounts of the respective holders by Monday, October 16, 2006. The exchange agent is expected to mail or deliver checks in lieu of a fractional share of Chipotle Class B common stock as well as shares of McDonald's common stock tendered but not accepted for exchange by Friday, October 20, 2006.
The terms and conditions of the exchange offer are more fully described in an exchange offer prospectus previously filed by Chipotle and a Schedule TO previously filed by McDonald's with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated served as the dealer manager for the transaction.
