Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "We generated impressive third quarter results as we continue to raise the bar on operations excellence and leadership marketing to broaden consumer relevance. For the quarter, global comparable sales were at their highest quarterly level in two years, and we delivered higher margins across all segments of the business. These results validate the strength of our customer-centric Plan to Win and the power of growing by being better, not just bigger."
In the U.S., we continue to enhance the McDonald's experience by providing innovative menu options, added conveniences and contemporary restaurant locations that are in sync with customers' lifestyles. The stability of McDonald's U.S. performance is a testament to the strength and flexibility of the McDonald's System.
Skinner also noted, "McDonald's Europe generated another quarter of strong operating results driven by robust quarterly sales, more customer visits and the highest Company-operated margins since 2001. We are encouraged by Europe's progress and confident that our strategies to further strengthen the McDonald's Brand through marketing, value and menu initiatives that resonate with consumers will continue to drive growth over the long-term.
"The entire McDonald's System is energized by our current momentum and we remain intent on further enhancing every element of the Brand experience to capture the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to McDonald's Corporation's results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Reported Results
Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because it believes they better represent the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share for the quarter, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, the British Pound and the Canadian Dollar.
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues for the nine months primarily due to the stronger Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro and British Pound. Foreign currency translation had a slightly negative impact on operating income, net income and earnings per share for the nine months due to the weakening of several major currencies, partly offset by the stronger Canadian Dollar.
 
Table of Contents
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the quarter, net income was $843.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.68. The 2006 results included $13.1 million after tax ($0.01 per share) of impairment and other charges primarily in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), which included an additional loss on the transfer of the Company's ownership interest in Thailand to a developmental licensee and a goodwill impairment charge in South Korea.
Third quarter 2005 net income was $735.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.58. The 2005 results included income of $20.8 million after tax ($0.02 per share) primarily related to the transfer of the Company's ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee.
For the nine months 2006, net income was $2,302.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.83. Results included the following items: operating expense of $89.5 million after tax ($0.08 per share) primarily related to a limited number of restaurant closings in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review, costs to buy out certain litigating franchisees in Brazil, and losses related to the transfer of the Company's ownership interests in Thailand and Bulgaria to developmental licensees; nonoperating income of $173.4 million after tax ($0.14 per share) due to the IPO of Chipotle Mexican Grill and the secondary sales of Chipotle shares; and $13.5 million ($0.01 per share) of incremental tax expense primarily related to the one-time impact from a tax law change in Canada.
For the nine months 2005, net income was $1,993.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.56. The results for 2005 included $0.03 per share of income primarily related to the transfer of the Company's ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs. In addition, 2005 results included a tax benefit of $178.8 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company's 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by $112.0 million of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate approximately $3 billion in foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA), which in combination, benefited earnings per share by an additional $0.05 per share.
During the nine months 2006, the Company repurchased 53.2 million shares for $1.8 billion.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter and nine months 2006 decreased primarily due to treasury stock purchases exceeding stock option exercises in 2005 and 2006.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald's restaurants, including those operated by the Company, franchisees and affiliates, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES  McDONALD'S RESTAURANTS*
 
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and nine months. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.

Outlook
While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company's results.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As part of the ongoing review of our ownership mix, we have increased the number of markets being considered for potential conversion. As appropriate, we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee. In the aggregate, the markets we are now considering include approximately 2,300 restaurants and represent about $3.0 billion in combined net investment. If we are able to complete these transactions, we do not anticipate recovering most of the net book value in the form of sales proceeds. The timing and amount of any losses will depend on the circumstances of each transaction and could be significant.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. By far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise, developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our plan to reduce our ownership of restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons, and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate, as well as our results. In particular, increasing consumer focus on food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand and may adversely affect our sales and costs of doing business.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
We developed the Plan to Win to address the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
Our plans call for a reduction in Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. by re-franchising them to third parties and the pursuit of a developmental license model in certain markets. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has significantly increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following:

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock. These factors include some over which we have no control, such as general market conditions and governmental actions or reports about economic activity that may have a market-moving impact, regardless of whether the action or activity directly relates to our business. Actions or reports by U.S. authorities are of special import since the United States is our largest segment and our principal trading market. Trading activity in our common stock (whether in the cash or derivative markets) also affects prices and volatility. In addition to reflecting investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity can include significant purchases by shareholders who may seek to affect our business strategies, as well as both sales and purchases resulting from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald's may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, our stock price can be affected not only by operating actions we take, but also by non-operating initiatives, such as our plans to reduce shares outstanding through repurchases or increases in our dividend rate.
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes), terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events (such as the potential spread of avian flu) can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels and in turn the McDonald's System and our results and prospects in the affected markets. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
