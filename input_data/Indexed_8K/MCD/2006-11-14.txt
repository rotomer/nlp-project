Item 5.03.  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
 
   
On and effective November 9, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of McDonald's Corporation (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee of the Board, amended the By-Laws of the Company (the "By-Laws").  Among the changes to the By-Laws, the Board:
Deleted a provision from Section 4 of Article II that established a plurality voting standard for all director elections.
Added a new Section 5 to Article II to establish a majority voting standard to elect directors in uncontested elections.  Under the new majority voting standard, nominees for director must receive more votes for than against their election to be elected to the Board, unless one or more stockholder nominees are competing for Board seats as of ten days before the Company mails its notice of meeting to stockholders, in which case directors will be elected by plurality vote.
Added a new Section 6 to Article II, which requires nominees for director to provide certain information to the Company to be eligible for election or re-election.
Revised the requirements a stockholder must satisfy to propose business or to nominate a person for election or re-election to the Board at an annual or special meeting of stockholders.
Re-numbered Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II so that the provisions that appeared in each of these sections prior to the By-Law amendments now appear in Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of Article II, respectively.
Amended Section 2 of Article III to clarify that a director's resignation may be conditioned on Board acceptance.
              
The foregoing is a summary of the By-Law amendments.  This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the By-Laws, as amended and restated and filed as Exhibit 3.2 attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 On November 8, 2006, McDonalds Corporation (the Company) issued an Investor Release reporting the Companys October and year-to-date 2006 sales. The Investor Release is furnished as Exhibit 99 and is attached hereto.

Such indemnification shall cover all expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) and all liabilities and losses (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or other excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred by such person in connection therewith.

Additional Indemnified Persons
- (1) Each Additional Indemnified Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is an Additional Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) and all liabilities and losses (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or other excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred by such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified Person acted in Good Faith. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or

upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that an Additional Indemnified Person did not act in Good Faith.
(2) Each Additional Indemnified Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is an Additional Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation against expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) incurred by such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified Person acted in Good Faith, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such person's duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Additional Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(3) Any indemnification under paragraphs (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this Section 1 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless it is determined that indemnification of the Additional Indemnified Person is not proper in the circumstances because such person has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in either paragraph (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this Section 1. Such determination shall be made: (a) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable if a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion. Such determination shall be made within one hundred twenty (120) days (or such longer period established as set forth in the next sentence) after receipt by the Board of Directors of written notice from the Additional Indemnified Person seeking indemnification setting forth in reasonable detail the facts known to such person concerning the Proceeding. The period during which the Board of Directors may deter-mine that indemnification is not proper may be extended to a period established by the Board of Directors by written notice to the Additional Indemnified Person delivered to such person within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the Board of Directors of such person's written notice seeking indemnification.
 
(C)
Denial of Authorization for Certain Proceedings 
- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, except with respect to indemnification of Indemnified Persons specified in Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnified Person or Additional Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if (i) authorization for such Proceeding (or part thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to the earlier of (x) sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice thereof from such Indemnified Person or one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of written notice thereof from such Additional Indemnified Person, as the case may be, or (y) a Change of Control, and (ii) in the case of a Proceeding initiated by an Additional Indemnified Person, it is not a Proceeding to enforce rights under this Article V.
(D)
Certain Defined Terms
- For purposes of this Article V, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined):
 
 
 
10
 
Section 2 - Expenses
- Expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, reasonably and actually incurred by a person indemnified pursuant to Section 1 of this Article V in defending or
 
 
 
11
 
otherwise being involved in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking in the form required by the Corporation (the "Undertaking") by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation and subject to such other terms and conditions as the Corporation deems appropriate; provided, that (A) if a Change of Control has occurred, such person shall be required to deliver to the Corporation the Undertaking only if such an undertaking is required under the DGCL then in effect, and (B) in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person, except a Proceeding authorized by Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall pay said expenses in advance of final disposition only if authorization for such Proceeding (or part thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days in the case of an Indemnified Person, or one hundred twenty (120) days in the case of an Additional Indemnified Person, after receipt of a written request for such advancement accompanied by the Undertaking or (ii) a Change of Control. A person to whom expenses are advanced pursuant hereto shall not be obligated to repay pursuant to the Undertaking until the final determination of any pending Proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the right of such person to be indemnified or the obligation of such person to repay such expenses.
 
Section 3 - Protection of Rights
- If a proper claim by an Indemnified Person under Section 1 of this Article V is not paid in full by the Corporation within one hundred twenty (120) days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the Corporation or if expenses pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V have not been advanced by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written request for such advancement by an Indemnified Person (accompanied by the Undertaking if required by Section 2 of this Article V) has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or the advancement of expenses. If successful, in whole or in part, in such suit, such claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the reasonable expense thereof including attorneys fees and disbursements. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the Undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) (or, if a Change of Control has occurred, the Undertaking is not required to be tendered to the Corporation under the DGCL) that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited by law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. If a Change of Control has occurred, a claimant making a claim under Section 1 of this Article V or seeking to avoid repayment to the Corporation of expenses advanced pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V shall have (i) the right, but not the obligation, to have a determination made by independent legal counsel, at the expense of the Corpora-tion, as to whether indemnification of the claimant is prohibited by law; and (ii) shall have the right (A) to select as independent legal counsel to make such determination any legal counsel designated for such purpose in a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors that is in full force and effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or (B), if the Board of Directors has failed to designate any such legal counsel or all such counsel refuse to make such a determination, to request the American Arbitration Association, at the expense of the Corporation, to select an independent legal counsel familiar with matters of the type in dispute to make such a determination. If a determination has been made in accordance with the preceding sentence, no determination inconsistent therewith by other legal counsel, by the Board of Directors, or by stockholders shall be of any force or effect. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination, if required, prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
 
 
 
12
 
 
that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that indemnification of the claimant is prohibited.
Section 4 - Miscellaneous
-

- The rights conferred on any person by this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.

The Corporation hereby agrees that, for a period of six (6) years after any Change of Control, it shall cause to be maintained policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage at least comparable to and in the same amounts as that provided by any such policies in effect immediately prior to such Change of Control.
