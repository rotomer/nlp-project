Exhibit 99

OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that Systemwide sales for McDonalds restaurants worldwide increased 10.5% in November, or 7.2% in constant currencies.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner said,
"
McDonalds ongoing emphasis on delivering a superior customer experience continues to drive strong top-line results around the globe, with worldwide comparable sales rising 6.2% in November.
"
In the U.S., comparable sales increased 5.1% as McDonalds remains a favored breakfast and late-night destination. Our unique menu variety, including the popular Snack Wrap, compelling everyday value and added conveniences continue to be the key elements behind our comparable sales performance.
In Europe, strong results in France and Germany fueled an 8.4% increase in comparable sales for the month. Europes results benefited from combined initiatives that paired
premium burgers with engaging promotions featuring the popular family games of UNO and Monopoly.
McDonalds remains focused on evolving the customer experience to achieve even greater relevance with European consumers.
