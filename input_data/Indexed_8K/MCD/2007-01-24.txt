Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation reported diluted earnings per share of $1.00 for the quarter and $2.83 for the year, reflecting strong operating results around the world.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "McDonald's is delivering the strongest business results in 30 years. Our double-digit earnings growth for both the fourth quarter and full year reflects the success of our Plan to Win. We are serving more customers around the clock and around the world in more relevant ways than ever before. McDonald's is enhancing the customer experience through menu choice, variety and value, all served in a contemporary restaurant environment. We begin 2007 from a position of strength and I am confident we will continue to deliver sustained profitable growth well into the future."
McDonald's reported the following fourth quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
Full year 2006 highlights include:
 
 
 
Skinner continued, "McDonald's U.S. business marked its fourth consecutive year of comparable sales increases and higher profitability. Our strategic focus on serving customers an effective balance of new menu items, premium products and everyday value in convenient, contemporary locations continued to drive results.
 
"Europe also generated strong results for the year as the countries focused on delivering locally relevant products and promotions and communicating the strengths of the McDonald's brand. Europe's momentum continued during the fourth quarter with increasing customer traffic and robust comparable sales fueling the segment's performance. I am pleased with the progress we made in Europe throughout 2006, and I am confident we will build on these results in 2007.
"During 2006, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value with several notable events. We increased our annual dividend by nearly 50% to $1.00 per share, returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and shares acquired, and completed the disposition of our ownership interest in Chipotle Mexican Grill. In addition, we fulfilled our commitment to reduce shares outstanding by about 5% by the end of 2006.
"We will continue to maintain financial discipline, investing capital where we expect to generate strong returns over the long term. In 2007, we plan to invest about $1.9 billion of capital to open about 800 new McDonald's restaurants and to reinvest in our existing locations. We also remain intent on optimizing our restaurant ownership mix by continuing to pursue our developmental license strategy and by reducing the percentage of Company-operated restaurants in certain of our major markets.
"Our convenient locations and commitment to operations excellence position us to maximize the opportunities in the global marketplace. As we begin the new year, we will continue to leverage our strengths by delivering a relevant restaurant experience that resonates with customers and enhances brand loyalty."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to McDonald's Corporation's results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Reported Results
Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because it believes they better represent the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share for the quarter, primarily driven by the stronger Euro and British Pound.
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share for the full year primarily due to the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. Consolidated revenues were also positively impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real.

Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the fourth quarter 2006, net income was $1.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.00. For the fourth quarter 2005, net income and diluted earnings per share were $608.5 million and $0.48 per share. During 2006, the Company disposed of its entire investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and an October tax-free exchange for McDonald's common stock. As a result of this complete disposition, Chipotle's results of operations and exchange gain are reflected as income from discontinued operations of $480.3 million, or $0.39 per share, for the fourth quarter 2006. Income from continuing operations was $761.2 million or $0.61 per share, representing increases of 26% and 30%, respectively, compared with $604.8 million or $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2005.
For the full year 2006, net income and diluted earnings per share were $3.5 billion and $2.83. These results included $671.2 million of income, or $0.53 per share, related to discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.30 per share, which included impairment and other charges of $98.4 million after tax ($0.07 per share), as well as net incremental tax expense of $0.01 per share primarily related to a one-time impact from a tax law change in Canada.
For the full year 2005, net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.6 billion and $2.04. Income from discontinued operations was $15.8 million or $0.01 per share, while income from continuing operations was $2.6 billion or $2.03 per share. The 2005 results included a net tax benefit of $72.5 million or $0.05 per share, comprised of $0.14 per share of tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company's 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns and $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges (credits), net of $12.4 million of income after tax or $0.01 per share.
During the full year 2006, the Company acquired 98.4 million shares, or $3.7 billion through both share repurchases and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding compared with 2005. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 decreased primarily due to stock acquisitions exceeding stock option exercises in 2005 and 2006.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald's restaurants, including those operated by the Company, franchisees and affiliates, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES  McDONALD'S RESTAURANTS*
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and year. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

For the full year 2005, the Company recorded $28.4 million of income. In addition to the fourth quarter 2005 charges previously mentioned, the full year included $50.4 million of income primarily due to the transfer of the Company's ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs.

Outlook
While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The markets we are considering for potential conversion to developmental licenses include approximately 2,300 restaurants and represent about $3.0 billion in combined net investment. As appropriate, we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee. If we are able to complete these transactions, we do not anticipate recovering most of the net book value in the form of sales proceeds, and therefore, we expect that the loss, in the aggregate, would be significant. The timing and amount of any loss for a particular transaction will depend on individual circumstances.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. By far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise, developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our plan to reduce our ownership of restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons, and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate, as well as our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand and may adversely affect our results.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
We developed the Plan to Win to address the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
Our plans call for a reduction in Company-operated restaurants by re-franchising them or entering into developmental license agreements. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and will be affected by the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following:

Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has significantly increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following:

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock. These factors include some over which we have no control, such as general market conditions and governmental actions or reports about economic activity that may have a market-moving impact, regardless of whether the action or activity directly relates to our business. Actions or reports by U.S. authorities are of special import since the United States is our largest segment and our principal trading market. Trading activity in our common stock (whether in the cash or derivative markets) also affects prices and volatility. In addition to reflecting investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity can include significant purchases by shareholders who may seek to affect our business strategies, as well as both sales and purchases resulting from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald's may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, our stock price can be affected not only by operating actions we take, but also by non-operating initiatives, such as our plans to reduce shares outstanding through repurchases or increases in our dividend rate.
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes), terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events (such as the potential spread of avian flu) can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels and in turn the McDonald's System and our results and prospects in the affected markets. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
