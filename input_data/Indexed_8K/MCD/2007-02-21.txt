Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On February 14, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) approved grants of new awards under the Companys Cash Performance Unit Plan, or CPUP, for the performance period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 for Companys executive officers named in the Companys most recent proxy statement who are eligible to participate in the CPUP.
 
The target award for James A. Skinner is $3,600,000. The target award for Matthew H. Paull is $1,200,000. The target award for Ralph Alvarez is $2,000,000.
 
The 2007-2009 CPUP operates on a three-year cycle with a cumulative payout at the end of the cycle. The final payout is determined based on the entire performance period. Participants will not receive any payout under the new CPUP until after the end of the performance period on December 31, 2009.
 
The performance measures that will be used to calculate CPUP payouts for the 2007-2009 performance cycle are:
 
 
 
To calculate the final payout, the amount based on the above performance measures will be adjusted by a multiplier based on the Companys cumulative total shareholder return versus the S&P 500 Index for the performance period, which may result in final payouts being increased or decreased by up to 15%.
 
The maximum final payout that each of Messrs. Skinner, Paull and Alvarez can earn under the 2007-2009 CPUP is 230% of the target award.
On February 14, 2007, the Committee approved grants of restricted stock units, or RSUs, under the Companys Amended and Restated 2001 Omnibus Stock Ownership Plan to Messrs. Skinner, Paull and Alvarez and determined the performance-based vesting conditions that will apply to the RSUs.
 
The RSUs cliff vest after three years, subject to a performance-based vesting condition linked to the level of compounded annual growth in diluted earnings per share, or EPS, achieved by the Company during the three-year vesting period. The EPS target for full vesting of the RSUs is 7% compounded annual EPS growth. If less than 2% compounded growth is achieved, none of the RSUs will vest. If EPS growth is at or above the 2% threshold but below the 7% target, a portion of the awards will vest in proportion to the level of EPS growth achieved.

On February 14, 2007, the Committee approved final payouts in respect of 2006 under the Companys annual broad-based incentive plan, which is referred to as the Target Incentive Plan or TIP, to Messrs. Skinner, Paull and Alvarez as well as Michael J. Roberts.
 
TIP payouts were determined based primarily on growth in Brand McDonalds operating income in 2006. The maximum final TIP payout that the executive officers could earn was 250% of their respective target awards.
 
Based on the superior performance of the Company and the individual performance of each of the respective officers in 2006, the final TIP payouts for Messrs. Skinner, Paull, Alvarez and Roberts were significantly above their target awards. The final TIP payouts for these officers are shown in the table below.
 
 
 
 
On February 14, 2007, the Committee approved final payouts to Messrs. Skinner, Paull, Alvarez, as well as Michael J. Roberts and M. Lawrence Light under the CPUP for the performance period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. Messrs. Roberts and Light received pro rated payouts because they were not eligible for participation in CPUP throughout the entire performance period.
 
The final CPUP awards for these officers for the 2004-2006 performance period were as follows:
 
 
 
 
Final payouts were determined based on substantially the same performance metrics as those described above for the 2007-2009 performance cycle.
 
Based on the Companys superior performance during the 2004-2006 performance period, the final CPUP payouts for Messrs. Skinner, Paull and Alvarez were 215% of their target awards. Messrs. Roberts and Light received pro rated payouts, based on 215% of their respective target awards, reflecting the portion of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date on which each of them ceased to be eligible to participate in CPUP.
