OAK BROOK, IL - McDonalds Corporation announced today that global comparable sales rose 5.7% for the month and 5.3% for year-to-date February. Systemwide sales for McDonalds restaurants worldwide increased 9.7% in February, or 6.8% in constant currencies.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner said, "Our ongoing commitment to enhance the McDonalds restaurant experience and provide greater customer relevance continues to deliver results. Our February top-line performance reflects ongoing focus and alignment behind the Plan to Win."
In the U.S., Februarys comparable sales rose 3.1% as increasingly time-pressed consumers continue to favor McDonalds convenient breakfast and late-night menu selections. In addition, the national launch of the new grilled and honey-mustard Snack Wrap options expanded the variety offered at McDonalds and contributed to results.
In Europe, positive results in nearly every market drove comparable sales up 5.9% in February. Performance in France and Germany benefited from seasonal menus that offer customers unique premium, core and dessert menu choices.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, comparable sales rose 12.3% in February, led by strong performance in Japan and China, reflecting a benefit from the Chinese New Year during the month and positive consumer response to the markets branded affordability and convenience strategies.
Skinner added, "
As we move through 2007, we will continue to take action across all facets of our Plan to further connect with our customers.
"
