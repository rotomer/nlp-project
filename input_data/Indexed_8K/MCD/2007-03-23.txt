Effective April 1, 2007, Peter J. Bensen, Corporate Vice President - Assistant Corporate Controller of McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds), will succeed David M. Pojman as Corporate Senior Vice President - Corporate Controller of McDonalds. Mr. Bensen, 44, has served as Corporate Vice President - Assistant Controller of McDonalds since February 2002. He has been with McDonalds for 11 years.
Mr. Pojman has decided to retire in early 2008. Pending his retirement, he will continue to serve as Corporate Senior Vice President of McDonald's with responsibility for internal audit.
As a result of Mr. Bensens promotion, he will become eligible to participate in McDonalds Cash Performance Unit Plan, or CPUP, for the performance period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009, on a pro rated basis from April 1, 2007. The prorated target award for Mr. Bensen is $252,175. The CPUP operates on a three-year cycle with a cumulative payout at the end of the cycle. The final payout is determined based on the entire performance period. Mr. Bensen will not receive any payout under the CPUP until after the end of the performance period on December 31, 2009.
 
The performance measures that will be used to calculate CPUP payouts for the 2007-2009 performance cycle are:
 
    To calculate the final payout, the amount based on the above performance measures will be adjusted by a multiplier based on McDonaldss cumulative total shareholder return versus the S&P 500 Index for the performance period, which may result in final payouts being increased or decreased by up to 15%.
   
 
The maximum final payout that Mr. Bensen can earn under the CPUP is 230% of the prorated target award.
