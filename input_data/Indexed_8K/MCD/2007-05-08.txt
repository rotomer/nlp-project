OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that global comparable sales rose 4.8% in April. Systemwide sales for McDonald's restaurants worldwide increased 9.6% for the month, 6.0% in constant currencies.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner said, The ongoing strength of our performance reflects the success of our efforts to make McDonalds a relevant and convenient eating-out choice for customers worldwide.
In the U.S., McDonalds market-leading breakfast menu, popular Happy Meals and the ongoing success of the Snack Wrap contributed to comparable sales rising 3.5%.
The momentum of McDonalds European business continued in April with comparable sales up 3.5% against a strong prior year comparison. Leading this performance was robust sales growth in France and Russia, partially offset by results in Germany.
Comparable sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa rose 10.3%, primarily due to strong performance in Japan and China. Initiatives such as extended hours, breakfast and locally relevant menu offerings helped drive the increase.
Skinner added,
