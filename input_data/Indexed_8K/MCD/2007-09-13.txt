OAK BROOK, IL -- McDonald's
Board of Directors today declared an annual cash
dividend of $1.50 per share
 
payable on December 3, 2007 to shareholders of record as of November
 
15, 2007. This is 50% higher than the Companys 2006 dividend of $1.00
 
per share.
 Jim Skinner, McDonalds Chief Executive Officer, said, "Todays dividend increase is a testament to our focus on being better, not just bigger. Weve improved our menu, marketing and restaurant experience and at the same time taken action to enhance the strength and reliability of our substantial cash flow. Our efforts have delivered exceptional business performance and created significant value for our owner/operators, suppliers and shareholders.
   
 "Our business momentum, strong stable cash flow, borrowing capacity and anticipated future capital needs reinforce our view that cash available for dividends and share repurchase will continue to grow. As a result, while maintaining a strong credit rating, we expect to return $15 billion to $17 billion in cash to shareholders from 2007 through 2009, subject to business and market conditions. Todays dividend increase is a part of this commitment along with our ongoing share repurchases, which have totaled $2.4 billion year-to-date August."
   
 McDonalds has raised its dividend each and every year since paying its first
   
dividend in 1976. At $1.50 per share, the Companys dividend is now more than six times higher than the 23.5 cents per share paid in 2002.
