EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
OAK BROOK, IL - McDonald's Corporation announced today that global comparable sales rose 5.9% in September and 6.9% in the third quarter 2007. Systemwide sales for McDonald's restaurants worldwide increased 11.5% for the month (7.2% in constant currencies) and 11.8% for the quarter (8.1% in constant currencies).
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner said,
"These strong results reflect just how well McDonalds continues to appeal to customers around the world. Initiatives surrounding value, menu choice and compelling marketing are strengthening our brands relevance and driving ongoing global sales momentum."
Value, breakfast and beverage strategies drove the U.S. comparable sales growth of 3.5% in September.
Momentum continued in Europe with comparable sales up 5.7% in September. Nearly all markets in Europe, led by France, the U.K. and Russia, posted a strong performance.
Robust sales growth in Japan, Australia, China and most other markets in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa drove comparable sales up 12.0% in September, and to a 10-year record high of 11.4% for the quarter.

Earnings Per Share
Third quarter 2007 earnings per share is expected to be $0.89. This includes $0.83 per share from continuing operations and an after-tax gain of $0.06 per share from the sale of Boston Market. Currency translation benefited earnings from continuing operations by $0.03 per share,
 
and growth in other operating income contributed earnings of $0.02 per share.
In connection with the Latin America developmental license transaction (Latam) that closed in early August, the Company recorded an additional $0.04 per share of expense that was offset by a $0.04 per share tax benefit. The $0.04 per share tax benefit relates to utilizing more of the Latam capital loss as a result of realizing a capital gain on the sale of Boston Market.
Third quarter 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.68, which included $0.01 per share of impairment and other charges primarily in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa.
