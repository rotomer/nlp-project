Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong operating results for the third quarter fueled by comparable sales growth. Quarterly highlights included:
 
 
 
 
 
Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner commented, "Our strategic focus on building the McDonald's business by "being better not just bigger" and our global Plan to Win have combined to create enduring business momentum. By offering menu innovations and everyday conveniences that address the needs of our on-the-go customers, we are keeping our brand relevant and in demand. Third quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter that we've posted positive comparable sales across all segments and demonstrates that our strategy is yielding results."
McDonald's U.S. performance continues to be fueled by initiatives that provide value to the consumer. For the quarter, McDonald's U.S. generated strong operating income growth despite industry-wide commodity and labor headwinds.
Europe's focus on delivering an improved customer experience along with unique marketing and locally appealing menu options drove robust sales and profitability for the third quarter.
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa posted an 11.4% comparable sales increase for the third quarter  the segment's highest quarterly performance in 10 years. Our ongoing commitment to everyday affordability, convenience and locally relevant menu choice contributed to the segment's strong top-line and bottom-line results.
Jim Skinner continued, "We are leveraging our current momentum with disciplined practices that enhance long-term shareholder value while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. During the quarter, we increased our cash return to shareholders target to $15 billion to $17 billion in 2007 through 2009 and raised our annual dividend by 50% to $1.50 per share. These commitments reflect confidence in our business outlook and in the strength and reliability of our future cash flows.
"The McDonald's business is strong. We are aligned as one System, behind one plan and focused on elevating our performance to even higher levels."

In addition to the reported results for the quarter and nine months shown above, consolidated results for these periods are presented below, excluding the impact of the Company's sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as "Latam". While the Company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.
The following tables present reconciliations of the key consolidated highlights for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 to the highlights excluding the impact of the Latam transaction.
 
Table of Contents
 
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the third quarter 2007, net income was $1,071.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.89. In August 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result, Boston Market's results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as income from discontinued operations of $67.5 million or $0.06 per share. Income from continuing operations was $1,003.7 million or $0.83 per share. These results included a net benefit of $3.9 million related to the Company's sale of its business in Latam to a developmental licensee.
For the third quarter 2006, net income was $843.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.68, which included income from continuing operations of $841.7 million or $0.68 per share and $1.6 million of income from discontinued operations related to both Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) and Boston Market. The 2006 results also included $13.1 million after tax or $0.01 per share of impairment and other charges primarily in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA).
For the nine months 2007, net income was $1,121.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.92, which included income from continuing operations of $1,061.8 million or $0.87 per share and $60.1 million or $0.05 per share of income from discontinued operations related to Boston Market. The results for the nine months 2007 included $1,577.7 million or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. Excluding the impact of the Latam transaction, income from continuing operations was $2,639.5 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.17.
 
Table of Contents
For the nine months 2006, net income was $2,302.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.83 per share. The 2006 results included income from continuing operations of $2,114.4 million or $1.68 per share and $188.3 million or $0.15 per share of income from discontinued operations related to both Chipotle and Boston Market. In addition to the impairment charges noted above for the third quarter 2006, results for the nine months 2006 also included $0.07 per share of impairment and other charges primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns, as well as $0.01 per share of net incremental expense primarily related to a tax law change in Canada.
During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 18.1 million shares of its stock for $927.1 million, bringing the total repurchases for the first nine months of 2007 to 53.8 million shares or $2.6 billion.
Conversion of Certain Markets to Developmental License
In the third quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of Latam to a developmental licensee organization led by Woods Staton, a valued member of the McDonald's System for more than 20 years. Under a developmental license, a local licensee owns the business, including the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonald's Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Under this arrangement, the Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital.
Based on approval by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was "held for sale" as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, . As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. In the third quarter, the Company recorded an additional $53 million of charges in connection with the transaction. The total charges for the nine months included $892 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $680 million in cash proceeds received, subject to working capital adjustments. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $773 million recorded in shareholders' equity. The Company has recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the "held for sale" criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald's consolidated balance sheet.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets
The buyers of the Company's operations in Latam have entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations, (i) to pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) to commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonald's restaurants over the first three years and pay an initial franchise fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) to commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants.
Based on 2006 results for Latam, the annualized consolidated financial statement impact of this transaction is expected to consist of:

Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because it believes they better represent the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share for the quarter and nine months, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, British Pound and Australian Dollar.
 
Table of Contents
Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends for McDonald's restaurants. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald's restaurants, including those operated by the Company, franchisees and affiliates, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter and nine months. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Discontinued Operations
 
 
In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in a tax-free gain to McDonald's of $32.0 million to reflect an increase in the carrying value of the Company's investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonald's sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61.4 million and an additional gain of $13.6 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonald's sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $267.4 million and a gain of $127.8 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In addition, Chipotle's net income for the third quarter and nine months 2006 was $3.2 million and $17.5 million, respectively.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. By far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise, developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our plan to continue reducing the number of Company-operated restaurants may be difficult to achieve for many reasons, and the change in ownership mix may not affect our results as we now expect. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate, as well as our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand and may adversely affect our results.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
We developed the Plan to Win to address the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
Our plans call for further reductions in Company-operated restaurants by franchising them or entering into developmental license agreements. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and will be affected by the following:
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes), terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events (such as the potential spread of avian flu) can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels and in turn the McDonald's System and our results and prospects in the affected markets. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
