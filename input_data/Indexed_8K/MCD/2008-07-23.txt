Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong operating results for the second quarter, driven by global comparable sales growth of 6.1%.
"Our strategic focus on putting the customer first in everything we do continues to yield outstanding operating results," said Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "For the quarter, we grew comparable sales and guest counts across all geographic segments and delivered increased profitability. These results are a testament to the strength and resilience of McDonald's Plan to Win."
McDonald's reported the following second quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
Jim Skinner continued, "Our ongoing performance demonstrates that McDonald's is a trusted and familiar brand offering value, convenience and choice worldwide. We're operating from a position of strength with double-digit operating income growth in Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and solid quarterly results in the U.S."
For McDonald's U.S., comparable sales were up 3.4% and operating income increased 6% for the quarter. The U.S. business continues to increase sales and guest counts through initiatives that provide value and variety to the consumer. The four key growth strategies of chicken, breakfast, beverages and convenience drove results with the nationwide launch of the Southern Style Chicken Biscuit and Sandwich and locally relevant beverage promotions.
In Europe, comparable sales increased 7.4% and operating income rose 29% (13% in constant currencies) as emphasis on delivering an improved customer experience along with unique marketing and signature menu options drove performance. Europe's three-tier menu offerings, innovative new products and restaurant reimaging continue to give customers even more reasons to visit McDonald's.
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa delivered strong results, led by Australia and China along with broad-based strength throughout the segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 8.8%, driving operating income up 37% (22% in constant currencies). Throughout Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, McDonald's everyday value, convenience and appealing product offerings are fueling results.
 
Skinner added, "Around the world, McDonald's is powered by the contributions of a dedicated System of owner/operators, suppliers and employees who are committed to satisfying every customer, every time. I am confident that our collective focus on delivering great-tasting quality food at a compelling value will continue to drive McDonald's momentum."
KEY HIGHLIGHTS  CONSOLIDATED

n/m Comparisons are not meaningful due to the impact of the Latin America transaction described below.
In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as "Latam." Under the new ownership structure, the Company now receives only royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.
In addition to the reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007 shown above, consolidated results for these periods are presented throughout this report excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. Management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.
The following tables present reconciliations of the key consolidated highlights for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 to the highlights excluding the net impact of the impairment charge from the Latam transaction.

n/m Comparisons are not meaningful due to the impact of the Latin America transaction described below.
In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as "Latam." Under the new ownership structure, the Company now receives only royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.
In addition to the reported results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007 shown above, consolidated results for these periods are presented throughout this report excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. Management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.
The following tables present reconciliations of the key consolidated highlights for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 to the highlights excluding the net impact of the impairment charge from the Latam transaction.
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share
For the second quarter and six months ended June 2008, net income was $1,190.5 million and $2,136.6 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.04 and $1.85, respectively. Both periods benefited by $109.0 million or $0.10 per share due to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Pret A Manger.
For the second quarter 2007, the Company reported a net loss of $711.7 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.60. The 2007 results included $1.6 billion of net expense after tax or $1.31 per share related to the Company's sale of its business in Latam to a developmental licensee. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.33 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 benefit due to eliminating depreciation in mid-April 2007 on the assets in Latam in accordance with accounting rules. Excluding the impact of the Latam transaction, net income was $869.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.71. The 2007 results also included a net loss of $3.3 million from discontinued operations related to Boston Market, which was sold in August 2007. Due to the net loss in second quarter 2007, common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculations. Common stock equivalents of 23.2 million were added to the weighted average shares outstanding of 1,193.7 million to compute the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used in the per share calculations excluding the Latam transaction.
For the first six months of 2007, net income was $50.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.04, which included the $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense after tax related to the Latam transaction. Excluding the impact of the Latam transaction, net income was $1,632.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.34. The 2007 results also included a net loss of $7.4 million from discontinued operations related to Boston Market.
During the second quarter 2008, the Company repurchased 13.3 million shares of its stock for $787.9 million, bringing the total repurchases for the first six months of 2008 to 50.4 million shares or $2.8 billion. During the second quarter 2008, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share or $421.6 million, bringing the total dividends paid for the first six months of 2008 to $848.0 million.
Conversion of Certain Markets to Developmental License
In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which total about 1,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under a developmental license, a local licensee owns the business, including the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonald's Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Under this arrangement, the Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital. As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company's revenues generated from these markets were less than in the prior year.
The buyers of the Company's operations in Latam have entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations, to pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements.
 
Table of Contents
Based on approval by the Company's Board of Directors, which occurred on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was "held for sale" as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, . As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and cash proceeds, less costs of disposal. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charge also included historical foreign currency translation losses recorded in shareholders' equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $12.8 million in connection with this transaction. The tax benefit was minimal in the second quarter 2007 due to the Company's inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. As a result of meeting the "held for sale" criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald's consolidated balance sheet.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share for the quarter and six months, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, including those operated by the Company, franchisees and affiliates, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised and affiliated sales for the quarter. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. By far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise, developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand and may adversely affect our results.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
In recent years, we have reduced the number of Company-operated restaurants and we are planning further reductions by franchising Company-operated restaurants or entering into developmental license agreements. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and will be affected by the following:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
 
 
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
