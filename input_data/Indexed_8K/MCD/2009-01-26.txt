Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong operating results for the fourth quarter and the year, driven by global comparable sales growth.
"2008 was a strong year for McDonald's," said Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "Through our strategic focus on menu choice, food quality and value, the average number of customers served per day increased to more than 58 million in 2008. Comparable sales and guest counts were positive across all segments for every quarter, and the Company delivered double-digit growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and the year. These accomplishments validate the strength and resilience of McDonald's Plan to Win."
Full year 2008 highlights included:
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth quarter highlights included:
 
 
 
McDonald's U.S. delivered very strong results for the quarter and year by seizing opportunities in the key growth areas of chicken, breakfast, beverages and convenience. Throughout 2008, the U.S. built brand loyalty by reinforcing the Company's dedication to value, convenience and menu variety with the addition of the Southern Style Chicken biscuit and sandwich, drive-thru enhancements to improve service and ongoing expansion of McCafe specialty coffees.
In Europe, ongoing efforts to strengthen brand relevance generated impressive fourth quarter and full year results. Full year comparable sales were positive in every European market as more customers enjoyed McDonald's combination of seasonal and premium menu selections, compelling value options and inviting restaurants.
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa posted robust comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter and year. Strong results across the segment were driven by operations excellence and a sharp focus on breakfast, convenience and everyday affordability.
 
Jim Skinner added, "Our disciplined approach to financial management continues to be an important component of McDonald's success. We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value by investing capital prudently, optimizing our restaurant ownership mix and returning cash to shareholders. To date, we have returned $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases toward our target of $15 billion to $17 billion for 2007 through 2009. For 2009, we plan to invest $2.1 billion of capital to open about 1,000 new McDonald's restaurants and reinvest in our existing locations."
Jim Skinner concluded, "I am pleased with McDonald's 2008 results, which were achieved through the dedication of our Owner/Operators, suppliers and employees who provide an exceptional restaurant experience for our customers each and every day. McDonald's begins 2009 with six years of momentum, a business model that has delivered even in challenging economic conditions and January sales that remain strong. I am confident that our alignment behind the Plan to Win and our focus on what matters most to customers will continue to generate positive results for our System and shareholders."

In August 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result, Boston Market's results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations for the full year 2007.
In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as "Latam." Under the new ownership structure, the Company now receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.
In addition to the reported results shown above, consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2007 are presented below excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. Management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charges are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.

Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, net income was $985.3 million and $4,313.2 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $0.87 and $3.76, respectively. Results for the year benefited by a $109.0 million, or $0.09 per share, after tax gain on the sale of the Company's minority interest in Pret A Manger.
For the fourth quarter 2007, net income was $1,273.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.06. These results included a net tax benefit of $396.4 million or $0.33 per share related to the completion of an IRS examination of the Company's 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns and tax developments in the quarter related to foreign operations, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada.
For the full year 2007, net income was $2,395.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2,335.0 million or $1.93 per share, which included $1,578.6 million or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation in mid-April 2007 on the assets in Latam. In addition, full year 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288.4 million or $0.24 per share related to the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60.1 million or $0.05 per share.
During the fourth quarter 2008, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of its stock for $143.6 million, bringing the total repurchases for 2008 to 69.7 million shares or $4.0 billion. During the fourth quarter 2008, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or $557.7 million, bringing the total dividends paid for 2008 to $1.8 billion.

Conversion of Certain Markets to Developmental License
In the third quarter 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under a developmental license, a local licensee owns the business, including the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonald's Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Under this arrangement, the Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital. As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.
The buyers of the Company's operations in Latam have entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations, to pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements.
Based on approval by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was "held for sale" as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, . As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The total charges for the year included the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and cash proceeds, less costs of disposal. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses recorded in shareholders' equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in connection with this transaction. The tax benefit was minimal in 2007 due to the Company's inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. As a result of meeting the "held for sale" criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald's consolidated balance sheet.

Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results for the quarter as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most currencies of foreign markets in which we operate, primarily driven by the weaker Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results for the year, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound.
Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. For franchisees, these fees include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees. For developmental licensees and affiliates, these fees include royalties based on a percent of sales and, in some cases, initial fees.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, including those operated by the Company, franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES
 
 
 
 
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates along with franchised, developmental licensee and affiliated sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees, by developmental licensees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised, developmental licensee and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy and expects the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants to result in lower consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent and/or royalties. In addition, the Company expects a decrease in Company-operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars, while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise, developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand and may adversely affect our results.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the current uncertain economic conditions, could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
In recent years, we have reduced the number of Company-operated restaurants and we are planning further reductions by franchising Company-operated restaurants or entering into developmental license agreements. Whether and when we can achieve these plans, as well as their success, is uncertain and will be affected by the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
