Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, driven by positive global comparable sales in every area of the world. In constant currencies, the Company posted higher revenues, operating income and earnings per share compared with the prior year.
"We're driving results by staying focused on our global business strategy, the Plan to Win," said Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "In today's economic environment, our performance speaks to the strength of our plan and McDonald's ongoing commitment to our customers around the world."
McDonald's reported the following second quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Jim Skinner continued, "As consumers find themselves more cash-strapped and time-challenged, they continue to count on McDonald's for value, convenience and variety across our menu. The ongoing appeal of McDonald's is a testament to the dedication of our owner/operators, suppliers and employees who provide an exceptional restaurant experience for each customer, every time."
McDonald's U.S. delivered solid comparable sales for the second quarter and drove operating income up 5%. The U.S. business gained market share during the quarter with a balanced focus on classic menu favorites like the Big Mac, beverage value offerings and the national launch of the McCaf premium coffee line-up.
McDonald's Europe delivered strong second quarter comparable sales led by performance in the U.K., France and Russia. In constant currencies, Europe's second quarter operating income rose 10%. Alignment behind Europe's key priorities of enhancing local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience and building brand transparency continues to deliver results.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), Australia led the segment's second quarter operating income increase of 34% in constant currencies. Emphasis on core menu favorites, convenience, value and breakfast, along with a sharp focus on improving operations and customer service, contributed to results.
Jim Skinner concluded, "I am pleased with McDonald's results and remain confident in our outlook for the year. As we begin the third quarter, we expect to report July consolidated comparable sales similar to or better than June."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to the results of McDonald's Corporation for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results for the quarter and six months as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most currencies of foreign markets in which we operate, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and Canadian Dollar.
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009, net income was $1,093.7 million and $2,073.2 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $0.98 and $1.85, respectively. Results benefited by an after tax gain of $11.1 million, or $0.01 per share, for the quarter and $58.5 million, or $0.05 per share, for the six months, related to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox). Results were negatively impacted due to the effect of foreign currency translation by $0.09 per share and $0.17 per share for the quarter and six months, respectively.
For the second quarter and six months ended June 2008, net income was $1,190.5 million and $2,136.6 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.04 and $1.85, respectively. Both periods benefited by an after tax gain of $109.0 million or $0.10 per share due to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Pret A Manger.
 
Table of Contents
During the second quarter 2009, the Company repurchased 14.4 million shares of its stock for $807.2 million, bringing the total repurchases for 2009 to 29.0 million shares or $1.6 billion. During the second quarter 2009, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or $547.8 million, bringing the total dividends paid for 2009 to $1.1 billion.
Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
REVENUES

Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is expected to negatively impact consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. In addition, the Company expects a decrease in Company-operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars. The impact on margin percentages will vary based on sales and operating costs of refranchised restaurants.
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, including those operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.
COMPARABLE SALES
 
 
 
 
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and franchised sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is also highly fragmented and competitive. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. We also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic environments could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. For example, the current global recession has been characterized by slowing economies, rising unemployment, declining wages, constrained credit conditions and volatile financial markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer habits and spending, including in our major markets and markets that we expect will be drivers of our long-term growth. If these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our results, depending on the timing and strength of a recovery.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns, while meeting our business needs and customer expectations.
Our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, affects our results. The shift reduces consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. It also reduces Company-operated margin dollars while increasing franchised margin dollars, with the impact on margin percentages varying based on sales and operating costs of the refranchised restaurants. Our refranchising strategy can also expose us to risks, including the following:
 
 
 
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
