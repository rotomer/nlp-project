Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, fueled by positive comparable sales in every area of the world. In constant currencies, the Company posted higher revenues, operating income and earnings per share compared with the prior year.
"Alignment behind McDonald's long-term business strategy, the Plan to Win, is clear as our growth continues to be a systemwide effort with each area of the world contributing," said McDonald's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Skinner. "McDonald's global results demonstrate the resilience of our strategies and our ability to execute successfully."

Jim Skinner continued, "The consistent strength of McDonald's business is the result of our commitment to the customer. We are keeping the McDonald's brand in demand and growing market share around the world by serving great tasting food at an outstanding value in a way that's convenient to today's consumers."
For the quarter, the U.S. generated solid comparable sales and drove an operating income increase of 6%. The ongoing appeal of McDonald's core menu along with favorable consumer response to the new premium Angus Third Pounders and McCaf espresso-based coffees fueled the U.S. results.
McDonald's Europe delivered strong third quarter comparable sales driving a 10% increase in operating income in constant currencies. Locally relevant premium products and promotions combined with compelling value drove the segment's quarterly performance.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), operating income for the quarter rose 21% in constant currencies with Australia and China leading the segmentEmphasis on convenience, value, operations excellence and core menu are enhancing consumer appeal and driving growth across APMEA.
.
Jim Skinner concluded, "We begin the fourth quarter from a position of strength, and I am confident that our focus on the customer and commitment to financial discipline will continue to deliver long-term profitable growth for our System and our shareholders. For October, despite a declining informal eating out market around the world, we expect consolidated comparable sales to remain positive."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to the results of McDonald's Corporation for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results for the quarter and nine months as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most currencies of foreign markets in which we operate, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, net income was $1,261.0 million and $3,334.2 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.15 and $3.00, respectively. Results for the nine months benefited by an after tax gain of $58.8 million or $0.05 per share related to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox). Results were negatively impacted due to the effect of foreign currency translation by $0.05 per share and $0.22 per share for the quarter and nine months, respectively.
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 2008, net income was $1,191.3 million and $3,327.9 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.05 and $2.89, respectively. Results for the nine months benefited by an after tax gain of $109.0 million or $0.09 per share due to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Pret A Manger.
 
Table of Contents
During the third quarter 2009, the Company repurchased 13.6 million shares of its stock for $758.6 million, bringing the total repurchases for 2009 to 42.6 million shares or $2.4 billion. During the third quarter 2009, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or $541.2 million, bringing the total dividends paid for 2009 to $1.6 billion. The Company also declared a fourth quarter 2009 dividend of $0.55 per share, reflecting an increase of 10% over the third quarter.
Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
REVENUES

Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. In addition, there is a corresponding decrease in Company-operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars. The impact on margin percentages varies based on sales and operating costs of refranchised restaurants.
 
 
 
 
Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, including those operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.

COMPARABLE SALES
 
 
 
 
 
The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and franchised sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out ("IEO") segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current economic environment has increased consumer focus on value, heightening pricing pressures across the industry, which could affect our ability to continue to grow sales despite the strength of our Brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results. In particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter" presents challenges for our Brand.
The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win, particularly as the global economy emerges from recession.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by slowing economies, rising unemployment, declining wages, constrained credit and volatile financial markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer spending and habits. Moreover, the timing and strength of a recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that affect our ability to manage the impact of these conditions are the following:

Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix.
Our refranchising strategy involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. When we refranchise a restaurant, it reduces consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. It also reduces Company-operated margin dollars while increasing franchised margin dollars, with the impact on margin percentages varying based on sales and operating costs of the refranchised restaurants.
Our refranchising strategy can also expose us to risks, including the following:
 
 
 
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
