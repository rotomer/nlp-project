Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong results for the third quarter driven by growth across all areas of the world.
"McDonald's customer focus, menu innovation and the ongoing modernization of our restaurants continue to drive our business momentum," said Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "For the third quarter, we grew comparable sales and customer visits around the world and delivered increased profitability. As we continue to invest in our business and extend the McDonald's brand, I am confident that we will create even more ways to satisfy consumers looking for high quality, great tasting food that's convenient and affordable."
The Company reported the following highlights for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Company previously announced the following:
 
McDonald's U.S. continues to drive increased sales and traffic through customer-focused initiatives that provide variety and value. In the third quarter, the nationwide promotion of McCaf Frapps and Smoothies, McDonald's classic core favorites and the everyday affordability of the Dollar Menu were key contributors to the segment's robust comparable sales growth and 7% increase in operating income.
McDonald's Europe delivered comparable sales increases and grew operating income by 3% (12% in constant currencies) in the third quarter, despite a challenging informal eating out marketplace. Throughout Europe, McDonald's emphasis on providing signature menu favorites across all price-tiers, reimaging to create a more inviting restaurant experience and extending McDonald's convenience with expanded operating hours resonated with consumers and contributed to the segment's results.
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa's (APMEA) third quarter results reflect broad-based strength with strong comparable sales increases in many markets, led by Japan, China and Australia. Across the segment, compelling value, unique limited-time offerings and daypart expansion generated increased consumer demand for McDonald's in APMEA and contributed to the segment's 22% operating income growth (15% in constant currencies).
Jim Skinner concluded, "Our alignment behind McDonald's Plan to Win has never been stronger. Collectively, we remain focused on becoming our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink. I am confident that we will continue to provide the outstanding restaurant experience customers expect from McDonald's while delivering profitable growth for our System and our shareholders over the long-term. As we begin the final quarter of 2010, our momentum continues with October global comparable sales expected to increase 5% to 6%."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to the results of McDonald's Corporation for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results for the quarter due to the weaker Euro and British Pound, partly offset by the stronger Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results for the nine months driven by the stronger Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro.
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010, net income was $1,388.4 million and $3,704.0 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.29 and $3.42, respectively. Results for the nine months included after tax impairment charges of $36.8 million, or $0.03 per share, related to restaurant closings in Japan in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the market's restaurant portfolio. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.03 per share on diluted earnings per share for the quarter and a positive impact of $0.03 per share for the nine months.
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, net income was $1,261.0 million and $3,334.2 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.15 and $3.00, respectively. Results benefited from an after tax gain of $58.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for the nine months due to the sale of the Company's minority interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox).

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed.

The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and franchised sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out (IEO) segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current environment has also increased consumer focus on value, heightening pricing pressures across the industry, which could affect our ability to continue to grow sales despite the strength of our Brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, as well as by the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter."
The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, high unemployment, constrained credit and volatile financial markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending. Moreover, the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.
Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics, or expectations about them, can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
