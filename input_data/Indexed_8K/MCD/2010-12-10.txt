Item 5.03.  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On December 8, 2010, McDonald's Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (the "Company") executed and filed a Certificate of Elimination of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, (the "Junior Preferred Stock") with the Secretary of State of Delaware ("Secretary of State"), thereby removing the Certificate of Designations of the Junior Preferred Stock from the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Elimination became effective upon filing. The Junior Preferred Stock was created pursuant to the Company's Rights Agreement entered into between the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, as successor rights agent, on December 13, 1988, as amended (the "Rights Agreement"). The Rights Agreement expired in accordance with its terms on December 28, 1998 and was not renewed. No shares of the Junior Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding upon filing of the Certificate of Elimination. A copy of the Certificate of Elimination is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference.
Also on December 8, 2010, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Restated Certificate of Incorporation as adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which was effective upon filing, does not further amend the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and only restates and integrates into a single instrument all prior amendments to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation. A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference.
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

It is also the intention that the foregoing clauses shall be construed as powers as well as objects and purposes; that the Corporation shall be authorized to conduct its business or hold property in any part of the United States and its possessions, and foreign countries; that the foregoing enumeration of specific powers shall not be held to limit or restrict in any manner the general powers of the Corporation; and that generally the Corporation shall be authorized to exercise and enjoy all other powers conferred on corporations by the laws of Delaware.
 
FOURTH:  The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Three Billion Six Hundred Sixty-Five Million (3,665,000,000), consisting of Three Billion Five Hundred Million (3,500,000,000) shares of Common Stock with one cent ($.01) par value and One Hundred Sixty-Five Million (165,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock without par value.
Each share of Common Stock shall be equal to every other share of Common Stock in every respect. Subject to any exclusive voting rights which may vest in holders of Preferred Stock under the provisions of any series of the Preferred Stock established by the Board of Directors pursuant to authority herein provided, the shares of Common Stock shall entitle the holders thereof to one vote for each share upon all matters upon which stockholders have the right to vote.
(1)      Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each of such series to have such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as are stated and expressed in this Article and in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series adopted by the Board of Directors as hereinafter provided.
(2)      Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors subject to the provisions of this Article to authorize the issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each series, to fix by resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series:
(a)      The number of shares to constitute such series and the distinctive designations thereof;
(b)      The dividend rate or rates to which such shares shall be entitled and the restrictions, limitations and conditions upon the payment of such dividends, whether dividends shall be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the date or dates from which dividends shall accumulate, the dates on which dividends, if declared, shall be payable, and the preferences or relations to the dividends payable on any other series of Preferred Stock;
(c)      Whether or not all or any part of the shares of such series shall be redeemable, and if so, the limitations and restrictions with respect to such redemptions, the manner of selecting shares of such series for redemption if less than all shares are to be redeemed, and the amount, if any, in addition to any accrued dividends thereon, which the holder of shares of such series shall be entitled to receive upon the redemption thereof, which amount may vary at different redemption dates and may be different with respect to shares redeemed through the operation of any retirement or sinking fund and with respect to shares otherwise redeemed;
(d)      The amount in addition to any accrued dividends thereon which the holders of shares of such series shall be entitled to receive upon the voluntary or involuntary
 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, which amount may vary depending on whether such liquidation, dissolution or winding up is voluntary or involuntary and, if voluntary, may vary at different dates;
(e)      Whether or not the shares of such series shall be subject to the operation of a purchase, retirement or sinking fund, and, if so, whether such purchase, retirement or sinking fund shall be cumulative or non-cumulative, the extent and the manner in which such fund shall be applied to the purchase or redemption of the shares of such series for retirement or to other corporate purposes and the terms and provisions relative to the operation thereof;
(f)      Whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of stock of any other class or classes, or of any other series of the same class, and if so convertible or exchangeable, the price or prices or the rate or rates of conversion or exchange and the method, if any, of adjusting the same;
(g)      The voting powers, if any, of such series in addition to the voting powers provided by law; except that such powers shall not include the right to have more than one vote per share;
(h)      Any other preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall not be inconsistent with law or with this Article.
Notwithstanding the fixing of the number of shares constituting a particular series upon the issuance thereof, the Board of Directors may at any time thereafter authorize the issuance of additional shares of the same series, or decrease the number of shares constituting such series (but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding).
(3)      All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall be identical with all other shares of the same series except that shares of any one series issued at different times may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative; and all series shall rank equally and be identical in all respects, except as permitted by the foregoing provisions of paragraph B. (2).
(4)      (a)      The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive cash dividends when and as declared by the Board of Directors at such rate per share per annum, cumulatively if so provided, and with such preferences, as shall have been fixed by the Board of Directors, before any dividends shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, and such dividends on each series of the Preferred Stock shall cumulate, if at all, from and after the dates fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to such cumulation. Accrued dividends shall bear no interest.
(b)      If dividends on the Preferred Stock are not declared in full then dividends shall be declared ratably on all shares of stock of each series of equal preference in proportion to the respective unpaid cumulative dividends, if any, to the end of the then current dividend period. No ratable distribution shall be declared or set apart for payment with respect to any series until accumulated dividends in arrears in full have been declared and paid on any series senior in preference.
 
(c)      Unless dividends on all outstanding shares of series of the Preferred Stock having cumulative dividend rights shall have been fully paid for all past dividend periods, and unless all required sinking fund payments, if any, shall have been made or provided for, no dividend (except a dividend payable in Common Stock or in any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock) shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock.
(d)      Subject to the foregoing provisions, the Board of Directors may declare and pay dividends on the Common Stock and on any class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, to the extent permitted by law. After full dividends for the current dividend period, and, in the case of Preferred Stock having cumulative dividend rights after all prior dividends have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to all further dividends declared and paid in such current dividend period.
(5)      In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Corporation shall be made to or set apart for the holders of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, the holders of the shares of each series of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the amount per share fixed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of the shares of such series, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but they shall be entitled to no further payment. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among such holders ratably in accordance with the respective amount which would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this paragraph B. (5), the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation or a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.
(6)      Shares of any series of Preferred Stock which have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Company (excluding shares purchased and retired, whether through the operation of a retirement or sinking fund or otherwise, and shares which, if convertible or exchangeable, have been converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of any other class or classes) shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock or as part of any other series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock.
(7)      Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the authorizing resolutions, none of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any voting rights and the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors
 
and for all other purposes. So long as any shares of any series of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, irrespective of series, either expressed in writing (to the extent permitted by law) or by their affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose: (i) adopt any amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or take any other action which in any material respect adversely affects any preference, power, special right, or other term of the Preferred Stock or the holders thereof, (ii) create or issue any class of stock entitled to any preference over the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends, or the distribution of capital assets, (iii) increase the aggregate number of shares constituting the authorized Preferred Stock or (iv) create or issue any other class of stock entitled to any preference on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or the distribution of capital assets.
(8)      If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any obligations to retire shares of the Preferred Stock are not paid in full in the case of all series with respect to which such obligations exist, the number of shares of each of such series to be retired pursuant to any such obligations shall be in proportion to the respective amounts which would be payable on account of such obligations if all amounts payable in respect of such series were discharged in full.
(9)      The shares of Preferred Stock may be issued by the Corporation from time to time for such consideration as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any and all shares for which the consideration so fixed shall have been paid or delivered shall be deemed fully paid and nonassessable.
(10)    For the purpose of the provisions of this Article dealing with Preferred Stock or of any resolution of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock or of any certificate filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to any such resolution (unless otherwise provided in any such resolution or certificate):
(a)      The term "outstanding", when used in reference to shares of stock, shall mean issued shares, excluding shares held by the Corporation and shares called for redemption, funds for the redemption of which shall have been set aside or deposited in trust;
(b)      The amount of dividends "accrued" on any share of Preferred Stock as at any dividend date shall be deemed to be the amount of any unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to and including such dividend date, whether or not earned or declared, and the amount of dividends "accrued" on any share of Preferred Stock as at any date other than a dividend date shall be calculated as the amount of any unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to and including the last preceding dividend date, whether or not earned or declared, plus an amount equivalent to interest on the involuntary liquidation value of such share at the annual dividend rate fixed for the shares of such series for the period after such last preceding dividend date to and including the date as of which the calculation is made;
(c)      The term "class or classes of stock of the corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock" shall mean the Common Stock of the Corporation and any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized which shall rank junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.
 
C.      PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL CAPITAL STOCK
No holder of any share or shares of any class of stock of the Corporation shall have any preemptive or preferential right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized or any securities convertible into or carrying any rights to purchase any shares of stock of any class of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized, other than such rights, if any, as the Board of Directors in its discretion from time to time may grant, and at such prices and upon such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors in its discretion may fix.
FIFTH:  The minimum amount of capital with which the Corporation will commence business is One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).
SIXTH:  The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.
SEVENTH:  The private property of the stockholders of the Corporation shall not be subject to the payment of corporate debts to any extent whatsoever.
EIGHTH:  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware the Board of Directors is expressly authorized and empowered:
(a)      In the manner provided in the by-laws of the Corporation to make, alter, amend and repeal the by-laws of the Corporation in any respect not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation;
(b)      By a resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board, to designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation which, to the extent provided in said resolution or resolutions or in the by-laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated in the by-laws of the Corporation or as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors;
(c)      Subject to any applicable provisions of the by-laws of the Corporation then in effect, to determine from time to time, whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders; and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account or book or document of the Corporation, except as conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do by resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation;
(d)      To fix from time to time the amount of the surplus or profits of the Corporation to be reserved as working capital or for any other lawful purpose;
(e)      Without any action by the stockholders, to authorize the borrowing of moneys for any of the purposes of the Corporation and, from time to time without limit as to amount, to authorize and cause the making, execution, issuance, sale or other disposition of
 
promissory notes, drafts, bonds, debentures and other negotiable or non-negotiable instruments and evidences of indebtedness, and the securing of the same by mortgage, pledge, deed of trust or otherwise.
In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised, or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the by-laws of the Corporation.
Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors or of any committee, which shall be ratified by the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation present in person or by proxy and voting at any annual meeting, or at any special meeting called for such purpose, shall, insofar as permitted by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, be as valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation.
The Corporation may enter into contracts or transact business with one or more of its directors, or with any firm of which one or more of its directors are members or with any trust, firm, corporation or association in which any one or more of its directors is a stockholder, director or officer or otherwise interested, and any such contract or transaction shall not be invalidated in the absence of fraud because such director or directors have or may have interests therein which are or might be adverse to the interest of the Corporation, even though the presence and/or vote of the director or directors having such adverse interest shall have been necessary to constitute a quorum and/or to obligate the Corporation upon such contract or transaction, provided that such interests shall have been disclosed to the other directors and a majority of the directors voting shall have approved such contract or transaction; and no director having such adverse interest shall be liable to this Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor thereof, or to any other person for any loss incurred by it under or by reason of any such contract or transaction; nor shall any such director or directors be accountable for any gains or profits realized thereon.
The Corporation shall have power to indemnify any and all of its directors or officers or former directors or officers or any person who may have served at its request as a director or officer of another corporation in which it owns shares of capital stock or of which it is a creditor against liabilities and expenses actually and necessarily incurred by them in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding in which they, or any of them, are made parties, or a party, by reason of being or having been directors or officers or a director or officer of the Corporation, or of such other corporation, except in relation to matters as to which any such director or officer or former director or officer or person shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of duty. Such indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled, under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or otherwise.
NINTH:  Meetings of stockholders may be held outside the State of Delaware, if the by-laws so provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to the laws of the State of Delaware) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the by-laws of the Corporation.
 
Elections of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws of the Corporation shall so provide.
TENTH:  The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to the extent and in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
ELEVENTH:  It is hereby declared to be a proper corporate purpose, reasonably calculated to benefit stockholders, for the Board of Directors to base the response of the Corporation to any "Acquisition Proposal" on the Board of Directors' evaluation of what is in the best interests of the Corporation and for the Board of Directors, in evaluating what is in the best interests of the Corporation, to consider:
(i)      the best interest of the stockholders; for this purpose the Board shall consider, among other factors, not only the consideration being offered in the Acquisition Proposal, in relation to the then current market price, but also in relation to the then current value of the Corporation in a freely negotiated transaction and in relation to the Board of Directors' then estimate of the future value of the Corporation as an independent entity; and
(ii)    such other factors as the Board of Directors determines to be relevant, including, among other factors, the social, legal and economic effects upon franchisees, employees, suppliers, customers and business.
"Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal of any person (a) for a tender offer or exchange offer for any equity security of the Corporation, (b) to merge or consolidate the Corporation with another corporation, or (c) to purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation.
TWELFTH:  Subject to all other applicable provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and to all applicable provisions of the law of Delaware, relating, inter alia, to stockholder approval, the Board of Directors shall have the power to merge or consolidate the Corporation with another corporation or to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation, including its good will and its corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration, which may be in whole or in part shares of stock in, and/or other securities of, any corporation or corporations, as the Board of Directors shall deem expedient and for the best interests of the Corporation, but, regardless of any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if any party to any such transaction shall be a person or entity owning, immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, of record or beneficially, 2% or more of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding having voting power, such power of the Board of Directors shall be exercisable only when and as duly authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding having voting power given at a stockholders' meeting duly called for that purpose; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the power to
 
merge the Corporation with another corporation without action by the stockholders to the extent and in the manner permitted from time to time by the law of Delaware. In determining whether or not any person or entity (the "Primary Holder") owns, of record or beneficially, 2% or more of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding having voting power, there shall be aggregated with all shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by the Primary Holder (a) all shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by any person or entity who or which would be deemed to be controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Primary Holder under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any federal statute enacted to take the place of either or both such statutes or any regulation promulgated under either of such statutes or such successor statutes (an "Affiliate") and (b) all shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by any person or entity acting in concert with the Primary Holder and/or with an Affiliate of the Primary Holder. This Article Twelfth shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding having voting power, given at a stockholders' meeting duly called for that purpose, upon a proposal adopted by the Board of Directors.
THIRTEENTH:  Board of Directors.
(a)      Number, Election and Terms. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than 11 nor more than 24 persons. The exact number of directors within the minimum and maximum limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.
At the 1983 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the 1984 annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at the 1985 annual meeting of stockholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the 1986 annual meeting of stockholders.
At each annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification and election, directors elected to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be elected for a term of office expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election.
(b)      Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office. Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
(c)      Removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative votes of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors.
 
(d)      Amendment, Repeal, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article Thirteenth.
FOURTEENTH:  Stockholder Action. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' written notice only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the Board of Directors.
