Exhibit 99.1
 
OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, driven by growth across all areas of the world.
"McDonald's ongoing momentum reflects our commitment to the customer. By providing relevant food and beverage choices in convenient, modern restaurants, we're giving customers more reasons to visit us more often," said McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "McDonald's global results for the quarter demonstrate the resilience of our Plan to Win and our ability to execute successfully. Comparable sales and guest count increases across all segments, highlighted by June's strong results, drove double-digit operating income and earnings per share growth."
The Company reported the following highlights for the quarter:
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Company announced the following:
 
In the U.S., McDonald's high-quality, affordable food and beverages continued to drive increased sales and guest counts. For the second quarter, U.S. operating income rose 6%, with sales fueled by the McCaf line-up, featuring the new Frozen Strawberry Lemonade, classic core offerings, including Chicken McNuggets and the Big Mac, and breakfast, supported by the new Fruit & Maple Oatmeal.
McDonald's Europe delivered strong comparable sales increases for the second quarter. Operating income increased 24% (10% in constant currencies) led by robust performance in France, the U.K. and Russia. The ongoing restaurant modernization efforts, as well as the segment's focus on premium menu offerings and unique food events, contributed to Europe's second quarter performance.
 
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) delivered strong comparable sales growth, led by China and most other markets. Operating income growth of 34% (19% in constant currencies) reflected the success of the segment's continued commitment to branded affordability, convenience initiatives, such as drive-thru, delivery and extended hours, and innovative marketing tie-ins.
Jim Skinner concluded, "McDonald's continued success reflects the fundamental strength of our business model and unprecedented alignment around our customer-focused strategies. I am pleased with our second quarter performance and confident that the united efforts of our owner-operators, suppliers and employees will drive profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term, despite the continuing challenges of our economic environment. As we begin the third quarter, our momentum continues with July global comparable sales expected to be between 4 and 5%."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to the results of McDonald's Corporation for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011. This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.

The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and franchised sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statement
The information in this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The IEO segment has been contracting in many markets, including some major markets, due to unfavorable economic conditions, and this may continue. Persistently high unemployment rates in many markets have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity. Combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances affect restaurant sales and margin growth despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter," as well as industry marketing practices.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges or restaurant closings. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates and continuing uncertainty in financial and credit markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending. Moreover, the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following:

Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
 
Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.
Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
