OAK BROOK, IL  McDonald's Corporation today announced strong results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011, fueled by broad-based growth across all areas of the world. The Company posted higher revenues, operating income and earnings per share compared with the prior year.
"During 2011, McDonald's continued momentum drove higher profitability and market share gains as we fortified our leadership position around the world," said McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner. "The ongoing strength of McDonald's results is rooted in our Plan to Win with a relentless focus on what matters most to our customers. We are enhancing the customer experience  from our menu and service to our value and convenience  while giving more people more reasons to visit McDonald's more often."

Fourth Quarter highlights included:
 
 
 
 
McDonald's U.S. delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and year, including the segment's highest annual comparable sales performance since 2006. Throughout 2011, the U.S. reinforced the Company's dedication to everyday value, showcased core and new product offerings, increased convenience and further upgraded McDonald's restaurant portfolio with fresh, modern designs that enhance brand relevance.
Europe generated strong comparable sales results and market share gains for the quarter and year in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. France, the U.K., Russia and Germany led the segment's operating income growth for both periods Emphasis on unique promotional food events, fourth-tier menu development and restaurant reimaging continued to provide an appealing customer experience and contributed to the segment's performance.
.
Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa posted strong comparable sales for the quarter and year and delivered double-digit operating income growth for both periods, led by stronger results in many markets.Results across the segment were driven by robust value platforms, brand differentiating conveniences and locally-relevant menu options.
Jim Skinner continued, "As we begin 2012, we are intensifying our efforts toward the global priorities that represent our greatest opportunities under the Plan to Win  optimizing and evolving our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to our Brand. In 2012, we plan to invest about $2.9 billion of capital  roughly half dedicated to opening more than 1,300 new McDonald's restaurants and the other half allocated to investing in our existing locations, including the reimaging of over 2,400 restaurants. I am confident that the investments we are making today will yield long-term value for our shareholders."
Jim Skinner concluded, "I am pleased with McDonald's 2011 results, which were achieved through the dedication of our Owner/Operators, suppliers and employees who provide an exceptional restaurant experience to the nearly 68 million customers we serve every day. McDonald's begins 2012 with nearly nine years of positive momentum, a business model that delivers across a variety of market and economic conditions and global January sales that are expected to remain strong at 5.5% to 6.5%."

THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE
Comparable sales represent sales at all restaurants and comparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Management reviews the increase or decrease in comparable sales and comparable guest counts compared with the same period in the prior year to assess business trends. The number of weekdays and weekend days, referred to as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment, can impact comparable sales and guest counts. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts.
Information in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The purpose of this exhibit is to provide additional information related to the results of McDonald's Corporation for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011, hereafter referred to as the "quarter" and "year". This exhibit should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.1.
Impact of Foreign Currency Translation
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (also referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Dollars in millions, except per share data
 
 
 
 
Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on consolidated operating results for the quarter. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact for the year, driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar as well as most other currencies.
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
For the quarter, net income increased 11% (11% in constant currencies) to $1,376.6 million and diluted earnings per share increased 15% (15% in constant currencies) to $1.33. Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share.
For the year, net income increased 11% (7% in constant currencies) to $5,503.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 15% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.27. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 on diluted earnings per share.
 
Table of Contents
The growth rate on net income was negatively impacted by an increase in the effective income tax rate for the quarter and year. The growth rate on diluted earnings per share benefited from a three percent decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter and year.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of its stock for $344.4 million, bringing total repurchases for the year to 41.9 million shares or $3.4 billion, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share or $715.4 million, bringing the total dividends paid for the year to $2.6 billion.
Revenues
Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales and generally include initial fees.

Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are reviewed by management to assess business trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.

The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and franchised sales. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
The information on this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook. These statements use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan." They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.
Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The IEO segment has been contracting in many markets, including some major markets, due to unfavorable economic conditions, and this may continue. Persistently high unemployment rates in many markets have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity. Combined with increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances affect restaurant sales and margin growth despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, notably the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food "from field to front counter," as well as industry marketing practices.
These risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance.
Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the Plan to Win.
The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and resultspeople, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales, margins and net income.
Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges or restaurant closings. Some macroeconomic conditions have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact. The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates, inflationary pressures and extreme volatility in financial markets worldwide, which has been exacerbated by the significant uncertainty associated with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in certain Eurozone countries. This environment has adversely affected both business and consumer confidence and spending, and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity. These unfavorable conditions are expected to persist for the foreseeable future in many of our most important markets. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results in this environment are the following:

Increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.
Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.
Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:

Our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.
Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
