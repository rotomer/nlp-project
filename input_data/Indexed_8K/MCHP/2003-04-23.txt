EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE [LOGO] MICROCHIP INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT: Gordon Parnell - CFO ... (480) 792-7374 MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS * FY03 NET SALES UP 14% OVER FY02 * FY03 PRO FORMA NET INCOME UP 41% OVER FY02 CHANDLER, Arizona - April 23, 2003 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $159.7 million, down 5% sequentially from $167.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 7% from sales of $148.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter was $33.0 million or 16 cents per diluted share, down 9% sequentially from net income of $36.4 million or 17 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 25% from net income of $26.3 million or 13 cents per diluted share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 were $651.5 million, an increase of 14% from net sales of $571.3 million in the prior fiscal year. On a pro forma basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was $133.9 million, or 64 cents per diluted share, an increase of 41% from net income of $94.8 million, or 45 cents per diluted share in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was $88.2 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, a decrease of 7% from net income of $94.8 million, or 45 cents per diluted share in the prior year. Pro forma diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2003 exclude the effects of the Fab 3 (Puyallup, WA) impairment charge, an in process research and development charge (related to the acquisition of PowerSmart) and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to the Company's revenue recognition policy associated with sales to regional Asian distributors. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP results to its pro forma results is included later in this press release. On March 18, 2003, Microchip announced a change in its revenue recognition policy relating to sales to regional Asian distributors. Microchip changed from recognizing revenue when product is shipped to these distributors (Point of Purchase "POP") to recognizing revenue when these distributors sell the -- MORE --
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS product to their customers (Point of Sale "POS"). Historically, Microchip has recognized revenue from its Americas, European and multinational Asian distributors at POS, but has recognized revenue from regional Asian distributors at POP. The focus on demand creation and sell-through to end customers is in the long-term best interest of Microchip. Revenue recognition at POS as Microchip's sole revenue recognition policy is a more reflective measure of end customer demand. Instituting this change at this point will result in a revenue recognition policy that is uniform throughout the Company. To implement the change in revenue recognition, Microchip has recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $11.4 million as of April 1, 2002, which was the beginning of fiscal year 2003. This represents the amount of income that is now deferred as of that date under the POS method. Quarterly operating results for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2003 have been adjusted to conform to this change in accounting policy. These adjustments resulted in a cumulative revenue reduction of $8.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2003, and a cumulative net income reduction of $2.4 million for the same period. The Company expects to declare a quarterly cash dividend within the next week. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, and has made two cash dividend payments of $.02 per share each. "Microchip's performance in a very difficult environment reflects the hard work, determination and commitment of our global enterprise. In fiscal year 2003, we delivered year over year revenue growth of 14%, achieved substantial market share gains in the 8-bit microcontroller market, attained operating profits among the highest in the industry, and maintained a healthy, debt-free balance sheet. While the year did not finish as we anticipated, our fiscal year 2003 achievements validate that our business model is working solidly. Looking ahead, our business is expected to generate between $175 and $200 million in free cash flows in fiscal year 2004, confirming the overall continued strength of our business enterprise," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "As announced in our April 7, 2003 press release, we are focusing on the closure of Fab 1 (Chandler, AZ) and integrating certain personnel, equipment and processes into our Fab 2 (Tempe, AZ)," Mr. Sanghi continued. "After the completion of the integration process, our gross margins are expected to be approximately 54%, with further improvement anticipated after Fab 4 commences production. "Visibility in the current global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be very difficult. Despite the current uncertainties, we remain confident in the long-term performance of our proprietary microcontroller and analog products," Mr. Sanghi concluded. -- MORE --

Q1 FY2004 OUTLOOK: The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Continuing uncertainty in the global semiconductor industry and low visibility make it very difficult to predict demand and other related matters. Microchip will provide a mid-quarter update on June 10, 2003. See "Conference Call and Updates" section below for details. As indicated below, certain of the Q1 FY2004 Outlook line items are pro forma and exclude the effect of accelerated depreciation due to the announced closure of Fab 1 and other related expenses. Microchip expects these charges will be taken in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, and are currently expected to be between $27 and $33 million, for which Microchip estimates $24 to $29 million will represent accelerated depreciation, and $3 to $4 million will be other related expenses. The majority of the total charges will be reflected in cost of sales. * Net sales for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 is currently anticipated to be between $157 and $164 million (down approximately 2% to up approximately 3% compared to the immediately preceding quarter). -- MORE --
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS * Pro forma gross margins for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003 are expected to be approximately 54%(1).
