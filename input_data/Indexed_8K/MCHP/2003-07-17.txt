MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS "The closure of Fab 1 and consolidation with Fab 2 was achieved flawlessly by our manufacturing team, establishing fab capacity levels that will reduce our future inventory levels. We closed the June quarter with 134 days of inventory, and anticipate being at the top end of our target range of 110 days by the end of the fiscal year," Mr. Sanghi continued. "From a market presence standpoint we were delighted to achieve our goal of reaching the number one position for 8-bit microcontroller shipments. The market share gains we achieved in calendar year 2002 reflect the strength of our brand name and the broad product offering that supports our customers," said Mr. Sanghi. "We anticipate improvement of our business model in the September quarter, with Asia and the Americas being our strongest geographies. We expect net sales to grow sequentially between 1 to 6% in the September quarter," Mr. Sanghi concluded. MICROCHIP'S FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 HIGHLIGHTS: o Microchip achieved the number one position in worldwide 8-bit microcontroller unit shipments, according to industry analyst Gartner Dataquest's recently released 2002 MICROCONTROLLER MARKET SHARE AND UNIT SHIPMENTS report++. From 2001 to 2002, unit sales for Microchip's PIC(R) microcontrollers grew 30 percent, despite challenging business conditions, enabling us to attain the number one ranking. o Microchip set a new quarterly record for shipments of development tools with 12,187 shipped. Sales were led by strong contributions from MPLAB(R) In Circuit Debugger (ICD) 2 and PICkit(TM) 1 Flash Starter Kit. Total cumulative development system shipments now stand at 274,181. o Microchip was named a finalist in the Best Sales Organization category for the American Business Awards. Nicknamed the Stevies(TM), The American Business Awards are the first national, all-encompassing business awards program honoring great performances in the workplace. o Microchip announced the PICDEM(TM) 4 Demonstration Board for the Company's low pin-count PIC(R) Flash microcontrollers, including the recently launched PIC16F and PIC18F microcontroller families - - MORE - -
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS that feature NANOWATT TECHNOLOGY. For $129, designers receive a demonstration tool that offers multiple socket options for increased flexibility and immediate programming and debugging. o Microchip introduced three microcontrollers with integrated transmitters and two receivers, which offers a complete system solution for short-range, uni-directional RF communication supporting frequency bands ranging from 260 - 930 MHz. By combining the rfPIC12F675 microcontroller/transmitters with either the rfRXD0420 receiver or rfRDX0920 receiver, users can easily create a wireless uni-directional communication link for embedded control applications, which can also be combined with the Company's existing rfPIC(TM) devices and KEELOQ(R) encoders to create remote sense and control applications. o At the April Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco, Microchip demonstrated the following products: the PS401/2 PowerSmart(R) Smart Battery System; its first Programmable Gain Amplifier (MCP6S2X); the fixed speed 9600-Baud Infrared Data Association(R)-Standard protocol stack controller (MCP2140); PIC16F microcontrollers featuring NANOWATT TECHNOLOGY; rfPIC transmitters/receivers; PICDEM(TM)4 Demonstration Board; Application Maestro(TM) Software; the MPLAB(R) In-Circuit Emulator (ICE) 4000; and the PICkit(TM) 1 Starter Kit. o The Company expanded its fan-speed control and fan-fault detection family, which features a proprietary fan auto-restart functionality that enables the device to continuously initiate a restart during a fan-fault condition. In addition to simplifying system design by eliminating the need for resetting the fan after a fan-fault condition occurs, the TC64xB devices also enable the user to set a minimum fan speed threshold (TC642B and TC647B) or an auto-shutdown threshold (TC646B, TC648B, and TC649B) to control fan operation when the operating temperature falls to lower levels. The TC642/6/8B devices assert an over-temperature signal to indicate a possible over-heating condition. o Microchip unveiled the low-cost PIC18FXX20 64- and 80-pin TQFP Demonstration Board, the Company's first demonstration board designed for its high pin-count PIC18F Flash microcontrollers. Fully functional right out of the box, the tool demonstrates the digital and analog peripherals of the PIC18FXX20 Flash microcontrollers, and allows for rapid and easy prototyping without the need to design a printed circuit board to support the included PIC18F8720 Flash microcontroller. - - MORE - -
MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS o Expanding its popular PIC18F Flash family, Microchip introduced the PIC18F6520 and PIC18F8520 microcontrollers in 64- and 80-pin TQFP packages with a low-cost 32Kb memory device featuring Microchip's PMOS Electrically Erasable Cell (PEEC) process technology that provides best-in-class erase/write endurance, retention, and disturb reliability for both program and on-chip data EEPROM memory. These new devices are also code-compatible with Microchip's PIC18F452 and PIC18F8720 families of Flash devices, enabling designers to re-use software and hardware in existing platforms, thus lowering overall development costs and time-to-market issues. o Microchip revealed the TC1017 150mA low dropout regulator (LDO) in a tiny, space-saving SC-70 package. Designers can now replace SOT-23 LDOs with a 50 percent smaller footprint solution without compromising performance. The features of this new device improve system performance, reduce board space and minimize system cost, which makes the TC1017 one of the best SC-70 LDO choices for any battery-operated application. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 OUTLOOK: The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
