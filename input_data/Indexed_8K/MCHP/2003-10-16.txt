CHANDLER, Arizona  October 16, 2003  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2003.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $168.5 million, up 4.5% sequentially from $161.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 1% from sales of $166.8 million in the prior year's second quarter.  Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $36.1 million or 17 cents per diluted share, up 7.8% from pro forma net income of $33.5 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 5.0% from pro forma net income of $34.4 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the prior year's second quarter.  GAAP net income of $36.1 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, was up 168% sequentially from GAAP net income of $13.5 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and up 280% from GAAP net income of $9.5 million, or 5 cents per diluted share in the same quarter a year ago.  A reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
The Company expects to declare a quarterly cash dividend within the next week.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and increased the cash dividend amount in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003.
 
"Sales and EPS were both at the high end of our expectations for the September quarter, sales in Asia and the Americas both exhibited excellent sequential growth, while Europe's performance reflected the anticipated summer holidays in that region," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.
 
"Sales of memory products were up over 12% sequentially, reflecting strong market conditions for those products.  We are seeing leadtimes on serial EEPROMs stretch out from certain competitors.  After nearly three years of very aggressive pricing pressure in the serial EEPROM market, we are selectively raising prices.  Analog sales grew by 6% sequentially, driven by our attach strategy with microcontrollers, and sales of microcontrollers grew approximately 3% sequentially in the quarter," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
"We continued to have strong cash generation in the quarter of approximately $78 million, and inventory fell by $4.5 million, with inventory days at 123, a drop of 11 days from the June quarter.  By the end of the December quarter, we expect inventory days to further improve and to be at the high end of our inventory target, at approximately 110 days.  This improved inventory position is expected to occur one quarter sooner than we previously planned," said Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon was qualified for production during the quarter, and is scheduled to begin production on October 31, 2003.  With our improved inventory position, we are planning to accelerate the Fab 4 ramp," said Mr. David Lambert, Microchip's Vice President of Fab Operations.
 
"Our book to bill ratio as of September was 1.04, and we are continuing to see strong demand characteristics in all areas of our business.  We are seeing an increase in activity of demand pull ins and requests to expedite from our customers and distributors because of very low inventory in the channel.  We have put the Company into upcycle dynamics and are prepared to meet the incremental demand of customers as well as distributor inventory rebuild.  We expect revenue growth in the current quarter of between 5 and 6 percent sequentially, in an otherwise seasonally weak quarter for Microchip," Mr. Sanghi concluded.
