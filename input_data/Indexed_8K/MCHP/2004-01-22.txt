This information is being furnished pursuant to Item 12   as provided in SEC Release No. 34-47226.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 22, 2004, we announced the results of our operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2003.  The complete release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The attached press release includes information regarding certain of our historical results on a pro forma basis (a non-GAAP financial measure).  To supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP additional measures of operating results, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses in order to enhance the overall understanding of our past financial performance and also the prospects for our future. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our performance. For example, the non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operational results. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for reviewing our financial results, budget planning and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Reports Third Quarter
Fiscal Year 2004 Results
 
"Our business continued to strengthen during the quarter, achieving 5.6% net sales growth in a period that seasonally slows at the end of December in both the Americas and Europe.  This was the best December quarter sequential revenue growth the company achieved since December 1999.  Operating profits during the quarter were over 30%, and we generated $100 million in free cash, a record for Microchip.  We achieved record net sales of over $141 million in Microcontrollers, and also grew both the Memory and Analog product areas," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Visibility in all sectors of our business improved.  Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.26 overall, and was 1.10 in our direct business, resulting in the highest backlog we have seen since January 2001."
 
"Days of inventory declined from 123 days in September to 108 days in December.  We expect to continue to reduce our days of inventory over the next several quarters, as we indicated earlier," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory at our distributors grew for the first time in many quarters, but still remained at relatively low levels of approximately 2.2 months.  The majority of this growth was at our international distributors.  Many of our peers operate on a sell-in revenue recognition basis for these distributors.  If Microchip had reflected sales on this basis, our net sales would have grown by approximately an additional 4% over our reported results."
 
"Fab 4 in Gresham began production in late October as we had previously advised," said Mr. David Lambert, Microchip's Vice President of Fab Operations.  "I am extremely pleased with the performance of our facility during the December quarter.  The team has executed flawlessly, and productivity and yields have exceeded our initial expectations."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "As we look to the current quarter, our visibility has certainly improved, driven by the excellent book-to-bill ratio I mentioned earlier.  However, the March quarter has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter, influenced by the Lunar/Chinese New Year.  Asia is our largest geography, and the seasonal influence is an important consideration based on our business in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.  The Americas and Europe regions have historically been the stronger geographies in our March quarters, as they have fewer holidays impacting their business.  However, all geographies will be impacted by the Christmas build from the December quarter.  Taking all of these factors into consideration, we expect revenues to grow in the March quarter by 1 to 4% compared to the December quarter.  EPS for the March quarter is expected to be between 19 and 20 cents," Mr. Sanghi concluded.
