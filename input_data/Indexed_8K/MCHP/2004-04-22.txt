Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $191.5 million, up 7.6% sequentially from $178.0 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 20.0% from sales of $159.7 million in the prior year's fourth quarter.  GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was a record $46.8 million or 22 cents per diluted share, up 16.0% from pro forma net income of $40.4 million or 19 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter; up 14.7% from GAAP net income of $40.8 million or 19 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 41.8% from GAAP net income of $33.0 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the prior year's fourth quarter.
 
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 were $699.3 million, an increase of 7.3% from net sales of $651.5 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a pro forma basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was $156.8 million, or 74 cents per diluted share, an increase of 17.2% from net income of $133.9 million, or 64 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was $137.3 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, an increase of 55.6% from net income of $88.2 million, or 42 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  Pro forma diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2004 exclude the effects of accelerated depreciation and other related charges associated with the closure of Fab 1 in Chandler, Arizona.  A reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on its common stock, increasing the dividend by 14.3%.  The cash dividend is payable on June 4, 2004 to stockholders of record on May 13, 2004.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased the cash dividend by 100% since the initial declaration.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional 2.5 million shares of its Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The Board of Directors previously authorized on August 7, 2002 a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 millions shares and on March 11, 2004, authorized an additional stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares of its Common Stock.  Microchip has been buying stock in the open market since that date.  Approximately 2.3 million shares were repurchased in the March quarter at a cost of approximately $61 million.  Prior to the additional 2.5 million share authorization announced today, as of April 21, 2004 approximately 847,000 shares remained available for purchase.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
 
"Net sales and EPS both exceeded the high end of our expectations for the March quarter.  During the quarter, sales of microcontroller products were up 7.8% sequentially, driven by our leadership position in Flash microcontrollers.  About half of our microcontroller products in production at Microchip are now Flash-based microcontrollers, and we provide Flash-based microcontroller solutions for the broad requirements of our customers," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "For the last three years, all of the Company's new microcontroller product development has been in Flash-based microcontrollers, and almost all of our microcontroller revenue growth is coming from Flash-based microcontrollers."
Mr. Sanghi continued, "We are seeing strong design win activity, and the current booking rate is spectacular.  Our customer base continues to expand in new markets and applications, and we are now serving over 43,000 customers worldwide.  During the quarter, we shipped 11,380 new development systems, with a record 43,006 development systems shipped in fiscal year 2004.  This exceeds our previous record set in fiscal 2003 by 22%."
 
"Analog sales in the fourth quarter were up 8.1% sequentially, reaching a record level since the acquisition of TelCom Semiconductor three years ago.  Our customer base for analog products continues to expand, and has grown from 2,857 customers in early 2001 to 8,935 customers today.  We added another 444 analog customers in the March 2004 quarter," said Mr. Richard Simoncic, Vice President, Analog and Interface Products Division.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "We continued to have strong cash generation in the quarter of approximately $75 million.  During the quarter, we bought back approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.61 per share.  We ended the quarter with $475 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory fell by $1.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter, with inventory days dropping from 108 days at the end of December to 101 days at the end of March, in line with the guidance we previously provided.  We expect inventory days to further improve to 96 - 98 days by the end of the June quarter," Mr. Parnell added.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon executed superbly in its second quarter of production.  Fab 4 has increased output five times already since its start up in October 2003.  Fab 4 is currently on a steep ramp and is executing nearly flawlessly," said Mr. David Lambert, Vice President of Fab Operations.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our bookings in the quarter were an all-time record, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.28.  We are seeing strong demand characteristics in all areas of our business.  We started the June quarter with 67% of the quarter in backlog, which has filled to 84% during the first three weeks of April.  We currently expect our net sales in the June quarter will grow by 7% to 8% sequentially, and EPS is expected to be about 25 cents."
Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2004 Highlights:
 
Microchip announced the shipment of its three billionth PIC microcontroller to American Power Conversion (APC). The three-billionth unit was the PIC18F452 8-bit Flash microcontroller, which uses Microchip's latest architecture and proprietary high-reliability PMOS Electrically Erasable Cell (PEEC) Flash technology.  Microchip delivered its one-billionth microcontroller in the fall of 1999 after 10 years of operation, the two-billionth shipment occurred fewer than 30 months later in the spring of 2002, and now the three-billionth shipment has been achieved in less than two years  establishing a strong pattern of growth.  These milestones demonstrate the industry's continued acceptance of Microchip's PIC microcontrollers as the high-performance, cost-effective solution for embedded control designs.
 - 
                 
 
The Company reached another significant milestone by delivering its 300,000th development system during the quarter.  Few semiconductor companies can match Microchip in the total number of tools installed in the field.  The MPLAB In Circuit Debugger (ICD) 2 achieved strong sales growth during the fourth quarter.  Total cumulative development system shipments now stand at 305,000.
