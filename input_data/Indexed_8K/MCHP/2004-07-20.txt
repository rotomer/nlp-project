On July 20, 2004, we announced the results of our operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.  The complete release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The attached press release includes information regarding certain of our historical results on a pro forma basis (a non-GAAP financial measure).  To supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP additional measures of operating results, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses in order to enhance the overall understanding of our past financial performance and also the prospects for our future. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our performance. For example, the non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operational results.  In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for reviewing our financial results, budget planning and for planning and forecasting of future periods.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

CHANDLER, Arizona  July 20, 2004  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2004.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $212.8 million, up 11.1% sequentially from $191.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 31.9% from sales of $161.3 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was a record $56.8 million or 27 cents per diluted share, up 21.2% from GAAP net income of $46.8 million or 22 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 321.5% from GAAP net income of $13.5 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter; and up 69.5% from pro forma net income of $33.5 million or 16 cents per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter.  Pro forma diluted earnings per share for the prior year's first quarter exclude the effects of accelerated depreciation and other related charges associated with the closure of Fab 1 in Chandler, Arizona.  A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.046 per share on its common stock, increasing the dividend by 15%.  The cash dividend is payable on September 1, 2004 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2004.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased the cash dividend by 130% since the initial declaration.
 
"This was the best quarter for Microchip in its entire history.  In the quarter ended June 30, 2004 we achieved record net sales, record gross margin percentage, record operating profit percentage and record earnings per share," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "For about a year or so, we have been guiding investors and analysts towards a business model of 57% to 58% gross margin and 33% to 34% operating profit by the end of fiscal year 2005.  I am very pleased to have delivered these results three quarters ahead of schedule."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Net sales and EPS both exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.  During the quarter, sales of all product lines showed significant sequential increases.  Microcontroller sales achieved another record and were up 9.3% sequentially, driven by our continuing leadership position in Flash microcontrollers.  Analog sales were up a very solid 15.5% sequentially, reaching a record level since the acquisition of TelCom Semiconductor three-and-a-half years ago.  Serial EEPROM memory products were up approximately 20% sequentially, reflecting healthy market conditions."
 
"We have a very strong new product introduction and design cycle underway.  With our recent announcement of the world's smallest microcontroller in a 6-pin package, the release of about 50 new Flash microcontrollers in the last year, the release of eight new dsPIC products and about 23 new analog products, we are seeing very robust design win activity.  We are continuing to find a large number of new opportunities in the 8-bit microcontroller market.  In addition, we have expanded our served available market with the dsPIC digital signal controllers in the 16-bit microcontroller space.  Our customer base continues to expand in new markets and applications, and we are now serving over 43,000 end customers worldwide.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, we shipped 14,624 new development systems, another all time record, demonstrating the continued strong acceptance of our products.  The total number of development systems shipped now stands at 319,624," Mr. Sanghi continued.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to have strong free cash generation of approximately $87.1 million in the first fiscal quarter.  During the quarter, we bought back 852,900 shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.76 per share.  We ended the quarter with $538.9 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory fell by $3.9 million in the first fiscal quarter, with inventory days dropping from 101 days at the end of March to 91 days at the end of June, lower than the guidance we previously provided, driven by the improved revenue performance for the quarter.  We have now achieved our target model for days of inventory," Mr. Parnell added.
 
"Our Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon, executed superbly in the quarter ended June 30, its third quarter of production.  Fab 4 has increased wafer starts several times now and at the current production rate, the wafer cost of Fab 4, based on comparable technologies has already matched that of our fully utilized Fab 2, and we anticipate further improvements going forward," said Mr. David Lambert, Vice President of Fab Operations.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our bookings in the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 continued at a strong pace, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.07.  The September quarter backlog was 7.7% higher at the start of the quarter than that of the June quarter.  We started the September quarter with 68% of the quarter in backlog.  We currently expect that our net sales in the quarter ending September 30, 2004 will grow by approximately 5% sequentially, and EPS is expected to be about 29 cents."
