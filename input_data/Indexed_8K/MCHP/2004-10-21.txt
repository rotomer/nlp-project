CHANDLER, Arizona  October 21, 2004  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $220.7 million, up 31% from sales of $168.5 million in the prior year's second quarter, and up 3.7% sequentially from $212.8 million in the immediately preceding quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was a record $60.4 million or 29 cents per diluted share, up 67.4% from GAAP net income of $36.1 million or 17 cents per diluted share in the prior year's second quarter; up 6.5% from pro forma net income of $56.8 million or 27 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 38.1% from GAAP net income of $43.8 million or 21 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. Pro forma diluted earnings per share for the immediately preceding quarter excludes the effects of a special charge related to the settlement of patent license litigation. A reconciliation of GAAP to pro forma earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.052 per share on its common stock, increasing the dividend by 13%. The cash dividend is payable on December 1, 2004 to stockholders of record on November 15, 2004. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased the cash dividend by 160% since the initial declaration.
 
"I am particularly proud of our solid execution in the September quarter, in the face of very difficult conditions in the overall semiconductor industry during the quarter. We met our operating margin and earnings per share guidance and achieved sequential net sales growth of approximately 4%," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "These accomplishments reflect well on our overall business strength, given many companies in the semiconductor industry reported revenue that was sequentially down, and many companies also missed their original revenue guidance substantially."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Microcontroller sales achieved new record levels and were up sequentially by approximately 6%, while both analog and memory sales were sequentially lower. Our strength in Flash microcontrollers, the market drive to programmable solutions and numerous new, emerging applications continue to expand our penetration in the overall 8-bit market."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our free cash flow in the September quarter was $67 million net of a settlement of $21.1 million related to patent license litigation. We continued to be active in our stock buy-back program, executing a buy-back of 1,682,600 shares at an average price of $26.30 during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $606 million in cash and short-term investments."
 
"Our inventory continued to fall during the September quarter. Inventory days were 87 days as of the end of September, compared to 91 days at the end of the preceding quarter," Mr. Parnell added. "When we combine total inventory on our balance sheet and at our distributors worldwide, total inventory supporting our customer base was essentially flat at September 30, 2004, compared to the preceding quarter."
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Similar to many other companies in the industry, we saw weakness in our bookings in the September quarter, and we started the December quarter with 55% of the quarter in backlog. Taking into account the current industry conditions, we expect net sales and net income in the December quarter to be flat with the September period."
