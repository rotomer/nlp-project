CHANDLER, Arizona  April 27, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and the three months ended March 31, 2005.  Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were $846.9 million, an increase of 21.1% from net sales of $699.3 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $213.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, an increase of 55.8% from net income of $137.3 million, or 65 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was $226.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, an increase of 44.6% from net income of $156.8 million, or 74 cents per diluted share in the prior year.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 exclude special charges related to the settlement of patent license litigation and costs associated with the closure of Fab 1, respectively.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $208.1 million, up 1.3% sequentially from sales of $205.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 8.7% from sales of $191.5 million in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.  GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $56.4 million or 27 cents per diluted share, up 6.1% from GAAP net income of $53.1 million or 25 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 20.4% from GAAP net income of $46.8 million or 22 cents per diluted share in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.095 per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 3, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 13, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
 
"Establishing record levels in fiscal 2005 in many key areas of our enterprise continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Record levels in net sales, gross and operating margins and net income reflect our strong market position."
 
"We also returned to a pattern of sequential revenue growth in the March 2005 quarter after only one quarter of inventory correction, with growth of 1.3%.  We have also focused on cost improvements in our business, resulting in record gross margins of 57.4% and EPS of 27 cents for the March quarter," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days at the end of March were 107 days.  While up sequentially by 6 days, inventory was at the low end of our expectations.  We fully expect that inventory days will begin to decline in the June quarter, validating our factory utilization and inventory strategy."
 
"Our annual cash flow for fiscal 2005 established new record levels of $328.3 million for Microchip.  With confidence in our future cash flows, we have increased our dividend payment to 9.5 cents, representing a sequential increase of 36%, an annual increase of 138% and a 375% increase since dividend inception," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Based on our assessment of our business and the overall economic environment, we anticipate sequential net sales growth of about 5% in the June quarter.  With our book-to-bill ratio reaching approximately parity in the March 2005 quarter and continuing strong customer demand in April to date, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve a solid growth quarter.  Based on our expectations, EPS will be about 28 cents."
 
Microchip's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2005 Highlights:
 
 - 
                 
Microchip shipped 15,706 new development systems in the quarter and 53,311 during fiscal year 2005.  Both are record numbers, demonstrating the continued strong interest in our products.  The total cumulative number of development systems shipped now stands at 358,311.

Microchip announced four new high pin count, high-density members of the PIC18F microcontroller family, offering the most cost-effective 96 and 128 Kbytes of self-reprogrammable, high-endurance Flash memory with up to 10 MIPS performance over a wide operating voltage range of 2.0 to 5.5V.  These features, combined with nanoWatt Technology power management and a rich set of analog and digital peripherals, allow this microcontroller series to compete with 16-bit devices in high-end embedded applications while retaining ease of use and helping designers to preserve their 8-bit development tool and software investments.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip introduced the PIC16F785 8-bit Flash microcontroller which provides a complete set of integrated peripherals for cost-effective digital control in power-conversion designs.  This device has a large complement of onboard analog peripherals, including A/D converters, comparators, a voltage reference and two operational amplifiers, which also appeals to a broad range of sensing and closed-loop control applications.
 
 - 
                 
Four new 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers (DSCs) began volume production, offering designers performance speeds of 20 and 30 million instructions per second, self-programming capabilities via Flash memory, and industrial and extended temperature ranges.  The dsPIC30F3014 and dsPIC30F4013 extend the package and memory range of the General Purpose Family, adding 24 and 48 Kbytes of Flash program memory respectively, in a package as small as an 8x8 millimeter QFN.  In the Motor Control and Power Conversion Family, the dsPIC30F3010 and dsPIC30F3011 feature 24 Kbytes of Flash program memory and can operate at full speed using an internal oscillator.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip launched five software libraries for its 16-bit dsPIC DSCs, making it easy for engineers to add new functionality to their designs.  The Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Noise Suppression Libraries for dsPIC DSC-based speaker and microphone applications provide a cost-effective, easy way to improve sound quality and intelligibility.  The Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption Libraries for secure embedded transaction communications cost effectively reduce the risk of unwanted data manipulation or interpretation with single dsPIC DSCs.  The Speech Recognition Library provides engineers with a way to use one dsPIC DSC for both controlling an application and recognizing speech commands, eliminating the need for a dedicated speech IC.

Microchip expanded its thermal management solutions with the proprietary MCP9700/MCP9701 temperature sensors.  These devices offer a small SC-70 package, low power of 6 microamp current consumption (typical) and low cost of 30 cents each in thousand-unit quantities, creating an attractive alternative to using thermistors.  They provide a complete, easy-to-use solution for hundreds of embedded applications that require thermal protection, temperature measurement or thermal calibration.
 
First Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook:
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are currently anticipated to be approximately $218 million, up approximately 5% from the March 2005 quarter.
 
 - 
                 
Gross margins for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 57.5%.  Generally, gross margins fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions.
 
 - 
                 
Operating expenses for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 25%.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue, foreign currency effects on our business, and profit levels.
 
 - 
                 
The tax rate for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 
 - 
                 
Earnings per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 28 cents.
 
 - 
                 
Inventories at June 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 100 to 104 days.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 
 - 
                 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending June 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately $15 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2006 are expected to total approximately $55 to $60 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 
 - 
                 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect to add approximately $80 million to our existing cash balances during the quarter ending June 30, 2005.  This amount is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 
 - 
                 
Microchip announced on March 11, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares, and on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized an additional stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.  At March 31, 2005, approximately 1.6 million shares remained available for purchase under these programs.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management.  Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making.  The non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors allows them to focus on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.  This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States.  It excludes items such as restructurings and special charges, that may have a material effect on the Company's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations.  We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.
