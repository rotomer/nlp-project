CHANDLER, Arizona  July 26, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2005.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $218.5 million, up 5.0% sequentially from $208.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 2.7% from sales of $212.8 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $61.0 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, up 8.2% from GAAP net income of $56.4 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; up 39.3% from GAAP net income of $43.8 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter; and up 7.5% from non-GAAP net income of $56.8 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the prior year's first quarter exclude special charges related to the settlement of patent license litigation.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is included as part of this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 12.5 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on August 12, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
"All product segments grew sequentially in the June quarter, with microcontrollers leading the way with 5.3% sequential sales growth," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Our overall sequential net sales growth of 5.0% in the June quarter compared very favorably with many of our peers and competitors in the semiconductor industry."
 
"The combination of our proprietary product positioning, where pricing is more stable than other areas of the semiconductor industry, richer product mix, and record manufacturing yields and efficiency resulted in record gross margins of 58.3% in the June quarter.  Our achievement of record net income of $61.0 million further reflects our sound business strategies," Mr. Sanghi continued.
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days at the end of June were 104 days, down from 107 days at the end of the prior quarter ended March 31, 2005.  Clearly our reduction in inventory days and our improving gross margin trends validate our factory utilization and inventory strategy."
 
"Net cash generated for the June quarter met our expectations at $100.2 million for the period before the payment of $19.8 million in dividends.  We continue to return incremental value to our shareholders through an increased dividend payment, declaring a dividend payment of 12.5 cents per share, a sequential increase of approximately 32%," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter was above parity at 1.07.  While we are pleased with the overall positioning of our business entering the September quarter, we are mindful of the seasonal effects of vacation shutdowns in several regions of Europe during this quarter.  Based on our overall assessment of the business we anticipate sequential net sales growth in the September quarter of about 4% and EPS in the September quarter of approximately 30 cents."

Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 Outlook:
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005 are currently anticipated to be approximately $227 million, up approximately 4% from the June 2005 quarter.
 
Gross margins for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 58.75%.  Generally, gross margins fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately 25.0%.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue, foreign currency effects on our business, and profit levels
 - 
                 
.
 
The tax rate for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 - 
                 
 
Earnings per diluted share for the second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 30 cents.
 - 
                 
 
Inventories at September 30, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately flat in number of days with the June quarter.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 - 
                 
 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending September 30, 2005 are expected to be approximately $15 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are expected to total approximately $55 to $60 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect net cash generation during the September quarter of approximately $106 million before the dividend payment of $26 million announced today.  This amount is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 - 
                 
 
Microchip announced on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.  At June 30, 2005, approximately 1.6 million shares remained available for purchase under this program.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
