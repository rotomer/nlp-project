CHANDLER, Arizona  October 20, 2005  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2005.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were a record $227.3 million, up 4.0% sequentially from $218.5 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 3.0% from sales of $220.7 million in the prior year's second quarter.  GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, up 7.6% from GAAP net income of $61.0 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 8.6% from GAAP net income of $60.4 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 16 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on November 18, 2005 to stockholders of record on November 3, 2005.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"All product segments grew sequentially in the September 2005 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall, as well as record microcontroller sales," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Asia was our fastest growing geography during September, achieving record sales levels of $101 million, representing over 44% of our overall business."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "Record gross and operating margins of 59.2% and 34.9% respectively in the September quarter reflect our proprietary business model, enabling Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $65.7 million for the period.
 
"We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 28% sequentially to a record 16 cents per share," Mr. Sanghi added.  "We already had the highest dividend rate in the semiconductor industry.  With this increase, we now have a dividend rate similar to the average dividend rate of the companies in the S&P 500.  We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning value to our shareholders."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of September were at 108 days, up four days from inventory levels at June 30, 2005.  Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of September was lower than inventory levels at the end of June, resulting in the overall inventory supporting our business being essentially flat from June to September."
 
"We generated net cash for the September period of $113.7 million, before the payment of $26.2 million in dividends," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "While our overall book-to-bill ratio was at parity for the September quarter, our direct customers' book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 and our distribution channel book-to-bill was below parity, reflecting the tight asset management in that channel.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the December quarter to be approximately $234 million, sequential growth of 3%, and EPS of approximately 32 cents."
 
 
Microchip's Recent Highlights:
 
Microchip significantly expanded its presence in the growing $4 billion 16-bit microcontroller market space with the recent announcement of 49 new 16-bit PIC microcontrollers and dsPIC digital signal controllers.

Operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are expected to be approximately 24.5% of net sales.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue, foreign currency effects on our business, and profit levels
 - 
                 
.
 
The tax rate for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 - 
                 
Earnings per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately 32 cents.
 - 
                 
 
Inventories at December 31, 2005 are anticipated to be approximately flat in number of days with the September quarter.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 - 
                 
 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2005 are expected to be approximately $20 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are expected to total approximately $60 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect net cash generation during the December quarter of approximately $100 million before the dividend payment of approximately $34 million announced today.  The amount of expected cash generation is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 - 
                 
 
Microchip announced on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.  At September 30, 2005, approximately 1.6 million shares remained available for purchase under this program.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.
