INCREASED DIVIDEND BY 18.8% SEQUENTIALLY, TO A RECORD 19 CENTS PER SHARE
 
CHANDLER, Arizona  January 19, 2006   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2005.  Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were a record $234.9 million, up 3.3% sequentially from $227.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 14.4% from sales of $205.4 million in the prior year's third quarter.  GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was a record $70.7 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, up 7.7% from GAAP net income of $65.7 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter; and up 33.1% from GAAP net income of $53.1 million, or 25 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's third quarter.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 19 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on February 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on February 2, 2006.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"Revenue from both our microcontroller and analog products grew sequentially and reached record levels in the December 2005 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO.  "Analog products delivered exceptional performance, with revenue growing approximately 18% sequentially, and approximately 40% over the year ago quarter."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "From a geographic perspective, Asia was again our fastest growing geography during the December quarter, achieving record sales levels of $108.6 million, representing over 46% of our overall business.  A growing portion of our Asian business continues to come from customer design activities in the Americas and Europe."
 
"We also achieved record gross and operating margins of 59.7%, and 36.0%, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, further reflecting our proprietary business model," Mr. Sanghi added.  "The record net sales as well as operating margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $70.7 million for the period."
 
"We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 18.8% sequentially to a record 19 cents per share," Mr. Sanghi added.  "We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning increasing value to our shareholders."
 
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of December were at 111 days, up three days from inventory levels at September 30, 2005.  Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of December was essentially the same as levels at the end of September."
 
"We generated record net cash for the December quarter of $126 million, before the payment of $34 million in dividends and $3 million in stock buyback activity," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "We achieved record new bookings in the December quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.04.  Our starting backlog in the March quarter is higher than what we experienced in the December quarter, although March is normally a seasonally weak quarter for Microchip.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the quarter ending March 31, 2006 to be approximately $242 million, providing sequential growth of 3%.  Earnings per share are expected to be 34 cents."

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2006 Outlook:
 
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 are currently anticipated to be approximately $242 million, up approximately 3% from the December 2005 quarter.
 
Gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 are expected to be approximately 59.75% to 60%.  Generally, gross margins fluctuate over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, analog products and memory products sold; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions.
 - 
                 
 
Operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 are expected to be approximately 23.5% to 24% of net sales.  Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and profit levels
 - 
                 
.
 
The tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 - 
                 
 
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 are anticipated to be approximately 34 cents.
 - 
                 
 
Inventories at March 31, 2006 are anticipated to be approximately flat in number of days with the December 2005 quarter.  The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 - 
                 
 
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2006 are expected to be approximately $20 million, and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2006 are expected to total approximately $65 million.  The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.
 - 
                 
Based on cash projected to be generated from operations and current projected capital expenditure levels, we expect net cash generation during the March quarter of approximately $110 million before the dividend payment of approximately $40 million announced today.  The amount of expected cash generation is before the effect of any stock buy-back activity.
 - 
                 
 
Microchip announced on April 22, 2004 that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock buy-back of up to 2.5 million shares.  At December 31, 2005, approximately 1.5 million shares remained available for purchase under this program.  Future purchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management.  Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making.  The non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors to focus on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.  This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States.  It excludes items such as special charges, which may have a material effect on the Company's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations.  We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS
