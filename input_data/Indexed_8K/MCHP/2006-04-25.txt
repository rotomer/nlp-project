immediately
preceding quarter was $40.1 million. Non-GAAP results exclude a tax charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were $927.9 million, an increase of 9.6% from net sales of $846.9 million in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was $242.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, an increase of 13.4% from net income of $213.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was $273 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, an increase of 20.4% from net income of $226.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 exclude a tax charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and a special charge related to the settlement of patent license litigation, respectively. A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
 
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 21.5 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 23, 2006 to stockholders of record on May 9, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
"We are very pleased to have delivered another record quarter in nearly every respect. Both our microcontroller and analog product revenues grew sequentially to record levels in the March 2006 quarter, allowing Microchip to achieve record net sales levels overall," said Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO. "While our overall microcontroller revenue grew 4.9% sequentially and 17.8% from the year ago quarter, our Flash microcontrollers were up a strong 9.6% sequentially and up 42% compared to the same quarter last fiscal year."
 
Mr. Sanghi stated, "Our 16-bit microcontroller revenue exhibited very strong sequential revenue growth, increasing by approximately 46% to a new record, albeit from a small base. Microchip's analog product revenue also delivered robust performance, growing approximately 17% sequentially, and 52% over the year ago quarter. In addition to continued healthy expansion in our core 8-bit microcontroller business, Microchip is gaining a strong foothold in these two very important and strategic market segments."

"Development systems continued to be shipped at a brisk pace during fiscal 2006, demonstrating strong customer demand for our products," said Ganesh Moorthy, Vice President, Advanced Microcontroller and Memory Division. "During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and for the fiscal year 2006 we shipped a record 19,991 and 73,705 systems, respectively."
 
"Our continued strong performance is also a tribute to several initiatives over the last two years, where Microchip has taken increasingly higher levels of direct control of demand creation on our products," Mr. Sanghi continued. "While the fulfillment of orders continues to be through distributors, Microchip has added significantly to direct sales, applications and training resources to accelerate design-in activity for our products. We are definitely pleased with the results."
 
Mr. Sanghi said, "From a geographic perspective, Europe led this quarter's growth with net sales up approximately 18% sequentially. The Americas delivered net sales growth of approximately 9% sequentially, while Asia net sales were lower by approximately 4%, reflecting the seasonal factors in that geography related to the Lunar New Year holidays.
 
"We achieved record gross and operating margins of 60.1% and 36.2% respectively in the March 2006 quarter, further evidencing our proprietary business model," Mr. Sanghi added. "The record net sales as well as operating margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record GAAP net income of $75.6 million for the period."
 
Mr. Sanghi continued, "We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 13.2% sequentially, to a record 21.5 cents per share. We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning additional value to our shareholders."
 
"On a full fiscal year basis, we achieved record net sales in microcontrollers, analog products, gross margin percentage, operating margin percentage, earnings per share, net cash generation, and dividend payments," Mr. Sanghi added.

Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer said, "Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of March were at 106 days, down 5 days from inventory levels at December 31, 2005. Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of March was 2.0 months, which is in the same range as it was at the end of December."
 
"We generated net cash for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $110 million, before the payment of $40.5 million in dividends. For fiscal 2006, we generated net cash flow of approximately $450 million, before dividend payments of $120 million and stock buyback activity of $3 million," Mr. Parnell added.
 
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "We achieved record bookings in the March quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Our starting backlog in the June quarter is higher than the levels entering the March quarter. Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the June 2006 quarter to be up 5% to 6% sequentially. Earnings per share are expected to be about 37 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of all stock-based compensation expense. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 35 cents."

 - 
                 
 
Operating expenses for the quarter ending June 30, 2006 are expected to be approximately 24.0% of net sales, prior to the effects of all stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and profit levels
 - 
                 
.
 
The tax rate for the quarter ending June 30, 2006 is anticipated to be approximately 24%.
 - 
                 
 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter ending June 30, 2006 are anticipated to be approximately 35 cents on a GAAP basis, excluding the effect of all stock-based compensation expense, and about 37 cents on a non-GAAP basis.
 - 
                 
 
Inventories at June 30, 2006 are anticipated to be approximately 103 days, down approximately three days compared with the March 2006 quarter. The level of inventories fluctuates over time, primarily due to sales volume and overall capacity utilization.
 - 
                 
 
Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 are expected to total approximately $80 million. The level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core financial performance. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures enterprise performance using non-GAAP financial measures such as those that are disclosed in this press release. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical core operating results and comparisons to competitors' core operating results as determined by management. Management believes that non-GAAP information allows for additional transparency and such information is used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures that management determines as being informative to investors focuses on the ongoing operations and the core results of our business. In the past, we have reported non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The historical non-GAAP information in this press release excludes items such as a special charge for a litigation settlement and a tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which may have a material effect on our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the
Microchip Technology
Reports Fourth Quarter and
Fiscal Year 2006 Results
 
when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations. In addition, in this press release we have provided EPS guidance on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). This non-GAAP financial measure excludes the income statement effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. We plan to report our future results on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis to exclude such 123R effects and will include a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our future announcements. We are disclosing this non-GAAP information to the public to enable investors to more easily assess our performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with other companies that separately identify share-based compensation expenses. In particular, as we begin to apply 123R, we believe it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of 123R are being reflected on our income statements.
