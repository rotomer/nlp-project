CHANDLER, Arizona - July 20, 2006 - (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were $262.6 million, up 6.2% sequentially from $247.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 20.2% from sales of $218.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 23.5 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on August 17, 2006 to stockholders of record on August 3, 2006. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
We are very pleased to have delivered yet another record quarter in nearly every respect. Net sales exceeded the one billion dollar run rate for the first time in our history, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO. Net sales also exceeded the high end of our guidance. The revenue growth was driven by our microcontroller business which grew a robust 8.2% sequentially and was up 21.0% over the year ago quarter. Our Flash microcontroller business was even stronger and grew 12.1% sequentially and over 46% from the year ago quarter.
We also achieved another record quarter in development system shipments. We shipped a record 20,921 development tools in the quarter, demonstrating continued strong customer interest in our products, said Ganesh Moorthy, Vice President, Advanced Microcontroller and Memory Division.
Mr. Sanghi continued, Our revenue growth was very broad-based, as we grew in all major geographies. Growth was led by Asia which was up 11% sequentially, followed by Europe which grew by 3.8% sequentially, and Americas grew 1.8% sequentially.
Mitch Little, Microchips Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Applications said, Our continued strong performance was directly influenced by several initiatives over the last 3 years, where Microchip has taken an increasingly higher level of direct control of demand creation for our products. Microchip has significantly added to its technical sales, application engineering and customer training resources to accelerate design-in activity for our products. At the same time, we have added several regional distributors and catalog houses. These regional distributors have dedicated significant technical resources applied to creating demand specifically for Microchip. We are definitely pleased with the results. Our success and growth are vindicating this strategy.
We achieved record gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins of 60.4% and 36.4%, respectively, in the June 2006 quarter, Mr. Sanghi added.
Sanghi continued, We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders by 9.3% sequentially, to 23.5 cents per share. We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning additional value to shareholders.

Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory days on our balance sheet at the end of June, prior to the effects of share-based compensation expense, were 101 days, down 5 days from inventory levels at March 31, 2006. Inventory days including the effects of share-based compensation were 102 days. Inventory in the distribution channel at the end of June was 2.0 months, which is at the lower end of the historical range of 1.9 to 3.3 months.
We generated a record net cash flow for the June 2006 quarter of $136.5 million, before the payment of $46.1 million in dividends, Mr. Parnell added.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, With broad-based strength and low inventory in the channels, we expect net sales in the September 2006 quarter to be up about 4% sequentially. With decreasing inventory at Microchip, we are also preparing our factories with equipment and personnel to execute the needed ramp. Earnings per share are expected to be about 39 cents on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation expense. EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be about 37 cents.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.

Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are showing non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes all share-based compensation expense, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods, which we believe is useful to investors. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations. Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending. Our measure of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.
