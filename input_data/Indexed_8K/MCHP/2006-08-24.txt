Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Amendments to 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
On August 18, 2006, the stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved an amendment to the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan) to remove the 30% limitation on the number of shares that can be granted as restricted stock units (RSUs). The amendment was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on May 1, 2006. The purpose of the amendment was to enable the Company to continue to grant RSUs as its primary equity compensation incentive. The Equity Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (which may be granted in the form of restricted stock shares or RSUs), performance shares, performance units, and deferred stock units to Company employees, including executive officers, and consultants as well as for automatic grants of awards to the non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee or its delegates may determine the awards to be made under the Equity Plan, but for the CEO whose awards are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee alone.
On August 18, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors further amended the Equity Plan such that the annual option grants for non-employee directors would be made on the date of the Companys annual stockholders meeting. Prior to the amendment, the grant date for such awards had been the first day of the month in which the annual stockholders meeting was scheduled.
A copy of the Equity Plan, as amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan
On August 18, 2006, the stockholders of the Company approved the Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Executive Plan) to replace the Companys existing Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Management Plan) as it applies to executive officers.
The Executive Plan was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on May 1, 2006.
The Executive Plan will be effective on October 1, 2006 and provides for the payment of cash bonuses to the Companys executive officers based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee after receipt of recommendations from the Companys CEO. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee will determine whether the objectives were met and determine the amount of payout to each participant. The CEO may make recommendations regarding awards to be made, other than those for himself. The purpose of the Executive Plan is to motivate the Companys executive officers to achieve performance objectives and to reward them when those objectives are satisfied.
The performance objectives for each fiscal quarter for fiscal 2007 are based upon the following areas: quarterly sequential sales growth (overall and in the Companys 16-bit and analog product divisions), gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. The quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the Companys CEO and the four other mostly highly paid executive officers participating in the Executive Plan are targeted at an aggregate of approximately $290,000 for all such officers. Because the amount of cash bonuses are dependent upon satisfaction of the performance objectives, the exact amount of the payout (if any) to an executive officer under the program cannot be determined at this time. Actual bonuses may be higher or lower than the targets depending upon the level of performance achieved by the Company. The maximum payment that any participant may receive under the Executive Plan in any Company fiscal year is $2,500,000.
A copy of the Executive Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.
Discretionary Executive Incentive Compensation
On August 18, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the Discretionary Executive Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Discretionary Plan) to replace the discretionary portion of the Companys Management Plan as it applies to executive officers. The Discretionary Plan is intended to increase stockholder value and the success of the Company by providing incentive and reward to executive officers for exceptional performance in

achieving key objectives. Cash bonuses awarded under the Discretionary Plan are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee will determine whether the objectives have been met and determine the amount of payouts (if any) under the Executive Plan. The CEO may make recommendations regarding objectives and awards, other than awards for himself.
Quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the executive officers participating in the Discretionary Plan are dependent upon the satisfaction of objectives and the level of performance achieved by the Company. The exact amount of the payout (if any) to an executive officer under the program cannot be determined at this time. The quarterly payouts for fiscal 2007 will be based upon achievement of specific operational objectives as well as additional factors as the Compensation Committee may determine.
A copy of the Discretionary Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3.
Management Incentive Compensation Plan
Since 1992, the Company has had a management incentive compensation plan for motivating its executive officers, managers and senior technical employees using a formula based upon the Companys financial performance. As described above, on August 18, 2006, the Companys stockholders approved the Executive Plan to replace the Management Plan as it applies to executive officers in order to enhance the Companys ability to obtain tax deductions for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In connection with the approval of the Executive Plan and the Discretionary Plan, the Companys Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Management Plan so that it applies to awards to employees who are not executive officers and to more closely correspond to the applicable provisions of the Executive Plan and the Discretionary Plan. The purpose of the Management Plan is to motivate management and senior technical employees to achieve performance objectives and to reward them for achievement of those objectives. Incentive cash bonuses awarded under the Management Plan are calculated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or their delegates based upon the objectives set by the Compensation Committee. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Compensation Committee or their delegates will determine whether the objectives have been met and determine the amount of payout under the Management Plan. The Management Plan also has a discretionary element to reward exceptional performance.
Quarterly payments in fiscal 2007 for the non-executive employees participating in the Management Plan cannot be determined at this time as they are dependent upon satisfaction of objectives and the level of performance achieved by the Company. Beginning on October 1, 2006, the Companys executive officers will not participate in the Management Plan. The performance objectives for each fiscal quarter for fiscal 2007 are based upon the following areas: quarterly sequential sales growth (overall and in the Companys 16-bit and analog product divisions), gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share, as well as additional objectives as the Compensation Committee may determine.
A copy of the Management Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4.

In no event shall more than 30% of the Shares remaining issuable under the Plan as of the effective date and 30% of the Shares subsequently added to the Plan by virtue of outstanding 1993 Stock Option Plan and 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan options expiring unexercised be issued pursuant to Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit or Deferred Stock Unit Awards with a purchase price lower than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares or units on the date of grant; provided, however, that such 30% limitation shall not apply to Restricted Stock Units issued on or after the date of the Companys 2006 annual stockholders meeting.

(2)
 
check;

Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Option Agreement.
 
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the optioned stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 19 of the Plan.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(g)
 
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participants
misconduct, death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
8
 
(h)
 
Disability
. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement).
