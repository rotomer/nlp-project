This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between ________________ (the Employee) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company), effective as of ________________, 2006 (the Effective Date).
 
 
1.
  
It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
 
2.
  
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
3.
  
The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain benefits upon a Change of Control and certain benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control. These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
 
4.
  
Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 5 below.
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
