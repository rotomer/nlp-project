CHANDLER, Arizona  July 26, 2007   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2007.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $264.1 million, up 2.3% sequentially from sales of $258.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 0.6% from sales of $262.6 million in the prior years first quarter.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  As such, the Company has included additional non-GAAP information in its disclosures to assist shareholders with appropriate comparative information.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $80.3 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, down 37.1% from GAAP net income of $127.7 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.3% from GAAP net income of $77.0 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  The immediately preceding quarter included a tax benefit related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, with an EPS effect of 23 cents.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $86.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, up 6.6% from non-GAAP net income of $81.3 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 6.5% from GAAP

net income of $81.4 million, or 37 cents per share, in the prior years first quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation expense.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 29.5 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on August 23, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2007.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
The results for the June quarter met our revised guidance for the quarter, at a sequential revenue growth of 2.3%, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis achieved record levels of 60.6%.  Earnings per share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis met our revised expectations.
Mr. Sanghi stated, Europe was the weakest area geographically, with revenues down sequentially by 5.4% after the March quarter delivered a 19% sequential increase.  Revenues associated with the U.S. housing market were weaker than we originally expected, as outlined in our press release of June 18, 2007.
Revenues from 16-bit products increased over 24% sequentially in the June quarter, while our design win momentun as well as development tool shipments remained very strong.  Sixteen-bit customers in volume production grew by 22% sequentially, and we had record quarterly shipments of 8,290 development tools," said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Days of inventory on our balance sheet and in the distribution channel both remained essentially flat quarter over quarter.  Cash generation remained very strong for the June period, representing $126.2 million prior to the dividend payment of $61.1 million in the quarter.
Mr. Parnell added, Based on the strong cash flow we are experiencing, we are pleased to increase our cash dividend by 5.4% to 29.5 cents.  This continues to be our principal vehicle to return cash to our shareholders.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% in the September quarter.  EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 36 cents, with EPS on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of share-based compensation, expected to be approximately 39 cents per diluted share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models.
 
We are using non-GAAP profit and gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all of which excludes share-based compensation expense and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in
understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure

our true operating costs.  
Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider share-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, in managing its operations.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of tax events in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the non-recurring nature of these events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
