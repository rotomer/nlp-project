Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2008 Financial Results
 
 
ended March 31, 2008.  Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 were $260.4 million, up 3.1% sequentially from net sales of $252.6 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 0.9% from net sales of $258.2 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $76.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, down 4.3% from GAAP net income of $80.1 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 40.0% from GAAP net income of $127.7 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter.  In December 2007, the Company issued and sold $1.15 billion of its junior convertible debentures.  As a result, the Company had an increase in interest expense, reducing after-tax income by $3.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2008.  Utilizing existing cash balances and the proceeds of the debt transaction, the Company repurchased 32.5 million shares of its common stock during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008.  Consequently, the debt transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduction in diluted common shares outstanding was greater than the increased interest expense.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $79.2 million, down 2.5% from non-GAAP net income of $81.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 2.6% from non-GAAP net income of $81.3 million in the prior years fourth quarter.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record 42 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, compared to 39 cents per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter and 37 cents per diluted share in the prior years fourth quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation and a favorable adjustment related to tax reserves.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 were $1,035.7 million, a decrease of 0.4% from net sales of $1,039.7 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was $297.7 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, a decrease of 16.6% from net income of $357.0 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in the prior year.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was a record $330.4 million or $1.57 per diluted share, an increase of 1.5% from net income of $325.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 excludes a tax benefit related to a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of share-based compensation, and for fiscal year 2008 excludes favorable adjustments related to tax reserves, the sale of Fab 3 and the effect of share-based compensation.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2008 Financial Results
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on May 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on May 12, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
I am very pleased to see our business return to a pattern of revenue growth, and meet the upper end of the earnings per share guidance we provided upon entering the quarter, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  The revenue growth was driven by our proprietary products, where Flash microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and analog all achieved record quarterly revenue.  In addition, gross margins achieved another all-time record, reflecting ongoing operational improvements, depreciation roll-off and firm pricing of our proprietary products.
Geographically, the quarter was in line with our expectations, with revenue in both Europe and Americas growing sequentially, while Asia was down sequentially, impacted by the effects of the Lunar New Year holidays in that region, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Revenues from analog and microcontroller products were both very strong in the March quarter, growing sequentially 8% and 4%, respectively, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Sixteen-bit microcontrollers delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth with sales up 12% sequentially, and up 90% from the year-ago quarter.  Shipments of development tools continued at the strongest level weve seen, achieving record shipments of 33,472 in the March quarter, with worldwide cumulative shipments of 632,785.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, With the strong revenue performance in the quarter, inventory levels at March 31, 2008 declined to 112 days, down 2 days from inventory levels at the end of December 2007.  Inventory in the distribution channel also declined, to 1.8 months of inventory.  Overall, we are pleased with the direction of inventory levels in support of our business.
Mr. Parnell continued, Cash generation continued to be an important element of our business model with cash generation from operations representing $99.3 million in the March quarter and $476.2 million for fiscal year 2008.  Cash generation in the quarter excludes the dividend payment to investors of $60.4 million and stock buy-back activities of $173.3 million.  The Board is reaffirming its commitment to return value to shareholders by the increase in our dividend to 33 cents today, an increase of 17.9% from the dividend level in the same quarter of last year.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, Our book-to-bill ratio in the March quarter was 1.06 and our opening backlog position for the June quarter was up approximately 8% compared to the opening backlog for the March quarter.  However, we continue to watch economic conditions very carefully and monitor the potential impact on our business.  With these factors being considered, we expect sales to be up sequentially 2% to 6% in the June quarter.  EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be 39 to 41 cents and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 43 to 45 cents.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington and the favorable tax events are infrequent events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense, the sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, a tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 related to the resolution of a foreign tax matter, and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 related to adjustments to tax reserves, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of favorable tax events and our sale of Fab 3 in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the infrequent nature of these events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
