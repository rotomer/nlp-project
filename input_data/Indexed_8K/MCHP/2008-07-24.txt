CHANDLER, Arizona  July 24, 2008   (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2008.  Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were a record $268.2 million, up 3.0% sequentially from net sales of $260.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 1.6% from net sales of $264.1 million in the prior years first quarter.  GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 40 cents, essentially flat from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 40 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 11.2% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 36 cents in the prior years first quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was a record 44 cents, up 4.6% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 42 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 12.1% from non-

Fiscal 2009 Results
GAAP earnings per diluted share of 39 cents in the prior years first quarter.  Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.8 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on August 21, 2008 to stockholders of record on August 7, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
I am very proud of the results we achieved despite a very challenging business environment.  Our microcontroller and analog products achieved record net sales levels in the June 2008 quarter.  During the quarter we also achieved net sales growth in all major product lines of Microchip, including record net sales for our 16-bit microcontrollers, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  From a geographic perspective, China was the strongest geography, attaining record net sales levels, with net sales up 18.2% sequentially.  Based on these results, we experienced no measurable adverse impact on our business from the earthquake in China, contrary to the concerns in the market.
Mr. Sanghi continued, We also achieved record non-GAAP gross margins of 61.6% in the June quarter, further evidencing the success of our proprietary business model.  The record net sales as well as gross margin percentage enabled Microchip to achieve record non-GAAP EPS of 44 cents per share for the period.
We are also pleased to be increasing our quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders sequentially to a record 33.8 cents per share, Mr. Sanghi added.  We continue to believe, based on investor feedback, that increasing dividends is a highly desirable way of returning significant value to our shareholders.
All product lines achieved revenue growth during the quarter.  Our microcontroller product revenues grew 3% sequentially to a record level.  Our 16-bit microcontroller revenues grew 5% sequentially and were up 60% over the same period a year ago, also reaching a record level.  Analog product revenues grew 2.5% sequentially and 8.1% over the year ago quarter to a record level.  Our memory revenues also grew 2.7% sequentially, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Shipments of development tools continued at a strong pace, achieving record shipment levels for the third quarter in a row.  We shipped 34,936 development tools in the June quarter, with worldwide cumulative shipments totaling 667,721.

Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Inventory levels continued to decline in the June quarter, with days of inventory now representing 110 days.  Inventory in the distribution channel also declined, representing 32 days of inventory.  Combined inventories declined three days from the March 2008 levels.
Mr. Parnell added, Cash generation continued at a strong level, with cash generation of $118.3 million in the June quarter, prior to the dividend payment and the stock buy back activity.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We achieved record new bookings in the June quarter with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.15, resulting in our starting backlog in the September quarter being higher than what we experienced at the beginning of the June quarter.  However, we continue to be very cautious about the very challenging global business environment including continued weakness in the U.S., the effects of a strong Euro and summer holidays in Europe, and the effects of high energy prices globally.  Based on our assessment of the business, we expect net sales in the quarter ending September 30, 2008 quarter to be flat to up 3% sequentially.  EPS is expected to be approximately 44 to 45 cents on a non-GAAP basis, and EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 40 to 41 cents.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  The favorable tax events are infrequent events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense and a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 related to adjustments to tax reserves, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of favorable tax events in our non-GAAP disclosures are based on the infrequent nature of these events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
