CHANDLER, Arizona  October 23, 2008  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2008.  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were a record $269.7 million, up 0.6% sequentially from net sales of $268.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.3% from net sales of $258.6 million in the prior years second quarter.  GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was 41 cents, up 1.9% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 40 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 48.9% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 27 cents in the prior years second quarter.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on November 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on November 14, 2008.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Despite business conditions being extremely challenging in the September quarter, we were able to grow net sales sequentially to new record levels, with 16-bit microcontrollers and analog products also achieving new record net sales levels, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Geographically, Asia grew approximately 6% sequentially, but net sales in the Americas and Europe regions were both down sequentially.
Mr. Sanghi continued, In the September quarter, we achieved record level non-GAAP gross margins of 61.6%, and non-GAAP operating margins were 35.5%, both indicating the success of our proprietary products.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS in September of 45 cents per share was a record, meeting the high end of our guidance.
Net cash generated in the September quarter was $129.4 million, and for the first half of fiscal 2008 net cash generated was $247.7 million, Mr. Sanghi added.  Our strong cash flow continues to be the cornerstone of our dividend commitment to our shareholders, allowing an increase in the dividend of 9.4% from the level one year ago, to 33.9 cents per share.
We achieved several highlights in our September quarter performance, despite challenging business conditions.  Our 16-bit microcontroller net sales grew 16.8% sequentially and 76.0% year over year, and analog net sales grew 11.7% sequentially and 20.7% year over year, both achieving new record levels.  Our Flash microcontroller net sales also achieved a new record with sequential growth of over 2% and were up 14% year over year, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  Market demand for our development tools continued to be very strong, with shipments achieving record levels for the fourth quarter in a row.  We shipped 35,282 development tools in the September quarter, with cumulative shipments exceeding 700,000.
Mr. Gordon Parnell, Microchips Chief Financial Officer said, Inventory levels were essentially flat as of the end of September relative to the June quarter, representing 110 days.  Inventory in the distribution channel grew modestly to 35 days of inventory as of the end of September.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Global economic conditions are creating significant difficulties in the market, as consumers and businesses deal with liquidity and credit concerns.  Determining demand levels in the current

climate is extremely challenging, as we endeavor to establish customer order patterns based on market conditions.  Based on current business conditions, we will be taking actions in the current quarter relating to expenses and inventory levels including a two-week wafer fab shutdown and reductions in discretionary and variable costs.  We currently expect net sales in the December quarter to be down 8% to 16%.  Diluted EPS is expected to be approximately 31 to 37 cents per share on a GAAP basis, and diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 35 to 41 cents per share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and awards under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate

expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington is a one-time event in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes share-based compensation expense and our sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other special charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider share-based compensation expense when developing and monitoring budgets and spending.  The economic substance behind our decision to exclude share-based compensation relates to these charges being non-cash in nature.  The exclusion of our sale of Fab 3 in our non-GAAP disclosures is based on the one-time nature of this event.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses;
selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
