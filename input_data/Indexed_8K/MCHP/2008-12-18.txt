Executive Severance Agreements
 
On December 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved revised forms of Executive Severance Agreements (the Agreements) for use with the executive officers of the Company.  The revisions (i) make technical changes to the Agreements intended to comply with regulations and guidance under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and (ii) modify the Agreements in a manner intended to ensure that the Company can deduct incentive bonus payments to the executive officers under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Prior to amendment, the Agreements provided that following termination of employment under certain conditions (as described below) within the three-month period preceding or at any time following a Change of Control of the Company (the Change in Control Period), the executive would be eligible to receive a percentage of the executives target bonus for which he was or would have been eligible the year of termination or, if greater, the year of the Change in Control, in a lump-sum.  As amended, in order to ensure compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, the Change in Control Period will end twenty-four months following the Change in Control.
The revised forms of Agreements will be entered into with the following executive officers of the Company:
 
Steve Sanghi President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
 
Stephen V. Drehobl Vice President, Security, Microcontroller and Technology Development Division
 
David S. Lambert Vice President, Fab Operations

Richard J. Simoncic Vice President, Analog and Interface Products Division
 
Copies of the revised forms of Agreements are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the Agreements contained in this Form 8-K is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the exhibits to this filing.
 
The Agreements are not employment contracts and do not specify an employment term, compensation levels or other terms or conditions of employment. The Agreements provide for certain severance benefits to the executive in the event his employment is terminated under specified circumstances, as well as certain benefits upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Agreement).
 
With respect to the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President of Worldwide Sales, if the executives employment terminates for reasons other than Cause (as defined in the Agreement) within the Change of Control Period (as defined in the Agreement), the executive will be entitled to receive severance benefits consisting of the following primary components:

It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.

The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain benefits upon a Change of Control and certain  benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control.

Further, if Employee is a specified employee of the Company (or any successor entity thereto) within the meaning of Section 409A on the date of Employees termination (other than a termination due to death), then the severance payable to Employee, if any, under this Agreement, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together the Deferred Compensation Separation Payments) that are payable within the first six (6) months following Employees termination of employment, shall be delayed until the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the date of the termination, when they shall be paid in full arrears.   All subsequent Deferred Compensation Separation Payments, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Employee dies following his termination but prior to the six (6) month anniversary of his termination, then any Payments delayed in accordance with this paragraph will be payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the date of Employees death and all other Payments will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.

Any amount paid under this Agreement that qualifies as a payment made as a result of an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations that do not exceed the Section 409A Limit shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Payments for purposes of clause (ii) above.

Any taxable reimbursements and/or taxable in-kind benefits provided in this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including: (i)  the amount of any such expense reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided during a taxable year of the Employee shall not affect any expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (ii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made no later than the last day of the employees taxable year that immediately follows the taxable year in which the expense was incurred; and (iii) the right to any such reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit or payment.

The Company and Employee agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to Employee under Section 409A.
