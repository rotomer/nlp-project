CHANDLER, Arizona  January 29, 2009  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller and analog semiconductors, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2008.  Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were $192.2 million, down 28.8% sequentially from net sales of $269.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 23.9% from net sales of $252.6 million in the prior years third quarter.  GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were 40 cents, down 2.3% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 41 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.9% from GAAP earnings per diluted share of 38 cents in the prior years third quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were 23 cents, down 49.5% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 45 cents in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 41.5% from non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 39 cents in the prior years third quarter.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on February 27, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
General economic and semiconductor industry conditions continued to decline during the December quarter, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our December earnings results are reflective of these conditions, and we have taken actions to moderate expense levels and adjust our capacity.  We have instituted pay cuts for all of our employees worldwide, and we are substantially reducing or eliminating discretionary expenses.  We were able to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 by $14 million, or 20%, over the operating expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
We are continuing actions to reduce production levels in our wafer fabrication facilities in the U.S. and our assembly and test facility in Thailand to moderate inventory growth.  We are lowering our production levels by about 40% in the March quarter from peak levels in the September 2008 quarter.  We are charging the underutilization to cost of goods sold to reflect lower than normal production levels.  We are also implementing various other actions to further reduce operating expenses, continued Mr. Sanghi.
We are positioning Microchip to emerge from this economic downturn stronger than our competition by maintaining our focus on product and technology development activities, demand creation initiatives and driving internal efficiencies.  We believe that we will continue to expand our market share in our strategic product lines through our focus on design win opportunities and new product introductions, Mr. Sanghi continued.
Our 16-bit product line revenue was only down 7 percent sequentially and was up 28% from a year ago, which we find encouraging given the depth of the current downturn, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  The number of volume customers in 16-bit continued to grow even in the current environment, and we continue to gain market share and traction in this strategic product line.
Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet grew to 143 days at the end of December compared to 110 days at the end of the September quarter.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors fell by $5.1 million in the December quarter while days of inventory in the
distribution channel increased from 35 days to 41 days.  Despite our actions to reduce our production levels, demand fell so significantly that we were unable to prevent the increase in days of inventory.  We are taking actions that over time should adjust our inventory levels to be more in line with our recent history.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, In light of the unprecedented global economic conditions and limited visibility, Microchip is not providing revenue guidance at this time.  However, for our internal activities, we are planning revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2009 to be approximately $173 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options and restricted stock units under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the price of our common stock.  Our loss on trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of the acquisition of Hampshire Company are non-cash expenses related to such transaction.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington, our favorable settlement with the IRS, the favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS and the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, are one-time events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which exclude a favorable settlement with the IRS, a favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS, the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, a loss on trading securities, the effect of share-based compensation, the impacts of the acquisition of Hampshire Company and our sale of Fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin; research and development expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
