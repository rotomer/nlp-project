Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 4, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
During the March quarter we saw improvement in the overall business environment, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our total backlog bottomed out early in the quarter and then gradually showed modest improvement through the remainder of the quarter.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was 1.04.  We were pleased to end the quarter modestly better than the midpoint of our revenue guidance given on March 10, 2009 and at the high end of our earnings per share guidance.  The earnings per share achievement was driven by excellent control of our operating expenses.  I want to thank all of Microchips employees for the sacrifices they have made, as well as for their overall diligence in driving the reductions in operating expenses.

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2009 Financial Results
In the March quarter, we achieved GAAP gross margins of 48.5% and non-GAAP gross margins of 49.3%, which were slightly lower than our internal plan due to lower utilization levels in our wafer fabrication facilities.  We expect that gross margins bottomed out in the March quarter, and expect improving gross margins in the June quarter.  During the March quarter we ran our wafer fabs at 57% of the peak levels in the September 2008 quarter, which allowed us to reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet to 134 days at March 31, 2009, compared to 143 days at the end of December, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Our 16-bit product line revenue was up 6% sequentially, and was up 21% from a year ago, demonstrating the overall momentum we have in this product line, particularly in this difficult environment, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President.  We are encouraged by the excellent growth we have continued to see in the number of 16-bit volume customers as we continue to gain market share.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $5.0 million in the March quarter compared to the December 2008 quarter.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors fell by $14.5 million in the March quarter, and days of inventory in the distribution channel decreased from 41 days to 38 days.  With inventory days and dollars declining on our balance sheet and at our distributors, we are continuing to make good progress in right-sizing our inventory position.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, With the backdrop of the continued global economic crisis and limited visibility, Microchip is not providing revenue guidance at this time.  However, for our internal activities, we are planning revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2009 to be approximately $182 million, or up about 5% sequentially.

are subject to mark-to-market adjustments.  We have assumed zero gain or loss on such securities for our internal target for GAAP EPS.  Our internal plan for earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis is approximately 16 cents, excluding the effect of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, non-cash interest expense and any mark-to-market adjustment on the value of our trading securities.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP Plan), and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions of Hampshire Company, HI-TECH Software and R&E International are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our sale of Fab 3 in Puyallup, Washington, our favorable settlement with the IRS, the favorable adjustment to tax reserves based on a clarification of tax regulations announced by the IRS, the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, the tax benefit on resolution of a foreign tax matter; the acquisition of a patent portfolio license and our acquisition-related expenses relating to the abandonment of the Atmel transaction are one-time events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
