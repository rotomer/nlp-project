, we received final approval from the state of Oregon and Multnomah County for an eight year extension of our Strategic Investment Program Contract dated as of August 15, 2002 (the SIP) associated with our semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).  The SIP was first effective for us on July 1, 2003, was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2010 and, as a result of the Amendment to the SIP dated , has been extended to June 30, 2018.  Fab 4 consists of an approximately 140-acre campus, buildings totaling approximately 826,500 square feet (including approximately 200,000 square feet of clean room space) and manufacturing equipment.  We use the facility to manufacture semiconductors.

The SIP provides us with a partial property tax exemption on Fab 4.  The SIP exemption requires us to pay property tax on the first $100,000,000.00 of assessed value of Fab 4; the $100,000,000.00 taxable base increases each year by three percent.  To maintain the SIP, we must comply with certain requirements including:
 
  meeting certain minimum employment levels in each of the years covered by the SIP; and
  complying with a first source hiring agreement regarding hiring of employees at Fab 4.

Investment Program
 
Now therefore, in consideration of the following mutual promises, the parties agree as follows:
 
II.           LIMITATIONS ON QUALIFICATION OF PROJECT FOR EXEMPTION; FUTURE EXEMPTIONS.
 
A.           Limitations.
 
The Project consists of the purchase, improvement and equipping of FMIs facilities in Gresham, Oregon.  Only $490 million of assessed value of the Project will be eligible for the exemption, and any assessed value at the Project during the term of this Agreement which exceeds $490 million shall not be eligible for the SIP exemption.  The Project shall receive the SIP exemption for fifteen fiscal years, commencing with County fiscal year 2003-04, and this Agreement and MCHPs SIP partial tax exemption shall terminate on June 30, 2018.
The maximum investments which MCHP expects to make, and the tax years in which those investments will appear on the tax rolls, are estimated to be:

C.           Verification of Factual Assumptions.
 
 
This sum shall be paid to the County within six months following the approval of the Amended SIP Agreement by the Board of County Commissioners.
 
III.           STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OF MCHP.
 
A.           Payment of CSF.
 
1.         Amount.
 
For each year in which MCHP receives the Property Tax Abatement, MCHP shall pay to the County a Community Service Fee (CSF), as provided by ORS 285C.609(4)(b)(B), equal to 25 percent of the property taxes abated in such tax year, but not exceeding $2 million.
 
2.         By November 15.
 
The CSF payment shall be made to the County Finance Manager no later than November 15 of each year, commencing with November 15, 2003.  However, MCHP shall not be required to pay the CSF before ten business days after MCHP receives the invoice described in Section III.A.3, below.  
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 3 of 24
 
Payment shall be made based on an invoice submitted by the County to MCHP in such form and according to such method as shall be agreed to by the parties prior to
November 15 of the tax year in which the Project is assessed and taxed. The payment shall be sent to:
 
 
3.         Statement 30 Days in Advance
 
The County shall provide MCHP with a statement of the CSF due no less than 30 days prior to the due date.
 
4.         Adjustments
 
If the assessed value of the Project is adjusted after November 15 of any tax year in such a manner that property taxes due from MCHP for that year are reduced, and the reduction reduces the CSF for that year, the County shall pay the amount of the reduction to MCHP, together with interest at the rate established by law for tax refunds (ORS 311.505(2)) from the date of payment of the CSF.  If the County does not pay the amount by November 10 of the following year, MCHP may withhold the unpaid amount, plus interest as provided in this Section, from subsequent CSF payments due from MCHP under this Agreement.  If the remaining CSF payments due from MCHP are less than the amount owed by the County to MCHP under this Section, the County shall pay the amount due to MCHP not later than December 15 of the year following the year in which the reduction occurs.  An appeal of the assessed value does not defer the payment of the CSF.  The CSF shall be paid as set out in paragraph 2 above.  Any adjustments based on the outcome of the appeal shall be in accord with this paragraph.
 
5.         Nonpayment of CSF.
 
In compliance with ORS 307.123(b)(6), if MCHP fails to pay the CSF fee required by ORS 285C.609(4)(b)(B), by the end of the tax year in which it is due, the tax exemption shall be revoked and the property shall be fully taxable for the following tax year for which the fee remains unpaid.  It is agreed that MCHP shall pay the CSF for a total of fifteen (15) years.
 
B.           First Source Agreement.
 
To target the Countys unemployed and underemployed population and comply with the requirements of ORS 285C.606(5), MCHP entered into an Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement (FSA), with the Multnomah County or its designated contact agency(s) as
defined in OAR 123-070-1100.  MCHP will execute the template FSA adopted by the County and the City for the Gresham Strategic Investment Zone # 1.  An executed copy of the new FSA is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 2.  Compliance with the terms of the new FSA is a requirement of this agreement.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 4 of 24
 
 
In consideration of the Countys and Citys actions to approve a SIP exemption for the Project, MCHP agrees to fill the role of an exemplary corporate citizen in Multnomah County as provided in this Agreement.  Such a citizen helps prepare the unemployed and underemployed, including the emerging workforce from local high schools, community colleges, and universities, for entry level jobs which provide career paths, family wages, and excellent benefits, including childcare referrals and negotiations of group rates, which help assure the success of the employee in those jobs.  An exemplary corporate citizen also leads the business community by progressing toward a goal to have no negative impact on the environment through state-of-the-art transportation and environmental programs.  And, an exemplary corporate citizen positively affects the educational and economic well-being of the community in which it resides by directing its efforts and resources to the benefit of its communitys citizens and businesses.  By meeting the performance requirements specified in this Agreement, MCHP will meet its responsibilities as an exemplary corporate citizen.
 
A.           Hiring, Wages, Benefits, Training and Retention.
 
County goals:
 
To create long term jobs with family wages, benefits and working conditions for County residents or creation of a full spectrum of jobs for residents of Multnomah County who are unemployed or underemployed, with a clear career track from entry-level jobs to family wage jobs.
 
To provide educational opportunities to enhance upward mobility for both technical and management roles.
 
To minimize the number of contracted on-site jobs that pay low wages.
 
MCHP acknowledges these County goals and agrees to take the following actions in support of those goals:
 
1.         Local Hiring.
 
MCHPs goal is to hire many local candidates.  MCHP will focus on previous employees who have directly related semiconductor fabrication experience.  Once MCHP has exhausted those rehiring possibilities, MCHP will work with WorkSystems, Inc. or other provider appointed by the County, to find more qualified candidates.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 5 of 24
 
2.         Retention of Existing Jobs and New Hires.
 
a.         Number of Jobs.
 
MCHP currently projects that, at a minimum, the following jobs will be retained or created at the Project (totals refer to the total number of jobs at the Project including jobs retained and jobs created) in the following calendar years:
 
The preceding table shows the minimum number of jobs which MCHP expects it will create at the Project.  If economic conditions support investments in the Project at the level shown in Section II.A, it is expected that jobs at the Project will exceed the minimum number of jobs shown in the preceding table.  MCHP will report all jobs at the Project in accordance with Section V.
 
b.           Timing.
 
MCHP shall create the total number of jobs at the Project set out in the preceding chart in each of the years shown in that chart.  Each years minimum number of jobs, as set out in the Total row of the chart shown above, shall be created by December 31 of the relevant year.  A new job is created when someone is hired as a regular full-time employee.  The number of employees may be deferred or reduced temporarily due to
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 6 of 24
 
 
delays in commissioning equipment, inability of MCHP to recruit qualified employees, or economic circumstances, either in general or specific to MCHP, leading to a requirement for a deferral in recruitment or a reduction in employment.  If such a deferral or reduction is necessary, MCHP shall notify the County in writing, specifying the reason for the deferral or reduction, the amount of the deferral or reduction, and the expected duration of the circumstances giving rise to the deferral or reduction.  If the County believes that MCHP has deferred or reduced maintaining and creating jobs in violation of this Agreement, the County may commence dispute resolution proceedings under Section VII.A of this Agreement.
 
c.           Additional Employment.
 
Total Project employees may be greater than those indicated in Section IV.2.a.  While MCHP cannot commit to increases, the commitment to the Exclusive Full-Service First Source Hiring Agreement attached as Exhibit 2 of this Agreement shall apply throughout the term of this Agreement.
 
3.         Temporary Employees.
 
MCHP anticipates it will use temporary employees in production tasks only to meet peak production loads and to cover temporary and extended leaves of absence.  A Category One temporary employee, as defined in paragraph 5, below, shall not hold a position longer than six months unless the employee is filling a vacancy created by extended medical leave or a statutorily protected leave.
 
4.         Retention of Employees.
 
MCHP intends to hire and retain employees for many years, and to provide its employees with multiple opportunities to move progressively through the MCHP corporate organization with increasing responsibility.  To carry out these intentions, MCHP shall maintain during the term of this Agreement a transfer policy and an internal posting policy which are substantially similar to the transfer policy and internal posting policy which are attached as Exhibit 3 to this Agreement.
 
It is the intent of the parties that employees hired in new jobs be retained either in the initial position or in progressively more responsible positions within MCHP.  Beginning with the end of fiscal year 2003-04, MCHP shall demonstrate that at least 70% of all of its regular full time employees at the Gresham facilities except those described in the next sentence are retained for at least two years. 
The following employees will not be counted: (1) those terminated for cause; and (2) those that voluntarily terminate employment other than for reasons of inadequacy of child care, transportation or housing.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 7 of 24
 
 
5.         Advancement of Category One Employees.
 
MCHP will source as many Category One Employees as practicable for hire into entry-level production operator jobs.  MCHP currently provides a weeklong training class for all production operators.  In addition, MCHP continually offers in-house training and certification levels to improve performance and employee output.  MCHP shall maintain these programs or substantially similar programs during the term of this Agreement.  Category One Employee means a person holding a job which requires less than a two year college degree or certificate and which is not highly technical in nature.
 
In addition, MCHP shall:
 
 
 
 
6.         Promotional Practices.
 
Microchips practice is to promote approximately 10% of the indirect labor force once per year to the next grade level responsibility. Approximately 40% of the Gresham facilities will be direct labor employees.  Once Microchip places an entry level or category one direct labor employee into grade 90, the following chart illustrates their path.
 
    90---92 - First year promotion
92---94 - Second year promotion
94---96 - Third year promotion
 
Once a Category One employee has reached grade 96 they have had a promotion every year for three years and they have reached the highest grade available.  To continue advancement an employee must take on additional
responsibilities such as supervision or follow a technical path toward engineering.

Investment
 
Microchip provides tuition reimbursement as described in Exhibit 5 up to $10,000 a year for education.  Microchip commits to continue with this level of promotions per year to the extent economic conditions permit, for all employees whose job performance justifies promotion.
 
Direct labor refers to anyone who touches the product or works on the wafer process.  Direct labor positions are classified as production specialists whose costs are included in MCHPs cost per wafer analysis.  Indirect labor refers to any labor positions except direct labor.
 
7.         Wages.
 
MCHP represents that its current wage structure, including base pay, bonus and stock option grants, are competitive with current industry standards. MCHP will continue to maintain competitive wages, and to compare its wages to the Radford Benchmark Survey annually, or its equivalent.  A chart showing wages, benefits, shift differential, and overtime is attached as Exhibit 6.  MCHP commits to reviewing the Radford Benchmark and making any changes to salary ranges that apply, provided that economic conditions allow for such increases in salary ranges.
 
8.         Employer Paid Benefits.
 
a.         In General.
 
MCHP intends to fulfill its role as an exemplary corporate citizen by providing an attractive and competitive benefits package which enables MCHP to recruit and retain qualified employees.  MCHP acknowledges that provision of excellent, competitive benefits is vital, not only to achieving MCHPs corporate objectives, but also to achieve the Countys goals.
 
b.         Specific Benefits.
 
MCHP currently provides all existing US employees at other locations with the benefits described in Exhibit 7 attached to this Agreement.
 
During the period of property tax exemption, MCHP may have to modify its benefits package in order to maintain costs in response to industry or economic conditions or to remain competitive.  The cost to MCHPs employees is the same for all employees regardless of job title or income level.  Employees may choose to insure only themselves, employee plus spouse or employee plus family.  Also included in the attached as Exhibit 7 is a cost analysis for benefit cost for the benefit plan year of May 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010.
 
MCHP shall report the benefits it provides for employees at the Project, and, prior to making any substantial reductions in MCHPs aggregate benefits package, MCHP shall provide reasonable notice to the County.
 
 
Amended Strategic Investment Program Contract - 9 of 24

 9.        Child Care.
 
MCHP will work in good faith to attempt partnership relationships with local childcare facilities to provide discounts for MCHP employees.  MCHP will provide a link to Oregon childcare commission website (http://findit.emp.state.or.us/occc/) on its internal website to facilitate employee access to childcare information.

C.           Failure to Comply with Numerically Ascertainable Terms.
 
It is the intent of the parties that good faith efforts will be made to comply with all the terms of this Agreement.  However, in such a large Project, it is difficult to anticipate all contingencies with accuracy.  In a spirit of fairness and recognizing the cyclical vagaries of business, the County and City agree that variance from numerically ascertainable terms of this Agreement by a plus or minus 5% will not constitute a failure of MCHP to comply with this Agreement. However, the variance is not cumulative.

Payment by MCHP shall not constitute a waiver by MCHP of any matter in dispute.  If the dispute is resolved in favor of MCHP, the County shall refund the amount of overpayment to MCHP, with interest, within 30 days after the dispute is resolved.
the delinquent amount; and, (2) if the payment is made more than 45 business days after the payment is due and written demand has been made to MCHP for payment, the County shall be entitled to receive a penalty of one hundred percent (100%) of the delinquent amount.

If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to meet the job creation or job retention requirements of Section IV.2.a of this Agreement, MCHP shall pay an amount equal to twice the average gross annual salary plus benefits for operators and technicians in the year of the breach for every job not created or job not retained.
 
3.             Failure to Use FSA.
 
If the Breach relates to a failure of MCHP to notify the County in accordance with the FSA of MCHP hiring needs for covered positions, or to hire qualified applicants for covered positions in accordance with the FSA, MCHP shall pay to the County an amount equal to twice the average gross annual salary plus benefits for operators and technicians in the year of the breach for every person who would have been hired though the FSA, but was not so hired because of MCHPs failure.
 
If MCHP fails to act in good faith to meet its obligations under the FSA, and the failure results in effective abandonment of the FSA by MCHP, MCHP shall pay 75 percent of the Property Tax Abatement for each year the abandonment continues.  It shall not constitute an abandonment if MCHPs failure is due to nonperformance by the County of its obligations under the FSA.
