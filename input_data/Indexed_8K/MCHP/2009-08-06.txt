Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
 
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $192.9 million, up 11.4% sequentially from net sales of $173.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 28.1% from net sales of $268.2 million in the
prior years first quarter.  GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, up 23.4% from GAAP net income of $22.0 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 62.8% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $35.0 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, up 25.4% from non-GAAP net income of $27.9 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 57.6% from non-GAAP net income of $82.6 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  Our non-GAAP results exclude any gain or loss on trading securities, the effect of share-based compensation, the impact of our recent acquisition activities, the acquisition of a patent license and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures associated with the adoption of FSP ABP 14-1, .  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 33.9 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 3, 2009 to stockholders of record on August 20, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
During the June quarter we saw a steady improvement in the overall business environment that enabled us to exceed our revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and inventory guidance we provided in early June, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter was 1.18, resulting in our opening backlog position for the September quarter being significantly higher than our backlog entering the June quarter.
In the June quarter we achieved GAAP gross margins of 50.0% and non-GAAP gross margins of 51.4%.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up over 200 basis points from the March quarter and we expect significant gross margin improvement again in the September quarter, continued Mr. Sanghi.

Reports First Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
Our microcontroller businesses performed well in the June quarter and revenues were up 11.9% sequentially.  Our 16-bit microcontroller revenues were up 15.7% sequentially and 33.3% year-over-year, said Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  We shipped a record 35,608 development systems in the June quarter, and have now exceeded 800,000 in cumulative development tool shipments.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $17.6 million in the June quarter compared to the March 2009 quarter.  We greatly reduced the days of inventory on our balance sheet, ending June with 108 days of inventory, 26 days lower than the March 2009 balance.  In the June quarter, days of inventory in the distribution channel were flat to the prior quarter at 38 days.  Our inventory is in a very good position to allow us to ramp production activities to be in line with anticipated demand levels.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the June quarter our cash, short-term and long-term investment position was essentially flat, dropping by only $2.6 million.  We expect our cash and investment position to increase in the September quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Despite the continued weakness in the global economy, we are seeing improving trends in Microchips business and our overall visibility.  We expect revenue for the September quarter to be up between 7% and 11% sequentially.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related acquired inventory valuation cost and intangible asset amortization, other acquisition-related expenditures, non-cash interest expense, gains and losses on trading securities, other non-recurring items in our business and the related income tax implications of these items.

Fiscal 2010 Results
SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. 
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our
budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
