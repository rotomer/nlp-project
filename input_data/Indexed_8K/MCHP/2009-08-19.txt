Amendments to 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
On August 14, 2009, the stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated (the Company) approved an amendment and restatement of the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan) to (i) modify the automatic grant provisions with respect to equity compensation for non-employee directors to provide for annual awards of options and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), rather than just options, and to provide for a one-time award of RSUs to serve as a retention mechanism and (ii) revise the definition of "performance goals" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  As amended, the Equity Plan provides for the following equity compensation for our non-employee directors (a) on first appointment as a director, an initial grant of an option to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock and $60,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date), each subject to four-year vesting, (b) an annual grant of an option to purchase 3,000 shares of common stock subject to vesting over 12 months and $30,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date) subject to two-year vesting; and (c) for non-employee directors who as of the 2009 annual meeting have served as our director for at least five years, a one-time grant of $100,000 in RSUs (based on the market price of our stock on the grant date) subject to four-year vesting.  
The amendment and restatement was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on June 1, 2009.
The purpose of the change in equity compensation for our non-employee directors is to enable us to continue to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors.  The purpose of the amendment to the definition of "performance goals" under the Equity Plan is to give the Compensation Committee more flexibility in structuring equity compensation arrangements that will qualify as "performance based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
A copy of the Equity Plan, as amended and restated, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

Shares used to pay the exercise price or purchase price, if applicable, of an Award shall become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.  To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than stock, such cash payment shall not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.

check;
 
(3)
 
other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option have been owned by the Participant for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;

An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan.

Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the optioned stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 19 of the Plan.

In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination.  If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan.  If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
(h)

If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement).  In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for six (6) months following the Participants termination.

If no such representative has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.  In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participants death.
