Reports Second Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
 
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $226.7 million, up 17.5% sequentially from net sales of $192.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down approximately 16% from net sales of $269.7 million in the prior years second fiscal quarter.  GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $44.5 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, up 62.5% from GAAP net income of $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 41.3% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $53.2 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, up 51.9% from non-GAAP net income of $35 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 36.3% from non-GAAP net income of $83.5 million, or 45 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second fiscal quarter.  Our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures associated with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, which requires us to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Debt with Conversion and Other Options  Cash Conversion,
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on December 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2009.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
During the September quarter we experienced strength in all geographies and product lines, allowing us to exceed our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively in early September, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
We achieved GAAP gross margins of 54.4% and non-GAAP gross margins of 55.5%.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up over 400 basis points from the June quarter, and we expect another 150 to 200 basis points of gross margin improvement in the December quarter as we continue to increase production levels in our factories in response to improving business conditions, continued Mr. Sanghi.

Reports Second Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
Our microcontroller business delivered excellent results and revenue was up 16.6% sequentially, and we shipped a record 38,086 development tools.  Our 16-bit microcontrollers posted a very strong sequential revenue growth of 49.1%, as well as a 70.3% growth from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business executed on all fronts and revenue grew an exceptional 25.5% sequentially.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory levels on Microchips balance sheet decreased by $5.4 million in the September quarter compared to the June quarter.  Inventory days declined from 108 days at June 30, 2009 to 96 days at September 30, 2009.  Days of inventory at our distributors remained flat to the June quarter levels.  We have aggressively increased our manufacturing output so that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the September quarter our cash, short-term and long-term investment position increased by $34.6 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $62.1 million.  We expect our cash generation to remain strong for the balance of fiscal year 2010.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business and excellent execution by our employees.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the September quarter was 1.15, resulting in our opening backlog position for the December quarter being significantly higher than our backlog entering the September quarter. While there are fewer shipping days in Europe and the Americas this quarter, based on the improved visibility and general business conditions, we expect revenue to be up 4% to 8% sequentially.

Calendar Year 2010 Internal Plan:
In order to provide more insight into our business, Microchip is providing information about our internal plan for calendar year 2010.  It reflects the results we expect from our multi-year demand creation activity that has generated a large number of new designs.  Many of these designs are with new customers in emerging markets and applications that are outside our traditional core areas, which we believe will result in increased market share.
 
 
 
 
Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our recent acquisition activities and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.  Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP
