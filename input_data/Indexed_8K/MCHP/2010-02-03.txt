Item 1.01      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Agreement and Plan of Merger with SST
On February 2, 2010, Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Microchip), Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., a California corporation (SST), and Sun Acquisition Corporation, a California corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement).  The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of SST by Microchip by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into SST, with SST being the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, SST would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microchip (the Merger) and each share of SST common stock (other than those shares owned by SST and with respect to which dissenters rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount of $2.85 per share, without interest.  Each outstanding option or other right to purchase SST common stock (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and the holder of such option or right shall be entitled to receive, subject to any required withholding taxes, an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of SST common stock subject to such option or right and (y) the excess, if any, of $2.85 over the exercise price per share of such SST option or right.
 
The Boards of Directors of Microchip and SST have approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SST.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of Microchip, SST and Merger Sub, including among others, (i) covenants by SST concerning the conduct of its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a covenant by SST that, subject to certain exceptions, the Board of Directors of SST will recommend to its shareholders adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) a covenant that SST will not solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowing facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to or that would be reasonably expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Microchip and SST and further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances SST may be required to pay Microchip a termination fee.  Under specified circumstances, SST may be required to reimburse certain of Microchips expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.  Microchip plans to file a copy of the Merger Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for its third quarter ended December 31, 2009.  We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement for a more complete understanding of the transaction.
 
On February 3, 2010, Microchip issued a press release relating to the Merger.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI) for $2.85 per share in cash.

As separately announced today by SST, SST has terminated its previously announced merger agreement prior to entering into the definitive agreement with Microchip.  
CHANDLER, Arizona  February 3, 2010  (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductors, announced today that
 
The acquisition has been approved by the Boards of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2010, subject to approval by SSTs stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 
SSTs Superflash technology and extensive patent portfolio are critical building blocks for advanced microcontrollers, said   This acquisition enables Microchip to gain earlier access to SSTs advanced technologies, as well as the ability to customize technology variants that can give us an advantage over competing technologies.
Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.
 
We believe this is an attractive transaction for SSTs stockholders, as it presents a significant premium to the prior transaction and requires no external financing, continued Mr. Sanghi.  We look forward to completing this transaction early in the second calendar quarter of 2010.

Reports Third Quarter
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
During the December quarter we experienced strong growth in all geographies and product lines, which resulted in us exceeding the revenue, gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively in late November, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, up 350 basis points from the September quarter, and we expect another 75 to 125 basis points of gross margin improvement in the March quarter as we continue to see the benefits from increased production levels in our factories in response to improving business conditions.  We now believe that we are positioned to reach our previous record high non-GAAP gross margin of 61.6% by the end of fiscal year 2011, continued Mr. Sanghi.
 
Our microcontroller business delivered excellent results; revenue was up 10.0% sequentially and we shipped a record 41,492 development tools.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10%, as well as 101.4% growth from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 14.1% sequential growth and exceeded an annual revenue run rate of $100 million for the first time in Microchips history.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Due to the much stronger than expected growth in revenue and despite the significant ramp in manufacturing output, our inventory at 99 days remains well below our internal target of 115 days."
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the December quarter, our cash and investments position increased by $26.9 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $62.5 million.  We expect our cash generation to continue to be strong in the March quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business in the December 2009 quarter.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the December quarter was 1.12, providing us with excellent visibility.  We started the March 2010 quarter with a record high opening backlog.  On the other hand, the Lunar New Year holidays will have an adverse seasonal impact on our business in Asia.  Taking all these factors into consideration we expect revenue to be up 3% to 7% sequentially.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our true operating costs.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
