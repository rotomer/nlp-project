Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.2 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010.
The March quarter was another exceptional growth quarter for Microchip across all geographies and product lines, which resulted in us achieving 11.2% sequential revenue growth and exceeding our gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we revised positively on March 15, 2010, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.
Non-GAAP gross margins were a record 61.63%, up over 260 basis points from the December quarter.  Our achievement of this level of gross margin percentage is a full year ahead of our previous expectation.  Microchips factories are running at higher levels of production output than they have ever produced in the history of the company, continued Mr. Sanghi.
Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results with revenue up a strong 10.3% on a sequential basis and up 58.2% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue and was up 22.9% sequentially and up 133.3% from the year ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress with 36% sequential growth from a small but rapidly growing base, and building upon the 44% sequential growth it experienced in the December quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 19.3% sequential growth, and was up 91.6% from the year ago quarter.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Due to the exceptional revenue growth we experienced in the March quarter, inventory days on Microchips balance sheet decreased from 99 at the end of the December quarter to 97 at March 31, 2010.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 and with the incremental activities we have deployed to meet customer demand we expect to build a few days of inventory in

the June quarter.  Days of inventory in the distribution channel were relatively flat in the March 2010 quarter compared to December 31, 2009.  Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased only 1.4% sequentially in the March quarter and was actually down 4.4% from the levels of our prior peak earnings quarter of September 2008.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, In the March quarter, our cash and investments position increased by $31.9 million after payment of our quarterly cash dividend of $63.0 million.  We expect our cash generation to continue to be strong in fiscal 2011.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited to have closed the acquisition of Silicon Storage Technology Inc. (SST) on April 8, 2010.  We are working diligently on the integration activities associated with SST which include taking actions to achieve strong financial returns from the continuing businesses, integrating the SST employees into the Microchip culture and actively marketing those assets held for sale.  We believe the SST transaction will provide substantial long-term value to our stockholders.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We continue to be very pleased with how our business has performed over the past four quarters, during which time we believe we have gained market share in all of our strategic product lines.  Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was 1.36, providing us with excellent visibility.  We started the June 2010 quarter with a record high opening backlog due to the strength of our business combined with lead times extending in the semiconductor industry in general.  In the June 2010 quarter, we expect revenue from Microchips business excluding SST to be up about 8% sequentially and we expect the continuing operations of SST to add about $18 million in revenue to our overall results.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the impact of our acquisition activities, patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acqui sitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature
