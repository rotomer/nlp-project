Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $320.8 million, up 15.4% sequentially from net sales of $278.0 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 66.3% from net sales of $192.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $89.6 million, or 47 cents per diluted share, up 18.3% from GAAP net income of $75.7 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 227.4% from GAAP net income of $27.4 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter.
Consolidated Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $104.2 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, up 20.2% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $86.7 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 197.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $35.0 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  For the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), the acquisition of patent licenses and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.3 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on August 19, 2010.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
"The June quarter was another exceptional quarter for Microchip.  Microchips net sales, excluding SST, grew 8.8% sequentially, we achieved the high end of our gross margin guidance, and exceeded our operating profit and earnings per share guidance that we provided on May 5, 2010," said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  "Microchips non-GAAP gross margins excluding SST were a record 62% for the quarter ending June 2010.  Microchip's factories are running at higher levels of production output than they have ever produced in the history of the company, maintaining the high efficiency, quality and yields for which we are known.  Excluding SST, Microchip's business produced record non-GAAP operating margins of 37.0% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of 51 cents per dil uted share."

The continuing operations of SST produced $18.4 million in net sales, 90% non-GAAP gross margins, 52.5% non-GAAP operating profit, and 4 cents of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share," continued Mr. Sanghi.  "With the sale of several non-core assets and substantial operating expense reductions, we are pleased to achieve operating profitability for SST and announce the very first quarter under Microchips ownership to be accretive to our earnings.  These results exceeded our original guidance for the June quarter provided on May 5, 2010."
"The consolidated results from continuing operations produced net sales of $320.8 million in the June 2010 quarter, non-GAAP gross margins of 63.6%, non-GAAP operating profit of 37.9% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of 55 cents.  We are exceptionally pleased with these record-setting results," Mr. Sanghi added.
"Our microcontroller business delivered superb results with net sales up a strong 9.8% on a sequential basis and up 55.3% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly net sales and was up 26% sequentially and up 154% from the year ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller product line continues to make good progress with 86% sequential growth from a small but rapidly growing base, and building upon the 36% sequential growth it experienced in the June quarter," said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  "Our analog business had another outstanding quarter with 17.8% sequential growth, and was up 101.2% from the year ago quarter."
Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "Microchip's inventory days on its balance sheet decreased from 97 days at the end of March to 96 days at the end of June.  Distribution inventory dropped one day, to 40 days at the end of the June quarter.  Overall inventory combining Microchip and distributor balances was down two days on June 30, 2010 compared to the balances at March 31, 2010.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 and we continue to ramp our factories to increase capacity to meet our customers' demand."
Mr. Bjornholt continued, "We ended the June quarter with a total cash and investment position of approximately $1.5 billion.  We expect our cash generation to be very strong in the September quarter and for the remainder of fiscal 2011."
Mr. Sanghi added, "We continue to make outstanding progress in the integration and restructuring of the SST business including the sale of certain assets.  We announced the consummation of the sale of the NAND drive and certain memory product lines on May 21, 2010.  On July 8, 2010, we announced an exclusive limited license to

Professional Computer Technology, Ltd. that allows them to manufacture certain Serial NOR-Flash products and sell these products to a specific licensed market under its own brand name.  We are progressing well on the sale of the WiFi power amplifier business and continue our rationalization efforts for the various SST memory product lines.  We continue diligent work on the integration activities associated with SST, including taking actions to achieve strong financial returns from the continuing businesses, integrating the SST employees into the Microchip culture and actively marketing those assets that are being held for sale.  We are confident that the SST transaction will provide substantial long-term value to our stockholders."
Mr. Sanghi said, "We are very pleased with how our business has performed in recent quarters and are confident that we have gained market share in our microcontroller and analog markets.  Microchip's book-to-bill ratio for the June quarter excluding SST was approximately 1.41, providing us with a record high opening backlog.  In the September 2010 quarter, we expect net sales from Microchip's business including SST to be up approximately 6% to 7% sequentially.  We expect the continuing operations of SST to deliver approximately $20 million in net sales to our overall results."
Mr. Sanghi concluded, "As we look into the December quarter, our backlog is substantially higher than it was for the September quarter at the same point in time.  We continue to see robust demand around the world, driven by exceptionally strong new design wins in our microcontroller and analog product lines.  We are increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet the projected demands of our customers in the December quarter.  Considering all of this, we expect the December quarter net sales to be up approximately 3% over the September quarter, in our otherwise seasonally weakest quarter of the year."
Acquisition of Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.
On April 8, 2010, Microchip acquired SST, a public company based in Sunnyvale, California, in a merger transaction for $3.05 per share, or a total of $353.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to SST's net assets based upon their estimated fair values as of April 8, 2010. The excess purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. The continuing operations of SST include the licensing and microcontroller divisions.  The discontinued operations include SST's various memory product lines and WiFi power amplifier businesses.  The purchase price allocation resulted in net tangible assets acquired of $231.5 million for continuing operations, and $5 4.5 million for discontinued operations and intangible assets of

$58.7 million ($44.5 million for continuing operations and $14.2 million for discontinued operations).  The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets acquired and intangible assets was recorded to goodwill and amounted to $9.1 million.  The GAAP financial results for SST include purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory valuation costsintangible asset amortization, severance costs, and legal and other general and administrative costs associated with the acquisition.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, the expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acqui sitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
