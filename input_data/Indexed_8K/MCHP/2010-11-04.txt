Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology Inc. (SST) on April 8, 2010.  At the time of the acquisition the Company determined that it would hold SSTs SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses as assets held for sale, in addition to other businesses that Microchip has sold since the acquisition date, said Steve Sanghi, Microchips President and CEO.  After operating the SST business for two quarters, we have found synergies between SSTs RF business and Microchips wireless, microcontroller and analog businesses.  On the memory side, after divesting the low margin business to PCT in Taiwan in a transaction that was announced in July 2010, we have substantially improved the gross margin for the rest of the SuperFlash Memory business. Additionally, we have found that running some volume on the memory business is criti cal to proving out the technology before it can be licensed.  There are also significant operational synergies with Microchips memory business and technology synergies with Microchips microcontroller business.  Therefore, we have decided to integrate the SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses of SST into the ongoing businesses of Microchip, Mr. Sanghi continued.  These businesses added $40.0 million of net sales in the three months ending September 30, 2010, and $76.3 million of net sales in the six months ended September 30, 2010.

As required by GAAP, in this press release and in future filings with the SEC, the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will be presented as if the SST SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses were always included in the continuing operations of Microchip.  Microchips second quarter fiscal 2011 guidance for continuing operations provided on August 5, 2010 did not include the SuperFlash Memory and RF businesses and without these businesses Microchip guided its net sales to be $340 to $343 million for the September quarter.  The actual results for these businesses achieved $342.3 million which is near the high end of the previous guidance.  The remainder of the information included in this press release is presented on a full consolidated basis including all continuing operations of Microchip on this revised basis.
Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were $382.3 million, up 7.0% sequentially from net sales of $357.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 68.7% from net sales of $226.7 million in the prior years second quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, up 14.0% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $91.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 135.5% from GAAP net income of $44.5 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second quarter.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, up 8.8% from consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $109.9 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 124.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, in the prior years second quarter.  For the second fiscal quarters of each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with a cquisitions), the acquisition of patent licenses and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.4 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on December 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2010.  In light of the expected tax law changes coming in January 2011, the highest federal tax

rate on dividends is likely to go from 15% currently to 39.6% on January 1, 2011.  While we do not know what the current congress or the newly elected congress and President Obama may decide on the expiration of President Bushs tax cuts, we believe that our investors deserve to pay the lowest tax rate on dividends paid by Microchip.  Therefore, Microchip will accelerate its dividend payment from March 2011 into late December 2010.  The Board of Directors has declared this cash dividend on its common stock of 34.5 cents per share.  This dividend is payable on December 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 13, 2010.  After this payment, Microchips next dividend payment will be in June of 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Mr. Sanghi said, The September quarter was an all-time record for Microchip in many respects.  Microchips net sales for the September quarter were a record $382.3 million and were up 7% sequentially.  Non-GAAP operating income was an all-time record high of $138.2 million, at 36.2% of sales.  Our August 5, 2010 guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share was 58 cents and our non-GAAP EPS for the September quarter was a record 63 cents.  We are proud to present these record breaking results to our stakeholders.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited that we have completed the integration and restructuring of SST and have transformed SST into a very profitable entity that was accretive to Microchips non-GAAP earnings per share by about 8 cents for the September quarter.  We expect SST to add approximately 32 cents to Microchips non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2011 and about 40 cents for fiscal year 2012.
Our microcontroller business delivered another all-time record in net sales for Microchip of $256.7 million and was up 4.7% sequentially.  Net sales of our 16-bit microcontrollers were up 22% sequentially and more than doubled from the year ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Net sales of our 32-bit microcontrollers were down 10.9% sequentially, and up 225% year over year.   In the first six months of this fiscal year, 32-bit microcontroller sales are up 320% over the same period last year from a small but rapidly growing base.  We expect to see significant growth in this product line over the next several years.  Our analog products produced the sixth consecutive double-digit sales growth quarter, achieving 11.6% sequential growth, and was up 99.8% from the year ago quarter.

Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory days on its balance sheet decreased from 98 days at the end of June to 97 days at the end of September.  Inventory days remain well below our internal target of 115 days, leaving us well-positioned to use the current business environment to replenish our inventory levels, which should allow us to shorten lead times and appropriately support our customers.  Distribution inventory in the September quarter increased to 34 days from 33 days at the end of the June quarter.  Overall inventory combining Microchip and distributor balances were flat at September 30, 2010 compared to the balances at June 30, 2010 at 131 days.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, The September quarter was an all-time record for Microchip in net cash generation.  We achieved $156.9 million in net cash generation prior to the payment of our $63.9 million dividend in the September quarter.  We ended the September 2010 quarter with $1.57 billion in cash and investments and we expect strong cash generation for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
Mr. Sanghi added, Microchips net sales have grown from $226.7 million in the September 2009 quarter to $382.3 million in the September quarter 2010, a growth of 68.7%.  Annualizing our September quarter results, we are now over a $1.5 billion sales run rate and we believe we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of $2 billion in net sales in the coming years.  We are confident that Microchip has continued to gain market share in the microcontroller and analog markets.  We did experience a slowdown in bookings activity in the September quarter, as customers and distributors adjust their backlog and inventory.  This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.87 and therefore we are cautious regarding the revenue outlook for the December quarter.  We expect net sales to be down approximately 2% to 8% sequentially in the December quarter, which is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year.

Our Non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, any gain or loss on trading securities, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, purchased inventory costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), patent portfolio licenses, non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and the related income tax implications of these items.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acqui sitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
