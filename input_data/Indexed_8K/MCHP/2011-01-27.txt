Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $367.8 million, down 3.8% sequentially from net sales of $382.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 47.1% from net sales of $250.1 million in the prior years third quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $101.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, down 2.7% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 46.9% from GAAP net income of $69.4 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third quarter.  Due to the appreciation in the price of our common stock in the December 2010 quarter, the dilutive share count reflects the effect of our convertible debentures, with the effect of an additional 4.4 million shares sequentially, which negatively impacted our GAAP diluted earnings per share by about 1.2 cents.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $113.8 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, down 4.9% from consolidated non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 62.2% from consolidated non-GAAP net income of $70.1 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third quarter.  Due to the appreciation in the price of our common stock in the December 2010 quarter, the dilutive share count reflects the effect of our convertible debentures, with the effect of an additional 4.4 million shares sequentially, which negatively impacted our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by about 1.3 cents.  For the third fiscal quarter of both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, our consolidated non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), the tax benefit from tax audit settlements and tax law changes and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip announced on November 4, 2010 that its Board of Directors accelerated the March 2011 quarterly cash dividend payment on its common stock of 34.5 cents per share into the December 31, 2010 quarter.  Microchips next dividend payment will be in June of 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchips performance in the December 2010 quarter exceeded our expectations.  Net sales, gross margins, operating income and earnings per share were better than the mid-point of our guidance provided on November 30, 2010, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  The gross margin upside was driven by ongoing cost reductions in our manufacturing processes, a favorable product mix and continued improvements in the product lines we acquired from SST.  Operating expenses continue to be well managed and came in at the mid-point of our guidance at 24.1% of sales on a non-GAAP basis in the December quarter.

Mr. Sanghi added, The SST acquisition has done exceptionally well for Microchip.  The technology licensing business produced an all-time record high in revenue of $19.1 million, up 10.3% sequentially.  Additionally, in the December quarter we continued to make outstanding progress in improving the operating models for the SuperFlash Memory division and the RF division through our hard work in partnering with customers, targeting markets, focusing on pricing, improving manufacturing costs and incorporating these divisions into Microchips business structure.  We believe there are significant improvements ahead of us for the gross margins of these divisions and we are well on our way to achieving 32 cents of non-GAAP earnings per share from the SST acquisition in fiscal 2011 and 40 cents in fiscal 2012.
Our microcontroller business performed better than we expected in the December quarter with net sales only down 2.2% on a sequential basis and up 24% from the year ago quarter.  We shipped our 9 billionth cumulative microcontroller in December and finished calendar 2010 shipping a record 1.3 billion microcontrollers.  For calendar 2010 our microcontroller revenue was up 42.4% from the calendar 2009 levels, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our 32-bit microcontroller line, which took a pause in the September quarter, had a strong quarter of revenue growth and was up 45% sequentially, achieving a new record.  For calendar 2010, net sales for our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 113.6% and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 260%.  We believe we gained significant market share in all three microcontroller segments in calendar 2010.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory position improved significantly in the December quarter.  Inventory on Microchips balance sheet increased to $177.7 million, representing 107 days of inventory and a sequential increase of 10 days.  We continue to make progress in moving towards our internal target of 115 days of inventory which will allow us to improve our lead times to levels in line with our historical performance and appropriately support our customers.  Inventory days in the distribution channel grew by three days.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, Microchips net cash generation in the December quarter was $133.5 million prior to making the two dividend payments, which totaled $129.4 million.  We ended the December 2010 quarter with $1.57 billion of cash and investments and we expect our cash generation in the March 2011 quarter to continue to be strong.

Mr. Sanghi added, Looking back at calendar year 2010, Microchip had one of its best growth years ever with over 64% revenue growth, compared to calendar year 2009.  As we enter calendar 2011, we believe we are exceptionally well-positioned for continued growth in all of our product lines.  The March quarter will be seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia.  Taking all of these factors into consideration we expect net sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.

adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
