acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were a record $1.487 billion, an increase of 56.9% from net sales of $947.7 million in the prior fiscal year.  On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was a record $429.2 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, an increase of 97.8% from net income of $217.0 million, or $1.16 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 was a record $462.3 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, an increase of 88.7% from net income of $245.0 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.6 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on June 2, 2011 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Microchips performance in the March 2011 quarter and in fiscal year 2011 was outstanding.  We exceeded the high end of our gross margin and earnings per share guidance, even with the challenging backdrop of the world economy and the Japan crisis, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  The March quarter marked our 82 consecutive quarter of profitability and is a testimony to the resiliency of our business model.
nd
Mr. Sanghi added, Fiscal 2011 was a record year for Microchip in sales, profitability and earnings per share.  Our 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and analog product lines all achieved new full year revenue records and our licensing business achieved a record quarterly revenue in the March 2011 quarter.
In the March 2011 quarter our microcontroller business performed at the high end of our expectations, with revenue up 4% on a sequential basis, and up 17% from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 24% sequentially and was up 86% from the year-ago quarter.  Our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 35% sequentially and was up 226% from the year-ago quarter.  Our analog business was up 3.5% sequentially, and was up 45% from the year-ago quarter.

Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Inventory on Microchips balance sheet at March 31, 2011 was $180.8 million, representing 107 days of inventory, which was flat in days to the prior quarter level.  Our internal target for inventory days is 115, and we plan to continue to build inventory towards that target to maintain short lead times and support our customers delivery requirements.  Inventory days at our distributors increased to 40 days, compared to 39 days at the end of the prior quarter.
Mr. Bjornholt continued, Microchips net cash and investment balance grew by $135.3 million in the March quarter.  We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.71 billion of cash and investments and we expect continued strong cash generation in the June 2011 quarter.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We continue to evaluate the effects that the tragedy in Japan may have on our business.  We have a strong backlog position for the June quarter, but there is still some uncertainty regarding the impact from the Japan crisis on the world economy.  Taking these factors into consideration, we expect net sales in the June 2011 quarter to be up sequentially between 1% and 6%.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The value of our trading securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are non-cash expenses related to such transactions.  Our acquisitions of patent portfolio licenses and tax events related to IRS settlements, changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events or, in the case of our trading securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

The estimated negative impact on our earnings per diluted share calculation resulting from the difference in our assumed average stock price for the June 2011 quarter as compared to the March 2011 quarter is about one cent, when combining the additional dilutive effect from our convertible debt, and the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards.
