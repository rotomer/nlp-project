CHANDLER, Arizona  August 4, 2011  (NASDAQ: MCHP)  Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today reported results for the three months ended June 30, 2011 as summarized in the following table:

See the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this release.
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $374.5 million, down 1.4% sequentially from net sales of $380.0 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 4.9% from net sales of $357.1 million in the prior years first quarter.  GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $99.3 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, down 24% from GAAP net income of $130.6 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 8.1% from GAAP net income of $91.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted
in the prior years first quarter.  GAAP net income in the March 2011 quarter included a benefit of $24.4 million in one-time tax events that increased net income per diluted share by 12 cents.

Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $111.4 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, down 6.4% from non-GAAP net income of $119.0 million, or 59 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 1.3% from non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first quarter.  For the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.7 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend is payable on September 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on August 18, 2011.  Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
We saw broad-based softness in our business due to weak global economic conditions, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO.  This manifested itself into demand and bookings weakness across multiple market segments and multiple customers in each segment.
Mr. Sanghi added, As we expected, this weakness has now been reflected in the guidance of multiple companies in the semiconductor industry.
While our microcontroller business was down 2% sequentially, our 32-bit microcontroller business had another strong quarter of growth with revenue up 18.7% sequentially, and up 108% from the year-ago quarter, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.  Design win momentum in all of our product lines continues to be strong and we expect these wins to contribute to revenue growth as the economic headwinds we are experiencing subside.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, In the June quarter, inventory on our balance sheet grew to 119 days.  Inventory levels at our distributors grew by 3 days sequentially to end the June quarter at 43
days.  We are comfortable with these inventory levels given the long life cycle for our products, and we continue to view our short lead times as a competitive advantage.

Mr. Sanghi concluded, While we are obviously disappointed with our June quarter results, we believe we are well-positioned to grow market share over the long term in our microcontroller, analog and licensing product lines.  However, in the September 2011 quarter we expect to continue to experience the lingering effects of weak global economic conditions.  Therefore, we expect net sales in the September 2011 quarter to be down sequentially in percentage terms by low to mid single digits.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement.  Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant.  The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management.  The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions.  Tax events related to IRS settlements, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other one-time tax events are non-recurring events in our business.  Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in

understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business.  Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending.  As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature or to the one-time nature of the events.  Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.  Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
