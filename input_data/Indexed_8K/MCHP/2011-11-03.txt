per diluted share, down 20.1% from GAAP net income of $99.3 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.3% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $92.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, down 16.8% from non-GAAP net income of $111.4 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 22.6% from non-GAAP net income of $119.6 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), losses on equity securities, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.8 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 5, 2011 to stockholders of record on November 21, 2011.
Our September quarter results are consistent with what others in the industry have reported. The poor economic conditions are impacting the broader semiconductor industry as can be seen from the earnings reports over the past few weeks, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. The overall macroeconomic environment is weak and the Christmas build season did not materialize as expected during the quarter. We saw broad-based weakness across all sales channels in all geographies.
Mr. Sanghi added, We continue to invest in new products and technologies and believe we are well-positioned to gain market share in our strategic product lines as market conditions improve.
Our 32-bit microcontroller business demonstrated strong revenue growth in the September quarter and was up 10.4% on a sequential basis, and was up over 158% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer.

Our analog revenue was down only 0.7% sequentially which was significantly better than most of our industry peers. Our analog attach strategy is working well and we are continuing to gain market share in analog, added Mr. Moorthy.
Mark Reiten, Vice President of Microchip's Licensing division commented, Our licensing business achieved a new record in the September quarter producing $22 million in revenue, up 6.5% sequentially and up 27.3% over the year ago quarter. Our SuperFlash technology continues to be recognized as a best-in-class flash technology for embedded applications. We continue to expand the number of licensees that are using this technology at various wafer foundries, as well as fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchip's cash and investment balance at the end of the September quarter was $1.78 billion and grew by $58.1 million during the quarter. Microchip paid a dividend of $66.3 million in the September quarter and cumulative dividends paid have now exceeded $1.5 billion.
While the floods in Thailand have been devastating for its citizens and for many businesses, particularly those north of Bangkok, our two facilities located almost 50 miles east of Bangkok have continued to operate normally, said Mr. Moorthy. We have experienced sporadic issues with our supply chain, all of which have been mitigated by triggering our contingency plans and use of alternative sourcing. We continue to work to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees, while supporting our customers' business needs.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, The macroeconomic conditions continue to be weak, but we believe that the shipment rates in December will be below the consumption rates of our customers. We expect the inventory burn-off to be largely over by the end of the December quarter and anticipate the December quarter to mark the bottom of this industry cycle for revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. We are modeling December quarter revenue to be flat to down seven percent. We expect the March 2012 quarter to be sequentially up in revenue, gross margin and earnings.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Tax events related to IRS settlements, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other one-time tax events are non-recurring events in our business. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income,
and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically,
we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
