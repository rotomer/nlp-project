year's third fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $77.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, down 2.3% from GAAP net income of $79.3 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.0% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $101.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. GAAP net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was favorably impacted by special income of $0.7 million associated with acquisitions occurring in prior fiscal years and $4.1 million from non-recurring tax events.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $85.4 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, down 7.7% from non-GAAP net income of $92.6 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 24.9% from non-GAAP net income of $113.8 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), non-recurring tax events, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 34.9 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 6, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2012.
Our December quarter results were consistent with the guidance we provided on November 3, 2011 and marked our 85
th
consecutive quarter of profitability, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Microchip entered this industry down cycle about one quarter earlier than most of our industry peers, and we believe that our December quarter results combined with our March quarter guidance confirms that we also expect to exit this cycle a quarter earlier than most.
Mr. Sanghi added, We believe our inventory levels and short lead times, combined with our strong product portfolio, position us well to gain market share in our microcontroller and analog product lines.
Our 32-bit microcontroller business had an outstanding quarter and produced revenue growth of 33.7% on a sequential basis, and was up 137.3% from the year-ago quarter to achieve a new record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Despite the challenging environment, this product line continues to demonstrate strong growth as many new designs continue to go to production.

Our analog business produced another good quarter with revenue up 1.75% sequentially compared to other analog companies being down in double digit percentages sequentially. We have continued to introduce a steady stream of new products targeting a broad range of applications and are winning many new customers and designs, said Mr. Rich Simoncic, Vice President of Analog Products.
Mark Reiten, Vice President of Microchips Licensing division commented, Our licensing business posted a new record in the December quarter achieving $23.1 million in revenue, up 4.9% sequentially and up 21% over the year ago quarter. Our SuperFlash technology continues to be recognized as the best-in-class flash technology for embedded applications. We continue to expand the number of licensees that are using this technology at various wafer foundries, as well as fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, The combined inventory position of Microchip and its distributors decreased by 6 days during the December quarter. The inventory on our balance sheet was up 5 days while distribution inventory declined 11 days on a sequential basis. At this time we believe the majority of the inventory correction has been completed for our customers and our distributors
Mr. Sanghi concluded, While the March 2012 quarter will as usual be seasonally impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia, we believe that Microchip will start to see the beginning of our recovery from the inventory correction. Taking this into consideration, we expect revenue in the March 2012 quarter to be up between one and five percent and are forecasting sequential improvements in non-GAAP gross margins, operating margins and earnings per share.

amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn-out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), losses on equity securities, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, the related income tax implications of these items and nonrecurring tax events.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items

relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
