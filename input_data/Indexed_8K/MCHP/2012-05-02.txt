Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 were $338.9 million, up 3.0% sequentially from net sales of $329.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 10.8% from net sales of $380.0 million in the prior years fourth quarter. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was $80.6 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, up 4.1% from GAAP net income of $77.5 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 38.3% from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $130.6 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the prior years fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, GAAP net income includes a special charge for a patent license settlement of $1.5 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, GAAP net income includes a special charge of $0.2 million and a one-time favorable tax benefit of $24.4 million which includes the settlement of an IRS audit for tax years through March 31, 2008, and other one-time tax events.

our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), patent license settlements, non-recurring tax events, and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 were $1.383 billion, a decrease of 7.0% from net sales of $1.487 billion in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 was $336.7 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, a decrease of 21.5% from net income from continuing operations of $429.2 million, or $2.20 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 was $383.7 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, a decrease of 17.0% from net income from continuing operations of $462.3 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.
Our March quarter results were consistent with the guidance we provided on February 2, 2012 and marked our 86
th
consecutive quarter of profitability, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. The March quarter was a transitional quarter for us as we returned to sequential growth in revenue, gross margin and profits. We went into this down cycle one quarter earlier than most of the semiconductor industry and we predicted we would come out of this cycle a quarter earlier than most. Based on the results of many of our industry peers, this prediction has played out exactly as we expected.
Mr. Sanghi added, With revenue up sequentially 3% in the March quarter, our results turned out to be good in an otherwise seasonally weak period impacted by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. On a Non-GAAP basis, gross margin improved by 133 basis points sequentially, operating profit was up by 7.6% sequentially and operating profit percentage was 31.9% of sales. This was an excellent result for a transitional quarter and we believe the results will continue to improve in fiscal 2013. We believe our inventory levels and short lead times, combined with our strong product portfolio have positioned us well to gain market share in our microcontroller and analog product lines.

Our microcontroller business was up 5.5% on a sequential basis in the March quarter, with both 8-bit and 16-bit product line revenue up sequentially, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. Our 16-bit business was up 19.3% sequentially in the March quarter, as our business recovered sharply from the inventory correction many of our customers went through over the last three quarters. Despite the broad-based market weakness, our strong design win momentum enabled us to overcome the macro trend and significantly outgrow the market.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory at March 31, 2012 was $217.3 million or 137 days, flat to the prior quarter levels. Inventory at our distributors was 31 days which is down 4 days from the prior quarter level. As measured in days, our distributors have the lowest level of inventory that they have held in the last ten years.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, We entered the June quarter with a stronger backlog position than what we entered the March quarter with and bookings have continued to be good. We expect revenue in the June quarter to be up between 3 and 7 percent sequentially and are forecasting improvements in gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 31, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 17, 2012.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net including gains (losses) on equity method investments, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraphs, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our
-- more --

investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in
understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
