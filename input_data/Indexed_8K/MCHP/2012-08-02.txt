Financial Results

GAAP net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $352.1 million, up 3.9% sequentially from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 6.0% from net sales of $374.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $78.7 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, down 2.4% from GAAP net income of $80.6 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 20.7% from GAAP net income of $99.3 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first fiscal quarter.
Non-GAAP net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $352.4 million, up 4.0% sequentially from net sales of $338.9 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 5.9% from net sales of $374.5 million in the prior years first fiscal quarter. Non-GAAP net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.3 million higher than GAAP net sales due to the sell-through of inventory held by distributors of Roving Networks at the date we acquired the company not being included in our GAAP results. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $96.9 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, up 2.7% from non-GAAP net income of $94.3 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the immediately preceding quarter, and down 13.0% from non-GAAP net income of $111.4 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the prior years first fiscal quarter. For the first quarters of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, earn out adjustments and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.1 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on September 5, 2012 to stockholders of record on August 22, 2012.
Our June quarter results were consistent with what we had guided during our last earnings call. The quarter started out strong, but the negative effects of Europe and weaker economic activity in the U.S. led us to finish the quarter slightly lower than the mid- point of our revenue guidance, said Steve Sanghi, President and CEO. Non-GAAP gross margins were up 85 basis points sequentially, leading to an improvement in operating profit, which was 32.7% of sales.

Mr. Sanghi added, We were pleased with the strong performance from our microcontroller and analog businesses where revenue from our strategic products of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog were up sequentially. Net sales on microcontrollers and analog were up sequentially 5.1% and 9%, respectively.
Mr. Sanghi added, We are excited to have closed the acquisition of SMSC today. Now we begin the next phase, which is integrating the two companies together to bring the combined power of these two innovative companies to the marketplace.
Our 16-bit business was up 23.7% sequentially in the June quarter, and up 18.6% from the year ago quarter, to achieve an all-time record, said Ganesh Moorthy, Chief Operating Officer. After a pause in the March quarter, our 32-bit business was up an outstanding 71.5% sequentially in the June quarter to achieve another new record. Both the 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses continue to benefit from the many demand creation actions we have taken as more customers who have selected the PIC
microcontroller platform have either commenced production or ramped their volumes. Our design-win momentum remains strong, and while we are not immune to macro business conditions, we continue to outgrow the secular growth patterns for these businesses.
Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, Microchips inventory at June 30, 2012 was $221.5 million or 136 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter level. Inventory at distribution was flat sequentially at 31 days and is very low compared to historical levels. The inventory held on our balance sheet provides very short lead times and allows us to respond quickly to the needs of our customers.
Mr. Sanghi concluded, Our September quarter guidance includes SMSC from August 2 to September 30, 2012. Our economic assumptions are that the U.S. economic recovery has stalled, the Europe economic situation will continue to be challenged and China, which has been the engine of growth, is starting to slow down. Based on our analysis, we expect our net sales in the September quarter to be up from 17% to 22% sequentially. This guidance includes estimated non-GAAP net sales of $65 million to $70 million from SMSC products from August 2 to the end of the quarter.

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Outlook:
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Due to the closing of the SMSC acquisition just today, we are not able to provide GAAP guidance at this time, as the purchase accounting valuation adjustments related to the acquisition including acquired intangibles and inventory write-up as well as other acquisition-related charges are not known at this time. We are able to provide the following Non-GAAP guidance:

administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), and non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, the related income tax implications of these items and nonrecurring tax events.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. The value of our equity securities varies in amount from period to period and is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of such securities that we cannot predict and are not within the control of management. The non-GAAP adjustments related to the impact of our acquisitions, nonrecurring tax events and a portion of our interest expense related to our convertible debentures are either non-cash expenses or non-recurring expenses related to such transactions. Accordingly, management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax/tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which exclude the items noted in the immediately preceding paragraph, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Specifically,

we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. As described above, the economic substance behind our decision to exclude such items relates either to these charges being non-cash in nature, or to the one-time nature of the events, or in the case of distributor inventory acquired in an acquisition being recognized as net sales for non-GAAP purposes on sell-through to provide comparability between periods for the results of the acquired company, or in the case of our equity securities, because such item is difficult to predict and not within the control of management. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
