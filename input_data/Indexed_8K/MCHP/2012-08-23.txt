(1)
Multiple Administrative Bodies
. The Plan may be administered by different Committees with respect to different groups of Service Providers.
(2)
Section 162(m)
. To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Options granted hereunder as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more outside directors within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(3)
Rule 16b-3
. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.

Powers of the Administrator

(2)
to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder (other than the automatic grants to Non-Employee Directors provided for in Section 17 of the Plan);
(3)
to determine whether and to what extent Awards or any combination thereof, are granted under the Plan;
(4)
to determine the number of shares of Common Stock or equivalent units to be covered by each Award granted under the Plan;
(5)
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
(6)
to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted under the Plan. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options or SARs may be exercised or other Awards vest (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
(7)
to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;
(8)
to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;

(10)
to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;

to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award (or distribution of a Deferred Stock Unit) that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld (but no more). The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;

to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards; and

In so doing, the Administrator may specify that an Option may not be exercised until the completion of a service period.
(e)
Form of Consideration
. The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. Subject to Applicable Laws, such consideration may consist entirely of:
(1)
cash;
(2)
check;
(3)
other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option have been owned by the Participant for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;

An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the optioned stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 19 of the Plan.
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
(h)

. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for six (6) months following the Participants termination. If, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
(i)
Death of Participant
. If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participants death within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the personal representative of the Participants estate, provided such representative has been designated prior to Participants death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such representative has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participants will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.

For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit and
Deferred Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the Change of Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share (or with respect to Performance Units, the cash equivalent thereof) subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change of Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change of Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change of Control.
