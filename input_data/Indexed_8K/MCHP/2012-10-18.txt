EXHIBIT 99.1
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and statements of operations are presented to give effect to the acquisition of Standard Microsystems Corporation (Target) by Microchip Technology Incorporated (Company). The pro forma information was prepared based on the historical financial statements and related notes of the Company and Target (which are incorporated by reference in this document), as adjusted for the pro forma impact of applying the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (US GAAP). The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The allocation of the purchase price of the Target acquisition reflected in these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements has been based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma adjustments are therefore preliminary and have been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the acquisition.  
The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the transaction as of June 30, 2012. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations combine the results of operations of the Company and Target for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and the three months ended June 30, 2012 as if the transaction had occurred on April 1, 2011.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been achieved had the Company and Target been a combined company during the respective periods presented. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 filed on May 30, 2012 and in its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012 filed on August 9, 2012 as well as Targets historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012 filed on April 23, 2012 and in its Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2012 filed on July 3, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements were prepared using the purchase method of accounting with the Company treated as the acquiring entity. Accordingly, the aggregate value of the consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Target based upon their estimated fair values on the closing date of the acquisition. As of the date of this Form 8-K/A, the Company has not completed the detailed valuations necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Target and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has the Company identified all adjustments necessary to conform Targets accounting policies to the Companys accounting policies. Additionally, a final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Target will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Target that existed as of the closing date. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price adjustments presented herein are preliminary, and may not reflect any final purchase price adjustments made. These pro forma purchase price adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements required pursuant to Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.  The Company estimated the fair value of Targets assets and liabilities based on discussions with Targets management, due diligence and preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists. As the final valuations are being performed, increases or decreases in the fair value of relevant balance sheet amounts will result in adjustments, which may result in material differences from the information presented herein.
The
Company expects to incur costs and realize benefits associated with integrating the operations of the Company and Target.  The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or any benefits that may result from operating efficiencies or revenue synergies.
