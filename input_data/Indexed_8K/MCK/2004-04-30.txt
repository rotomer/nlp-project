ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS. (c) Exhibits 99. Recast Condensed Consolidated Operating Information by Business Segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2004 ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. McKesson Corporation (the "Company") today is providing to investors quarterly Recast Condensed Consolidated Operating Information by Business Segment for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2004. This information was already provided on an annual basis by the Company on April 29, 2004 in the Press Tables which accompanied its Earnings Release for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004, filed yesterday on Form 8-K. For any person that requests it, the Company typically distributes in electronic format its earnings release and accompanying press tables, both of which are concurrently posted on its website. Yesterday, in making certain of its electronic distributions, the Company included an Excel spreadsheet containing certain data that was both irrelevant and erroneous. Specifically, Table VI of the Excel spreadsheet inadvertently contained a factually incorrect, un-reviewed set of columns labeled "OPEN: FY05 Pro Forma Budget." The numbers in these columns do not represent the Company's final plan from which we provided our Fiscal 2005 earnings per share guidance of $2.20 to $2.35. This guidance is supported by the Company's approved Fiscal 2005 plan. The set of columns labeled "OPEN: FY05 Pro Forma Budget" had been keyed into the spreadsheet merely as a placeholder, and was never updated or reviewed. Table VI of the Excel spreadsheet also included quarterly recast segment data for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2004 that is correct. The Company already provided this data on an annual basis in its Press Tables filed yesterday, and the quarterly data is now being filed as Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K. 2
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. McKesson Corporation Date: April 30, 2004 By: /s/ Jeffrey C. Campbell ----------------------------------- Jeffrey C. Campbell Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 3
