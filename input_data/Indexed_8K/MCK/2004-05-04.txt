Employment Litigation Verdict
On May 3, 2004, a Yolo County, California jury rendered a $15 million punitive damages verdict against McKesson Corporation (the "Company") in an employment action entitled , (Action No. CV 01-573). The punitive damages verdict followed the same jury's April 30, 2004, award of $3.5 million in compensatory damages against the Company on plaintiff's claims of wrongful termination, disability discrimination and harassment. An additional $500,000 was awarded against an employee of the Company. The Company believes that these verdicts are not supported by the facts or the law and intends to vigorously pursue all available options to reverse or reduce these verdicts, including appeal, if necessary.
