If such amount required to be paid by any Canadian Participant pursuant to this Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) is not in fact made available to the Canadian Administrative Agent within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such Canadian Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum equal to the rate applicable thereto in accordance with the preceding sentence plus the Applicable Rate. A certificate of the Canadian Administrative Agent submitted to any Canadian Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In the event the Canadian Administrative Agent receives a payment with respect to any Canadian Loan in which Canadian Participations have been purchased and as to which the purchase price has been requested by the Canadian Administrative Agent and delivered by a Canadian Participant as in this Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) provided, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Canadian Participant its share of such payment based on its Canadian Participation. If the Canadian Administrative Agent pays any amount to a Canadian Participant pursuant to this Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received or collected and such related payment is not received or collected by the Canadian Administrative Agent, then such Canadian Participant will promptly on demand by the Canadian Administrative Agent return such amount to the Canadian Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon at such rate as the Canadian Administrative Agent shall determine to be customary between banks for correction of errors. If the Canadian Administrative Agent determines at any time that any amount received or collected by the Canadian Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement
 
is to be returned to McKesson Canada under this Agreement or paid to any other Person or entity pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws, any sharing clause in this Agreement, or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Canadian Participant, and each such Canadian Participant will promptly on demand by the Canadian Administrative Agent repay any portion that the Canadian Administrative Agent shall have distributed to such Canadian Participant, together with interest thereon at such rate, if any, as the Canadian Administrative Agent shall pay to McKesson Canada or such other Person or entity with respect thereto. If any amounts returned to McKesson Canada or reimbursed by a Canadian Participant pursuant to this Section 2.01(b)(ii)(A) are later recovered by the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each Canadian Participant a proportionate share based on such Canadian Participant's Canadian Participation.
     (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that, prior to the Participation Funding Date, all amounts paid or credited by McKesson Canada under this Agreement to a Canadian Lender shall be received by such Canadian Lender (a) for its own benefit and account or (b) as agent for or for the account of an Eligible Assignee that is a Canadian Resident in respect of the Canadian Loans, and not otherwise as agent for or on behalf of any other Person.
     
2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed Loans.
     (a) With respect to Domestic Loans, each Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Company's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Committed Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans. With respect to Canadian Loans, each Borrowing, each conversion of Canadian Loans from one Type to the other and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon McKesson Canada's irrevocable notice to the Canadian Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Canadian Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Canadian Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) one Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Canadian Prime Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Applicable Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Applicable Borrower. Each Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Domestic Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and, in the case of Canadian Loans, in an aggregate minimum amount of Cdn.$5,000,000 or any whole multiple of Cdn.$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.03(c) and 2.04(g), each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Applicable Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of
 
Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the identity of the Borrower and the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the Applicable Currency. If the Applicable Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Applicable Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as appropriate. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Applicable Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, they will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
     (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice for Domestic Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Domestic Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in Section 2.02(a). Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice for Canadian Loans, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Canadian Lender of the amount of its Canadian Pro Rata Share of the applicable Canadian Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrowers, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall notify each Canadian Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Canadian Prime Rate Loans described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Domestic Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 11:00 a.m., and each Canadian Lender will make the amount of its Canadian Loan available to the Canadian Administrative Agent in Canadian Dollars at the Canadian Administrative Agent's Office by 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Applicable Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Applicable Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Applicable Borrower on the books of Bank of America or BA Canada with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Applicable Agent by the Applicable Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by a Borrower, there are unpaid amounts due in respect of Bankers' Acceptances, in the case of McKesson Canada, or L/C Borrowings outstanding, in the case of the Company, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such unpaid amounts and L/C Borrowings, and second, to the Applicable Borrower as provided above.
     (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the
 
existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.
     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Applicable Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. At any time that Canadian Prime Rate Loans are outstanding, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall notify McKesson Canada and the Canadian Lenders of any change in BA Canada's prime lending rate used in determining the Canadian Prime Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
     (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect at any time with respect to Committed Loans.
     (f) The Dollar Equivalent amount of any Borrowing in Canadian Dollars will be determined by the Canadian Administrative Agent for such Borrowing on the Computation Date therefor in accordance with Section 2.16(a) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
     
2.03 Letters of Credit.
     (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.
     (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Company or certain Subsidiaries, and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (2) to honor drafts under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Company; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
     (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
     (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from
 
issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
     (B) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last renewal, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date;
     (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date;
     (D) such Letter of Credit is in an initial amount less than $100,000, in the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $500,000, in the case of a standby Letter of Credit, or is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; provided that the $500,000 minimum amount relating to a standby Letter of Credit shall not be applicable if the Company pays to the L/C Issuer in respect of such Letter of Credit an additional issuance fee in an amount to be agreed between the Company and the L/C Issuer from time to time; or
     (E) a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under Section 2.03(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless (i) the Company shall have Cash Collateralized an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the full amount of such Letter of Credit, provided that the Cash Collateral in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share shall be released to the Company promptly upon request after the effective date of the replacement of such Lender in accordance with Section 11.15, or (ii) the L/C Issuer has otherwise entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Company or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer's risk with respect to such Lender.
     (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the Beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.
     (iv) On and after the Closing Date, the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed for all purposes, including for purposes of the fees and charges to be collected pursuant to this Section 2.03 for periods on and after the Closing Date, and reimbursement of costs and expenses to the extent provided herein, to be Letters of Credit outstanding under this Agreement and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the
 
other Loan Documents, and shall be governed by the applications and agreements pertaining thereto and by this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fees with respect to the initial issuance of the Existing Letters of Credit shall be due hereunder.
     (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.
     (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the Beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such Beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such Beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, the Company shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require.
     (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Company and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter
 
of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
     (iii) If the Company so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer shall issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the Beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued; provided further that the L/C issuer shall not exercise its right to prevent any such renewal unless the L/C Issuer determines that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.
     (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the Beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
     (i) Upon receipt from the Beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Company shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Company fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
 
multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
     (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Company in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.
     (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.
     (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.
     (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Company of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
 
     (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
     (d) Repayment of Participations.
     (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Company or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
     (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
     (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
     (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Company or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such Beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection
 
with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
     (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
     (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or
     (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Company or any Subsidiary.
     The Company shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Company's instructions or other irregularity, the Company will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Company shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
     (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any Beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Company's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the Beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
 
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which the Company proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the Beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.
     (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding or (iii) if, prior to the maturity date thereof, prepayment of a Bankers' Acceptance is required by the provisions of Section 2.04(g)(ii) or 2.04(k), the Company shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations or McKesson Canada shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all Bankers' Acceptances, as applicable. Sections 2.03(a)(ii)(E), 2.04, 2.05 and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, or to the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the applicable Canadian Lenders, as applicable, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Company hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, and McKesson Canada hereby grants to the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. For purposes of this Section 2.03, "Cash Collateral" means the cash and deposit account balances pledged and deposited with or delivered to the Applicable Agent, pursuant to a requirement to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations or Bankers' Acceptances.
     (h) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP, with the exception of Rule 5.09 thereof, shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.
     (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
 
Letter of Credit). Such letter of credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable on the fifth Business Day following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.
     (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Company shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to .125% per annum times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, the Company shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges (including, without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to issuances, amendments, renewals, extensions and any demands for payment), of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.
     (k) Conflict with Issuer Document. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.
     (l) Reports to Administrative Agent. The L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, upon each calendar month end, a report setting forth for such period the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under the Letters of Credit that were outstanding during such month.
     
2.04 Bankers' Acceptances for McKesson Canada.
     (a) Acceptance Commitment.
     (i) Each Canadian Lender severally agrees, on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein: (A) in the case of a Canadian Lender that is able to accept Drafts from McKesson Canada, to create acceptances (each, a "Bankers' Acceptance") by accepting Drafts from McKesson Canada and to purchase such Bankers' Acceptances in accordance with Section 2.04(d); and (B) in the case of a Canadian Lender that has participated all or any part of its interest in the Bankers' Acceptance Facilities to a participant that is able to accept Drafts from McKesson Canada, to arrange for the creation of Bankers' Acceptances by such participant and for the purchase of such Bankers' Acceptances by such participant, to the extent of such participation or assignment, in accordance with Section 2.04(d).
     (ii) Each Drawing shall be in an aggregate Face Amount of not less than Cdn.$5,000,000 and in integral multiples of Cdn.$1,000,000 and shall consist of the
 
creation and purchase of Bankers' Acceptances on the same day, effected or arranged by the Canadian Lenders in accordance with Section 2.04(d), ratably according to their respective Canadian Pro Rata Shares.
     (iii) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Bankers' Acceptance Facility and the Canadian Commitments shall be subject to the following limitations:
     (A) the amount otherwise available for Drawing under the Aggregate Canadian Commitment as of any time of determination shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Total Canadian Outstandings as of such time of determination;
     (B) after any Drawing the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect; and
     (C) after any Drawing the Total Canadian Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments then in effect.
     (b) Drawing Notice.
     (i) Each Drawing shall be made on three Business Days' prior written notice specified in relation to Bankers' Acceptances, given not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time), by McKesson Canada to the Canadian Administrative Agent. Each such notice of a Drawing (a "Drawing Notice") shall be given in substantially the form of Exhibit F annexed hereto or by telephone confirmed promptly in writing, containing the same information as would be contained in a Drawing Notice, and shall specify therein (A) the Drawing Date; (B) the aggregate Face Amount of Drafts to be accepted; and (C) the maturity date for such Drafts. The Canadian Administrative Agent shall give each Canadian Lender prompt notice of such Drawing Notice and of such Canadian Lender's ratable portion of Drafts to be accepted under the Drawing.
     (ii) McKesson Canada shall not request in a Drawing Notice a maturity date for Drafts that would be subsequent to the Maturity Date.
     (iii) Each Drawing Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on McKesson Canada. McKesson Canada shall indemnify each Canadian Lender against any loss or expense incurred by such Canadian Lender as a result of any failure by McKesson Canada to fulfill or honor before the date specified for any Drawing, the applicable conditions set forth in this Section 2.04 or Section 4.02, if the Drawing, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
     (iv) McKesson Canada shall repay, and there shall become due and payable, on the Drawing Date the principal amount of any Canadian Loans which McKesson Canada seeks to convert, if any, in whole or in part, to Bankers' Acceptances on such Drawing Date.
 
     (v) None of the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Canadian Lenders shall incur any liability to McKesson Canada or the Company in acting on the telephonic notice referred to above which the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Canadian Lenders believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of McKesson Canada or for otherwise acting in good faith under this Section 2.04 and upon the acceptance of Drafts pursuant to any such telephonic notice, McKesson Canada shall be liable with respect thereto as provided herein. In the event of a conflict between the Canadian Administrative Agent's record of the applicable terms of any Drawing and such Drawing Notice, the Canadian Administrative Agent's record shall prevail, absent manifest or demonstrable error.
     (c) Form of Bankers' Acceptances.
     (i) Each Draft presented by McKesson Canada shall (A) be dated the date of the Drawing; (B) mature and be payable by McKesson Canada (in common with all other Drafts presented in connection with such Drawing) on a Business Day which occurs no less than 30 days nor more than 180 days after the date thereof, which term shall be specified on the Drawing Notice presented by McKesson Canada in accordance with Section 2.04(b)(1); (C) be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Canadian Administrative Agent; and (D) if such Draft is drawn on a Canadian Lender that is a Member, be payable to the Clearing House.
     (ii) McKesson Canada hereby renounces, and shall not claim, any days of grace for the payment of any Bankers' Acceptances.
     (d) Acceptance and Purchase of Drafts.
     (i) Not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on an applicable Drawing Date, each Canadian Lender shall, as the case may be, (A) complete one or more Drafts dated the date of such Drawing, with the maturity date specified by McKesson Canada in the Drawing Notice, accept such Drafts, and purchase the Bankers' Acceptances thereby created for the Drawing Purchase Price; and (B) arrange for its participant to complete one or more Drafts dated the date of such Drawing, with the maturity date specified by McKesson Canada in the Drawing Notice, to accept such Drafts and to purchase the Bankers' Acceptances thereby created for the Drawing Purchase Price.
     (ii) The failure of any Canadian Lender to accept Drafts or purchase Bankers' Acceptances as part of any Drawing shall not relieve such Canadian Lender of its obligation, if any, to accept Drafts and purchase Bankers' Acceptances hereunder, but a Canadian Lender shall not be responsible for the failure of any other Canadian Lender to accept Drafts or purchase Bankers' Acceptance on the Drawing Date for any Drawing.
     (iii) The parties hereto agree that in the administering of Bankers' Acceptances, each Canadian Lender may avail itself of the debt clearing services offered by the Clearing House and that the procedures set forth in Section 2.04 be deemed amended to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of such debt clearing
 
services. The foregoing sentence applies only to the administration of Bankers' Acceptances by the Canadian Lenders and shall not affect the rights and obligations of McKesson Canada with respect to any Bankers' Acceptance.
     (e) Payment of Drawing Purchase Price.
     (i) Subject to Section 2.04(b)(iv), each Canadian Lender shall, before 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the applicable Drawing Date, pay or cause to be paid, the Drawing Purchase Price in respect of any Bankers' Acceptances which such Canadian Lender has purchased or arranged to have purchased pursuant to Section 2.04(d)(i) by depositing or causing to be deposited such amount to such account maintained by the Canadian Administrative Agent at BA Canada as shall have been notified to such Canadian Lender by the Canadian Administrative Agent, in Canadian Dollars in same day funds. Promptly upon receipt of such funds, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall make such funds available to McKesson Canada in accordance with reasonable instructions provided to the Canadian Administrative Agent by McKesson Canada.
     (ii) Bankers' Acceptances purchased by a Canadian Lender or its participant hereunder may be held by such Canadian Lender or such participant, as the case may be, for its own account until maturity or sold by it at any time prior thereto in any relevant market therefor in Canada, in such Lender's or its participant's sole discretion.
     (f) Effective Discount Rate Determination. Promptly upon request of McKesson Canada, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall provide McKesson Canada an indicative Effective Discount Rate, which rate shall not be binding on the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders for purposes of any Drawing or acceptance of Drafts.
     (g) Payment at Maturity; Cash Collateral.
     (i) McKesson Canada shall pay to the Canadian Administrative Agent, and there shall become due and payable, at 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the maturity date for each Bankers' Acceptance an amount in Canadian Dollars in same day funds equal to the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance. McKesson Canada shall make each payment hereunder in respect of Bankers' Acceptances by deposit of the required funds to the Canadian Administrative Agent at the Canada Administrative Agent's Office. Upon receipt of such payment, the Canadian Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause such payment to be distributed in like funds in payment of Bankers' Acceptances ratably (based on the proportion that the aggregate Face Amount of Bankers' Acceptances held by any Canadian Lender or any participant thereof maturing on the relevant date bears to the aggregate Face Amount of Bankers' Acceptances accepted or held by all Canadian Lenders or any participants or assignees thereof maturing on such date) to Canadian Lenders for their account and for the account of any participant, to the extent of and in accordance with their participation. Such payment to the Canadian Administrative Agent shall satisfy McKesson Canada's obligations under any Bankers' Acceptances to which it relates and each Canadian Lender that has accepted such Bankers' Acceptances shall thereafter be solely responsible for the payment of such Bankers' Acceptances and shall indemnify and hold McKesson Canada harmless against
 
any liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by McKesson Canada as a result of any failure by such Canadian Lender or such participant to pay such Bankers' Acceptance in accordance with its terms.
     (ii) If McKesson Canada fails to pay any Bankers' Acceptance when due, or to convert or renew the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance pursuant to Section 2.04(i), the unpaid amount due and payable in respect thereof shall be converted as of such date, and without any necessity for McKesson Canada to give a Committed Loan Notice in accordance with Section 2.02, to, and thereafter be outstanding as, a Canadian Prime Rate Loan made by, the Canadian Lenders and shall bear interest calculated and payable as provided in Section 2.08. Each Borrower acknowledges, agrees and confirms with the Canadian Lenders that the records of each Canadian Lender in respect of payment of any Bankers' Acceptance by such Canadian Lender shall be binding on McKesson Canada and shall be conclusive evidence (in the absence of manifest error) of a Canadian Prime Rate Loan to an amount owing by McKesson Canada to such Canadian Lender. McKesson Canada further agrees that if an Event of Default or the Maturity Date shall occur prior to the date upon which any one or more Bankers' Acceptances are payable by a Canadian Lender, thereupon, McKesson Canada shall Cash Collateralize the full Face Amounts of all such Bankers' Acceptances as provided in Section 2.03(g), notwithstanding the fact that any such Bankers' Acceptance may be held by such Canadian Lender in its own right at maturity; provided, however, that if for any reason McKesson Canada fails to so Cash Collateralize any Bankers' Acceptance, thereupon McKesson Canada shall be deemed for all purposes to have received a Canadian Prime Rate Loan in an amount equal to the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance and McKesson Canada shall pay interest thereon at the Canadian Prime Rate until repayment thereof in full.
     (h) Presigned Draft Forms.
     (i) To enable the Canadian Lenders to create Bankers' Acceptances or complete Drafts in the manner specified in this Section 2.04, McKesson Canada shall supply each Canadian Lender with such number of Drafts as such Canadian Lender may reasonably request, duly endorsed and executed on behalf of McKesson Canada by any one or more of its authorized officers. Each Canadian Lender shall exercise such care in the custody and safekeeping of Drafts as it would exercise in the custody and safekeeping of similar property owned by it. Each Canadian Lender will, upon request by McKesson Canada, promptly advise McKesson Canada of the number and designations, if any, of the uncompleted Drafts then held by it. The signatures of such officers may be mechanically reproduced in facsimile and Drafts and Bankers' Acceptances bearing such facsimile signatures shall be binding upon McKesson Canada as if they had been manually signed by such officers. Notwithstanding that any of the individuals whose manual or facsimile signature appears on any Draft or Bankers' Acceptance as one of such officers may no longer hold office at the date thereof or at the date of its acceptance by a Canadian Lender or a participant hereunder or at any time thereafter, any Draft or Bankers' Acceptance so signed shall be valid and binding upon McKesson Canada.
 
     (ii) To facilitate the acceptance of Drafts hereunder, McKesson Canada hereby appoints each Canadian Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf, as and when considered necessary by such Canadian Lender in connection with a Drawing, an appropriate number of Drafts in the form prescribed by that Canadian Lender. Any Draft signed by a Canadian Lender as attorney for McKesson Canada, whether signed in handwriting or by the facsimile or mechanical signature of an authorized officer of a Canadian Lender, may be dealt with by the Canadian Administrative Agent or any Canadian Lender to all intents and purposes and shall bind McKesson Canada as if duly signed and issued by McKesson Canada.
     (i) Conversion or Renewal of Bankers' Acceptances. Upon the maturity of a Bankers' Acceptance, McKesson Canada may elect to (A) renew such Bankers' Acceptance, by giving a Drawing Notice in accordance with Section 2.04(b)(i); or (B) have all or a portion of the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan, by giving a Committed Loan Notice in accordance with Section 2.02. If the Bankers' Acceptances to be converted cannot be converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan in an aggregate amount which may be made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, under this Agreement, then the amount which cannot be so converted shall be repaid to the Canadian Administrative Agent for distribution to the Canadian Lenders in accordance with Section 2.04(g) on the date of such conversion.
     (j) Circumstances Making Bankers' Acceptances Unavailable.
     (i) If the Canadian Administrative Agent determines in good faith, which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon McKesson Canada, and notifies McKesson Canada that, by reason of circumstances affecting the money market (A) there is no market for Bankers' Acceptances; or (B) the demand for Bankers' Acceptances is insufficient to allow the sale or trading of the Bankers' Acceptances created and purchased hereunder; then,
     (1) the right of McKesson Canada to request a Drawing shall be suspended until the Canadian Administrative Agent determines that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and the Canadian Administrative Agent so notifies McKesson Canada; and
     (2) any Drawing Notice which is outstanding shall be cancelled and the Drawing requested therein shall not be made.
     (ii) The Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly notify McKesson Canada and the Administrative Agent of the suspension of McKesson Canada's right to request a Drawing and of the termination of any such suspension.
     (k) Prepayments. Except as required by Article VIII, Section 2.05 or Section 2.07, no repayment of a Bankers' Acceptance shall be made by McKesson Canada to a Canadian Lender prior to the maturity date thereof. Any such repayment, made as required by Article VIII, Section 2.05 or Section 2.07, shall be made (unless such repayment has been rescinded or
 
otherwise is required to be returned by such Canadian Lender to McKesson Canada for any reason) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03(g) and Section 2.04(g). Any such payment by McKesson Canada to the Canadian Administrative Agent shall satisfy McKesson Canada's obligations under the Bankers' Acceptance to which it relates and, in the case of a Bankers' Acceptance which has been accepted by a Canadian Lender or its participant, such Canadian Lender or such participant shall thereafter be solely responsible for the payment of such Bankers' Acceptance and shall indemnify and hold McKesson Canada harmless against any liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by McKesson Canada as a result of any failure by such Canadian Lender or such participant to pay such Bankers' Acceptance in accordance with its terms.
     
2.05 Prepayments.
     (a) The Applicable Borrower may, upon notice to the Applicable Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Domestic Loans or Canadian Loans, as the case may be, in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Applicable Agent not later than 9:00 a.m., in the case of a prepayment of Domestic Loans, and 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) in the case of prepayment of Canadian Loans, (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Domestic Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Canadian Loans shall be in a principal amount of Cdn.$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of Cdn.$1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid. The Applicable Agent will promptly notify each Lender or Canadian Lender, as appropriate, of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share or Canadian Pro Rata Share, as appropriate, of such prepayment. If such notice is given by a Borrower, the Applicable Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares or Canadian Pro Rata Shares, as appropriate.
     (b) Subject to Section 2.14, if for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Company shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations and/or McKesson Canada shall immediately prepay Canadian Loans and/or Cash Collateralize Bankers' Acceptances in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations or prepay the Face Amounts of Bankers' Acceptances pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) unless after the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.
     (c) Subject to Section 2.14, if for any reason the Total Canadian Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments then in effect, McKesson Canada shall immediately prepay Canadian Loans and Cash Collateralize Bankers' Acceptances in an
 
aggregate amount equal to such excess, provided that McKesson Canada shall not be required to prepay the Bankers' Acceptances pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless, after prepayment in full of the Canadian Loans, the Total Canadian Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments then in effect.
     The Company may, upon notice to the Applicable Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments or the Aggregate Canadian Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments or the Aggregate Canadian Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Applicable Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. or, in the case of a reduction of the Canadian Commitments, 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (iv) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Canadian Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Canadian Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments, (v) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess, and (vi) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Aggregate Canadian Commitments exceed the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, the Aggregate Canadian Commitments shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments and the Canadian Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Canadian Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Canadian Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments or Aggregate Canadian Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender or the Canadian Commitment of each Canadian Lender, as the case may be, according to its Pro Rata Share or its Canadian Pro Rata Share, as the case may be. All facility and utilization fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.
2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
     
2.07 Repayment of Loans.
     The Applicable Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of its Committed Loans outstanding on such date. McKesson Canada shall repay to the Lenders on the date that it ceases to be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company the aggregate principal amount of its Canadian Loans outstanding on such date.
     
2.08 Interest.
     (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
 
Rate; and (iii) each Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
     (b) If any amount payable by a Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
     In addition to certain fees described in Sections 2.03(i) and (j) and Section 2.04:
2.09 Fees.
     (a) Facility Fee. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility fee on the later of the fifth Business Day following the end of each calendar quarter or the fifth Business Day after the Company has received from the Administrative Agent a notice setting forth the amount of such fee, which shall be equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans, Bankers' Acceptances and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans, Bankers' Acceptances or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV are not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each date specified above following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, through the end of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.
     (b) Utilization Fee. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a utilization fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the Total Outstandings on each day that the Total Outstandings existing on such date exceed 50% of the Aggregate Commitments existing on such day. The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the fifth Business Day following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears. The utilization
 
fee shall accrue at all times as set forth in this Section 2.09(b), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV are not met.
     (c) Other Fees. (i) The Company shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
     (ii) The Borrowers shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
     All computations of interest for Bankers' Acceptances and Drawing Fees, for Canadian Prime Rate Loans and for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.
2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees.
     
2.11 Evidence of Debt.
     (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Applicable Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of either Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of such Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Applicable Agent, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Applicable Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
     (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
     
2.12 Payments Generally.
     (a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Company hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars not later than 12:00 noon on the date specified herein, and all payments by McKesson Canada hereunder shall be made to the Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of the Canadian Lenders at the Canadian Administrative Agent's Office in Canadian Dollars not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the date specified herein, in each case, in immediately available funds. The Applicable Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share and to each Canadian Lender its Canadian Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by an Agent after the applicable time specified in this Section 2.12(a) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by a Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b) (i) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to such Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, such Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then such Lender and the Applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (1)(x), in respect of Domestic Loans, the Federal Funds Rate and (y) in respect of Canadian Loans, the Overnight Canadian Rate from time to time in effect and (2) a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If the Applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Applicable Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Applicable Agent shall promptly remit to the Applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Applicable Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Applicable Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Applicable Agent.
(ii) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Agent for the account of
 
the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that the Applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at the greater of (1)(x), in respect of Domestic Loans, the Federal Funds Rate and (y) in respect of Canadian Loans, the Overnight Canadian Rate from time to time in effect and (2) a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
     A notice of the Applicable Agent to any Lender or the Applicable Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
     (c) If any Lender makes available to either Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Applicable Borrower by the Applicable Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, such Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
     (d) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to purchase Bankers' Acceptances and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation, to make any such purchase or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, fund its participation or purchase its Bankers' Acceptance.
     (e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
     If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, the Bankers' Acceptance Facility or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed Loans made by them or Bankers' Acceptances and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans, Bankers' Acceptances or such participations, as the case may be, pro
2.13 Sharing of Payments.
 
rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon; provided further that, for purposes of this Section 2.13, and subject to Section 2.01(b)(ii), no Lender other than a Canadian Lender that is a Canadian Resident may purchase any portion of or any interest in a Canadian Loan or Bankers' Acceptance. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 11.08) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.
     
2.14 Currency Exchange Fluctuations.
     Subject to Section 3.02, if on any Computation Date the Administrative Agent or the Canadian Administrative Agent shall have determined that (a) the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments by more than $3,000,000, or (b) the Total Canadian Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments by more than $3,000,000, in either event due to a change in applicable rates of exchange between Dollars and Canadian Dollars, then the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrowers that a prepayment is required under this Section 2.14, and the Borrowers agree thereupon to make prepayments of Loans such that, after giving effect to such prepayment, the Total Outstandings do not exceed the Aggregate Commitments and the Total Canadian Outstandings do not exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments. No prepayment of Loans is required pursuant to this Section 2.14 or Section 2.05 in the event that the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments by $3,000,000 or less, or the Total Canadian Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Canadian Commitments by $3,000,000 or less, in either event solely due to a change in applicable rates of exchange between Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
     
2.15 Increase in Commitments.
     (a) Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Company may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $200,000,000. At the time of sending such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to
 
respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.15(a), during the first 90 days following the Closing Date, the Company may invite Eligible Assignees to become Lenders under this Agreement in connection with a requested increase without first providing any Lender with the opportunity to increase its Commitment as provided above.
     (b) If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.15, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Company, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that, for purposes of this Section 2.15, (1) the representation and warranty contained in Section 5.08(a) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) and (b), respectively, and (2) the reference to the Closing Date in Section 5.05(b) and Section 5.08(b) shall be deemed to refer to the Increase Effective Date and (B) no Default exists. The Company shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section 2.15.
     (c) In the event of an increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.15, the provisions of this Section 2.15 shall govern any conflicts with provisions in Sections 2.13 or 11.01.
     
2.16 Utilization of Commitments in Canadian Dollars.
     (a) The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent amount with respect to any (i) Bankers' Acceptance or Borrowing comprised of Canadian Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans as of the date which is three Business Days prior to the date of the requested Borrowing, (ii) Borrowing comprised of Canadian Prime Rate Loans, one day prior to the requested date of Borrowing, (iii) outstanding Canadian Loans or Bankers' Acceptances as of the last Business Day of each month, and (iv) conversions to or continuation of Canadian Loans
 
as of the date the related Committed Loan Notice is received by the Canadian Administrative Agent or, if such conversion or continuation is performed in accordance with Section 2.16(b) or Section 3.02, as of, in the case of Section 2.16(b), the date that the request by the Required Lenders is received by the Administrative Agent or, in the case of Section 3.02, the date that the notice by the Administrative Agent is received by the Borrowers and the Lenders (each such date under clauses (i) through (iv) a "Computation Date").
     (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, upon the request of the Required Lenders, all or any part of any outstanding Canadian Loans consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted into Canadian Prime Rate Loans with effect from the last day of the Interest Period with respect to any such Canadian Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers of any such conversion request.
     
3.01 Taxes.
     (a) Any and all payments by the Borrowers to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, taxable income, taxable capital or similar measure and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a lending office or carries on business through a permanent establishment (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrowers shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Applicable Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the Applicable Borrower shall furnish to the Applicable Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
     (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
 
     (c) If a Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to either Agent or any Lender, that Borrower shall also pay to such Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such Agent or such Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that such Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.
     (d) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid by such Agent and such Lender, (ii) amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this Section 3.01(d) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Applicable Agent makes a demand therefor.
     (e) If any Lender or Agent, as applicable, receives a refund (whether by way of a direct payment or by offset) of any Taxes or Other Taxes paid by a Borrower under this Section 3.01 which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is allocable to such payment, the amount of such refund (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or Agent) shall be paid to such Borrower if (i) payment of the Taxes or Other Taxes being refunded has been made in full as and when required pursuant to this Section 3.01 and (ii) such Borrower agrees in writing to repay the amount of such refund, together with interest thereon, to the applicable Lender or Agent in the event such Lender or Agent is required to repay such refund to the Governmental Authority that imposed the Tax or Other Tax being refunded.
     
3.02 Illegality.
     (a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans (whether payable in Dollars or Canadian Dollars), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Applicable Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as the case may be, to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Applicable Agent and the Applicable Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Applicable Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as the case may be, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in
 
the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
     (b) Upon any Lender's giving notice and suspending its obligations relating to Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with Section 3.02(a), the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.15.
     If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders (including Canadian Lenders) to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as the case may be, in the amount specified therein.
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.
     
3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.
     (a) If any Lender, including any Canadian Lender, determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, in either case after the Closing Date, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans, agreeing to accept or accepting, funding or maintaining Drafts or Bankers' Acceptances, or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent, if applicable), the Applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to receive additional amounts with respect to any period prior to six months prior to making such demand.
     (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in either case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time
 
upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to receive additional amounts with respect to any period prior to six months prior to making such demand.
     Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
3.05 Funding Losses.
     (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
     (b) any failure by a Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower; or
     (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 11.15;
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
     
3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.
     (a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
     (b) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or if any Borrower is required to pay amounts to any Lender under Section 3.01 as a result of any Taxes or Other Taxes, in each case the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.15.
 
     All of the Borrowers' obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

     (c) Unless waived by the Administrative Agent, the Company shall have paid all Attorney Costs of the Administrative Agent to the extent invoiced prior to or on the Closing Date, plus such additional amounts of Attorney Costs as shall constitute its reasonable estimate of Attorney Costs incurred or to be incurred by it through the closing proceedings (provided that such estimate shall not thereafter preclude a final settling of accounts between the Company and the Administrative Agent).
     (d) The Closing Date shall have occurred on or before September 27, 2004.
     Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 9.05, for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.
     The obligation of each Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Committed Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Committed Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) is subject to the following conditions precedent:
4.02 Conditions to all Credit Extensions.
     (a) The representations and warranties of each Borrower contained in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.08(a) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant Sections 6.01(a) and (b), respectively.

     Each Borrower represents and warrants (which representations and warranties in the case of McKesson Canada shall be limited to McKesson Canada and its Subsidiaries and other facts and circumstances known to McKesson Canada and its Subsidiaries) to the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and each Lender that:
     The Company and each of its Subsidiaries:
5.01 Corporate Existence and Power.
     (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization;

     The execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower of this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which such Borrower is party, and any Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not and will not:
5.02 Corporate Authorization; No Contravention.
     (a) contravene the terms of any Borrower's Organization Documents;
     (b) conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which any Borrower is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any Governmental Authority to which any Borrower or its property is subject; or
     (c) violate any Requirement of Law.
     No approval, consent, exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement against, any Borrower of the Agreement or any other Loan Document.
5.03 Governmental Authorization.
 
     This Agreement and each other Loan Document to which each Borrower is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.
5.04 Binding Effect.

     Except as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, each as filed with the SEC (including but not limited to the Disclosed Matters), there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the best knowledge of each Borrower, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in arbitration or before any Governmental Authority, against the Company, or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties which:
     (a) purport to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; or
     (b) if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect as of the Closing Date. No injunction, writ, temporary restraining order or any order of any nature has been issued by any court or other Governmental Authority purporting to enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or directing that the transactions provided for herein or therein not be consummated as herein or therein provided.
     No Default or Event of Default exists or would result from the incurring of any Obligations by any Borrower. As of the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect which, individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect as of the Closing Date, or that would, if such default had occurred after the Closing Date, create an Event of Default under Section 8.01(e).
5.06 No Default.
     The proceeds of the Loans are to be used solely for the purposes set forth in Section 6.10. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is generally engaged in the business of purchasing or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

     (b) As of the Closing Date, since March 31, 2004, there has been no Material Adverse Effect.
     None of the Company, any Person controlling the Company, or any Subsidiary, is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither Borrower is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, any state public utilities code, or any other Federal, state or other statute or regulation limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness.
5.09 Regulated Entities.

     As of the Closing Date, based on information available to the Company on the Closing Date, it is unlikely that, prior to the Maturity Date, any actions, suits, proceedings or governmental investigations, pending or threatened, comprising or resulting from the Disclosed Matters would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under any Loan Document.

     Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;
 
     Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, in each case ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them;
     Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, and to the Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Canadian Lenders, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit and that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Bankers' Acceptances; and
     Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Applicable Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit or the unmatured Bankers' Acceptances pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur and Bankers' Acceptances as they mature. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired and all Bankers' Acceptances have been paid, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.
     
9.01 Appointment and Authorization of Agents.
     (a) Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent, and each Canadian Lender hereby irrevocably appoints BA Canada to act on its behalf as the Canadian Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions other than the provisions of Section 9.06 relating to the Company's consultation and notice rights.
     (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall either Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against either Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
 
     (c) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Article IX and under Section 11.04 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer, or any other Indemnified Liabilities of the L/C Issuer, arising out of or in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Article IX and in the definition of "Related Parties" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions or other Indemnified Liabilities, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.
     The Person serving as the Administrative Agent and the Person serving as Canadian Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender (and, as applicable, in its capacity as a Canadian Lender as any other Canadian Lender) and may exercise the same as though it were not such Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" (and, as applicable, the term "Canadian Lender" or "Canadian Lenders") shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Person serving as the Canadian Administrative Agent hereunder in their respective individual capacities. Each such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Persons were not Agents hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
9.02 Rights as a Lender.
     Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Agent:
9.03 Exculpatory Provisions.
     (a) shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
     (b) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that neither Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and
     (c) shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
     Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
 
circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to such Agent by a Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.
     Neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
     Each Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of the duties of such Agent and exercise the rights and powers of such Agent by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agents and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent and Canadian Administrative Agent.
9.04 Delegation of Duties.
     Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.05 Reliance by Agents.
     Either Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor, which, in the case of the Administrative Agent, shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States and, in the case of the Canadian Administrative Agent, shall be a bank with an office in Canada, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in Canada. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by
9.06 Successor Agents.
 
the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (if applicable) appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Applicable Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent or Canadian Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent or Canadian Administrative Agent, as applicable, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's or Canadian Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as such Agent.
     Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
9.07 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan, Bankers' Acceptance or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
9.08 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.
     (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative
 
Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
     (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.
     Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
     None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.
9.09 Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers.
     The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranties, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.  362(a)). The term "Guarantied Obligations" is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and includes:
10.01 Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations.
     (a) any and all Obligations of McKesson Canada now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes and Drafts issued by McKesson Canada and the other Loan Documents, including those arising under successive
 
borrowing transactions under this Agreement which shall either continue the Obligations of McKesson Canada or from time to time renew them after they have been satisfied; and
     (b) those expenses set forth in Section 10.08.
     The Company agrees that its obligations under this Company Guaranty are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the Company agrees as follows:
10.02 Liability of the Company Absolute.
     (a) This Company Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectibility.
     (b) The Administrative Agent may enforce this Company Guaranty upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between Lenders and any Borrower with respect to the existence of such Event of Default.
     (c) The obligations of the Company under this Company Guaranty are independent of the obligations of McKesson Canada under the Loan Documents and the obligations of any other guarantor of the obligations of McKesson Canada under the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Company whether or not any action is brought against McKesson Canada or any of such other guarantors and whether or not McKesson Canada is joined in any such action or actions.
     (d) The Company's payment of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge the Company's liability for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce the Company's covenant to pay a portion of the Guarantied Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release the Company from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guarantied Obligations that is not the subject of such suit.
     (e) Any Agent or any Lender, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability of this Company Guaranty or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of the Company's liability under this Company Guaranty, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guarantied Obligations, (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations and take and hold security for the payment of this Company Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of
 
the Guarantied Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guarantied Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of the Agents or any Lender in respect of this Company Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that the Agents or the Lenders, or any of them, may have against any such security, as the Administrative Agent in its discretion may determine consistent with this Agreement and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Company against McKesson Canada or any security for the Guarantied Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Loan Documents. This Section 10.02(e) shall not modify Section 11.01.
     (f) This Company Guaranty and the obligations of the Company hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations), including without limitation the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not the Company shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Loan Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guarantied Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including without limitation provisions relating to events of default) of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for the Guarantied Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or such Loan Document or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guarantied Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Loan Documents or from the proceeds of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations, even though the Agents or the Lenders, or any of them, might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guarantied Obligations; (v) any Lender's or Agent's consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Guarantied Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any collateral which secures any of the Guarantied Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which McKesson Canada may allege or assert against any Agent or any Lender in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, including but not limited to failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company as an obligor in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.
 
     The Company hereby waives with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agents:
10.03 Waivers by the Company.
     (a) any right to require any Agent or any Lender, as a condition of payment or performance by the Company, to (i) proceed against McKesson Canada, any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from McKesson Canada, any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or any Lender in favor of McKesson Canada or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Agent or any Lender whatsoever;
     (b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of McKesson Canada including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of McKesson Canada from any cause other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations;
     (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal;
     (d) any defense based upon any Agent's or any Lender's errors or omissions in the administration of the Guarantied Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith;
     (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Guaranty and any legal or equitable discharge of the Company's obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Company's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto;
     (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this Guaranty, notices of default under this Agreement or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to McKesson Canada and notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 10.02 and any right to consent to any thereof; and
     (g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Company Guaranty, including without limitation, in accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code, the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 2787-2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433.
     The Company hereby agrees, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the
10.04 Payment by the Company; Application of Payments.
 
Administrative Agent or any other Person may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of McKesson Canada to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.  362(a)), the Company will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders holding the Guarantied Obligations, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guarantied Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (including, without limitation, interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to McKesson Canada, would have accrued on such Guarantied Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against McKesson Canada for such interest in any such bankruptcy proceeding) and all other Guarantied Obligations then owed to the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders as aforesaid. All such payments shall be applied promptly from time to time by the Administrative Agent:
     First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of any collection or other realization under this Company Guaranty, including reasonable compensation to the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith;
     Second, to the payment of all other Guarantied Obligations to each Lender holding Guarantied Obligations its applicable share as provided in this Agreement; and
     Third, after payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations, to the payment to the Company, or its successors or assigns, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining from such payments.
     Until the Guarantied Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated, the Company shall withhold exercise of (a) any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, the Company now has or may hereafter have against McKesson Canada or any of its assets in connection with this Company Guaranty or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute (including without limitation under California Civil Code Section 2847, 2848 or 2849), under common law or otherwise and including without limitation (i) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that the Company now has or may hereafter have against McKesson Canada, (ii) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Agent or any Lender now has or may hereafter have against McKesson Canada, and (iii) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Agent or any Lender, and (b) any right of contribution the Company may have against any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations (including without limitation any such right of contribution under California Civil Code Section 2848). The Company further agrees that, to the extent the agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification the Company may have against McKesson Canada or against any collateral or
10.05 Guarantor's Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, Etc.
 
security, and any rights of contribution the Company may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Agent or any Lender may have against McKesson Canada, to all right, title and interest any Agent or any Lender may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Agent or any Lender may have against such other guarantor. Each Agent, on behalf of Lenders, may use, sell or dispose of any item of collateral or security as it sees fit without regard to any subrogation rights the Company may have, and upon any such disposition or sale any rights of subrogation against such collateral the Company may have shall terminate. If any amount shall be paid to the Company on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification rights at any time when all Guarantied Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.
     Any indebtedness of McKesson Canada now or hereafter held by the Company is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantied Obligations, and any such indebtedness of McKesson Canada to the Company collected or received by the Company after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Company under any other provision of this Guaranty.
10.06 Subordination of Other Obligations.
     The Company agrees that, if all or a portion of the Guarantied Obligations or any other guaranty of all or a portion of the Guarantied Obligations are at any time secured by a deed of trust or mortgage covering interests in real property, the Administrative Agent or its designee, in its sole discretion, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of the Company, may foreclose, pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents or otherwise, on any such deed of trust or mortgage and the property described therein by nonjudicial or other sale. Without limiting any of the waivers contained elsewhere herein, the Company hereby waives any defense to liability arising by reason of the exercise by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, or any of them, of any right or remedy contained in any such deed of trust or mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents. The Company waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, even though the election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a Guarantied Obligation, has destroyed the Company's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against McKesson Canada by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.
10.07 Real Property Security.
     The Company agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, on demand, and to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless against liability for, any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this Company Guaranty.
10.08 Expenses.
     This Company Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guarantied Obligations shall have
10.09 Continuing Guaranty; Termination of Guaranty.
 
been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated. The Company hereby irrevocably waives any right (including without limitation any such right arising under California Civil Code Section 2815) to revoke this Company Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guarantied Obligations.
     It is not necessary for any Lender or any Agent to inquire into the capacity or powers of McKesson Canada or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any of them.
10.10 Authority of the Company or McKesson Canada.
     Any extensions of credit may be granted to McKesson Canada or continued from time to time without notice to or authorization from the Company regardless of the financial or other condition of McKesson Canada at the time of any such grant or continuation. No Lender or Agent shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with the Company their assessment, or the Company's assessment, of the financial condition of McKesson Canada. The Company has adequate means to obtain information from McKesson Canada on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of McKesson Canada and its ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, and the Company assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of McKesson Canada and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations. The Company hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Agent or any Lender to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of McKesson Canada now known or hereafter known by any Agent or any Lender.
10.11 Financial Condition of McKesson Canada.
     The rights, powers and remedies given to the Lenders and the Agents by this Company Guaranty are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies given to any Lender and any Agent by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the other Loan Documents or any agreement between the Company and any Lender and/or any Agent or between McKesson Canada and any Lender and/or any Agent. Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay by any Lender or any Agent in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.
10.12 Rights Cumulative.
     (a) So long as any Guarantied Obligations remain outstanding, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceedings of or against McKesson Canada. The obligations of the Company under this Company Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of McKesson Canada or by any defense which McKesson Canada may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
10.13 Bankruptcy; Post-Petition Interest; Reinstatement of Guaranty.
     (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations ceases to accrue by
 
operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guarantied Obligations if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guarantied Obligations because it is the intention of the Company and the Administrative Agent that the Guarantied Obligations which are guarantied by the Company pursuant to this Guaranty should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve McKesson Canada of any portion of such Guarantied Obligations. The Company will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of the Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such proceeding is commenced.
     (c) In the event that all or any portion of the Guarantied Obligations are paid by McKesson Canada, the obligations of the Company hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Agent or any Lender as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guarantied Obligations for all purposes under this Company Guaranty.
     No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Company or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Company or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:
11.01 Amendments, Etc.
     (a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(a) (other than any condition pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(ix)) without the written consent of each Lender;
     (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) or increase or extend the obligation of any Lender to accept Drafts except as permitted by Section 2.15, in each case without the written consent of such Lender;
     (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder (including a decrease in any amount payable in respect of the Bankers' Acceptance Facility) or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
     (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (v) of the second proviso to this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required
 
Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest at the Default Rate;
     (e) change Section 2.13 or Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;
     (f) change any provision of this Section 11.01 or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; or
     (g) release the Company from the Company Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender;
and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Canadian Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Canadian Administrative Agent under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) Section 11.06(h) may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting Lender all or any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (v) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, only in a writing executed by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

The Administrative Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
     Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender's receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the "return receipt requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.

Each other Lender may change its address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer.
     (d) Reliance by Agents and Lenders. Each Agent and Lender shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Drawing Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Company or McKesson Canada which such Agent or Lender believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of the Applicable Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.

liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of such Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other communications with an Agent may be recorded by such Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.
     No failure by any Lender or the Agents to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, (i) to pay or reimburse the Agents for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney Costs, (ii) to pay the L/C Issuer all fees, costs and charges required under Section 2.03(j) and (iii) to pay or reimburse the Agents, the L/C Issuer and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs.

     (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer, each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with (i) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Commitment, Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
 
documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), or related to any Canadian Dollar transactions or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (A) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (B) result from non-tort claims by a Borrower against such Indemnitee that are successful on the merits as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.
     (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrowers for any reason fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Agents (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agents (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agents (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for an Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (b) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).
     (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither Borrower shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect or consequential damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
     (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 20 Business Days after demand therefor.
     (f) The agreements in this Section 11.04 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.
 
     To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower is made to either Agent or any Lender, or either Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by an Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Applicable Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by such Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of Domestic Loans and L/C Credit Extensions, the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (B) in the case of Canadian Loans and Bankers' Acceptance Credit Extensions, the Overnight Canadian Rate from time to time in effect.
11.05 Payments Set Aside.
     
11.06 Successors and Assigns.
     (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.06(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.06(d), (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Sections 11.06(f) and (i), or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.06(h) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 11.06(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
     (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this Section 11.06(b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
 
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption and (except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to its Affiliate) a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.06(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.06(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.06(d).
     (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.
     (d) In addition to sales of Canadian Participations by Canadian Lenders pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(ii), any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or either Borrower or any of the Borrowers' Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have approved the sale of participations to such Person (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) no participations in Canadian Loans or Bankers' Acceptances shall be sold to any Person that is not a Canadian Resident; (iii) such
 
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (iv) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (v) the Borrowers, the Agents, the L/C Issuer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided further that clauses (i) through (v) of the foregoing proviso are not applicable to Canadian Participations. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to Section 11.06(e), the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.06(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.
     (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 11.14 as though it were a Lender.
     (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
     (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
     "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, and (ii) unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) "Eligible Assignee" shall not include either Borrower or any of the Borrowers' Affiliates or Subsidiaries and (ii) in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), no such Lender, Affiliate or Approved Fund shall be an Eligible Assignee for purposes of Canadian Loans or Bankers' Acceptances unless such Person is a Canadian Resident.
     (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an
 
"SPC") the option to provide all or any part of any Committed Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Committed Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Committed Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Committed Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Applicable Agent as is required under Section 2.12(b)(ii); provided further that no such grant to an SPC shall impose Taxes or Other Taxes on either Borrower. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Company under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Committed Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Committed Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Committed Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Committed Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
     (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.06, (a) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (b) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 11.06(i), "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.
     (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Wachovia Bank, National Association assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 11.06(b), Wachovia Bank, National Association may, upon 30 days' notice to the Company and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer
 
hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Wachovia Bank, National Association as L/C Issuer. In the event that each Lender selected by the Company as L/C Issuer declines the appointment, Bank of America shall become the L/C Issuer, without further action by the Company or the Lenders. If Wachovia Bank, National Association resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).
     (k) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

     Each of the Agents, the L/C Issuer and Lenders agrees to maintain, and to cause its Affiliates (including any Related Parties) to maintain, the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, partners, agents and representatives, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Person or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) to the extent reasonably required, in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 11.07, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents; (g) with the consent of the Company; or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.07 or (ii) becomes available to any Agent, the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company; provided, however, that to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, each of the Agents and Lenders agrees to notify the Company prior to (if reasonably practicable) or concurrently with its disclosure of such information to any third party pursuant to clauses (b), (c) and (f). In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and public information about this Agreement to
 
market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section 11.07, "Information" means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to any Agent, the L/C Issuer, or any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party; provided that, in the case of information received from a Loan Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
     In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrowers, any such notice being waived by the Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
11.08 Set-off.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If either Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
11.09 Interest Rate Limitation.
     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
11.10 Counterparts.
 
     This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
11.11 Integration.
     All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by either Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that either Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.
11.12 Survival of Representations and Warranties.
     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
11.13
     Tax Forms. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Company pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify
11.14
 
the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Company make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.
     (ii) Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.
     (iii) The Company shall not be required to pay any additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.14(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.14(a); provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.14(a) on the date such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 11.14(a) shall relieve the Company of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of any subsequent change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any subsequent change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.
     (iv) The Administrative Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Company is not required to pay additional amounts under this Section 11.14(a).
     (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the
 
Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.
     (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.14, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section 11.14 shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.
     (d) Each Canadian Lender hereby represents and warrants that it is a Canadian Resident, and each Canadian Lender agrees that if the foregoing representation is inaccurate with respect to such Canadian Lender in any material respect, then the Applicable Borrower shall not be required to pay to such Canadian Lender any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 relating to any Taxes resulting solely from such inaccuracy. If a Borrower is required to pay amounts to any Canadian Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 (whether by reason of such Canadian Lender's change of status or otherwise), then such Canadian Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to take such actions as are necessary to minimize such Borrower's obligations under Article III, if such actions, in the sole judgment of such Canadian Lender, are not otherwise disadvantageous to such Canadian Lender.
     
11.15 Replacement of Lenders.
     Under any circumstances set forth herein providing that the Company shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Agreement, or if the Administrative Agent and the Company have mutually determined that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, in either case the Company may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Company in such instance) pursuant to Section 11.06(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees procured by the Company; provided, however, that if the Company elects to exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.06(b), it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04; and provided further that:
     (a) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts);
 
     (b) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
     (c) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
     A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
     
11.16 Governing Law.
     (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATEPROVIDED THAT THE AGENTS, THE L/C ISSUER AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.
