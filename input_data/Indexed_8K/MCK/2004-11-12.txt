Item 8.01. Other Events.
Under agreements reached with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ("OIG"), the previously disclosed industry-wide investigation by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois involving the marketing, sale and reimbursement of enteral products has been resolved as to the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the agreements, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, TBC Products, Inc., has agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois to charges that it attempted to obstruct a federal audit, will pay a fine and a civil settlement totaling $7.4 million, and will be excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal programs. In addition, a Company subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Minnesota Inc., and the OIG will enter into a five year Corporate Integrity Agreement. These agreements close this matter for all McKesson companies. The Compa ny fully reserved the $7.4 million payment during its second fiscal quarter. The resolution of this matter will have no material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company, and is not expected to affect the Company's ongoing business with any customers, including the federal government.
