These changes are intended to keep the directors' compensation competitive, and also to better align their compensation structure with that of the management compensation structure. Other elements of directors' compensation remain unchanged. Separately the Board of Directors also approved Director Stoc k Ownership Guidelines of three times the annual retainer amount and three years in which to satisfy the guidelines.
