Item 8.01 Other Events
By order dated May 20, 2005 and received by the Company on May 25, 2005, Judge Ronald M. Whyte denied "without prejudice" preliminary approval of the previously announced proposed settlement of the consolidated class action pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The order expressed the court's objection to two non-monetary provisions of the settlement. The Company is working with Lead Plaintiff in the action in an effort to fully address and resolve the court's objections.

In re McKESSON HBOC, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION
NO. C-99-20743 RMW And Related Cases
ORDER DENYING PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT
[Re Docket No. 1230]
     As set forth below, the court denies without prejudice approval of the proposed class action settlement between Lead Plaintiff, McKesson and HBOC. The court will issue an order on its return further detailing its reasoning, however, due to its scheduled unavailability, it wanted to alert the parties as to its major concerns with the Revised Proposed Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal.
     First, the PSLRA does seem to occupy the field with respect to the judgment reduction formula and does not provide for a per claim determination of liability. Rather, the PSLRA provision appears to require a determination of overall percentage of fault with respect to all violators of securities law who contributed to plaintiffs loss. 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(f)(3)&(7)(A). Accordingly, the court cannot approve the judgment reduction provision set forth in the Revised Proposed Judgment at paragraph 11.
     Second, it appears that the contribution bar section of the PSLRA, 78u-4(f)(7)(A), is intended to bar contribution claims based a percentage of responsibility of persons contributing to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff and is not intended to bar claims for contractual indemnity. Therefore
id.
ORDER DENYING PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT  C-99-20743 RMW
 
the scope of the proposed bar order set forth in paragraph 9 of the Revised Proposed Judgment appears to exceed that contemplated by the PSLRA.
