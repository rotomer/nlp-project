Item 8.01 Other Events.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, we described an agreement we reached to settle the previously-reported action in the Northern District of California captioned "In re McKesson HBOC,Inc. Securities Litigation" (N.D. Cal. No. C-99-20743 RMW). By order entered September 28, 2005, the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte granted preliminary approval of the settlement and established a schedule for further proceedings, including a hearing date of January 27, 2006 on final approval of the settlement. On September 9, 2005, Judge Whyte granted final approval to the previously-reported agreement to settle all claims brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") on behalf of a class of former participants in the HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan in "In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation" (N.D. Cal. No. C-00-20030 RMW) (the "ERISA Action"). Also on September 9, 2005, Judge Whyte granted in part and denied in part the Company's previously-reported motion to dismiss that portion of the ERISA Action that has not been settled. Judge Whyte dismissed with prejudice all claims brought on behalf of the putative class of participants in the McKesson Profit-Sharing Investment Plan (the "Plan")against the alleged fiduciaries of the Plan, including the Company, except the Court did not dismiss that portion of plaintiffs' claim against the Company alleging that it breached its fiduciary duties under ERISA to the Plan participants by contributing Company stock, as opposed to cash, to the Plan in the Company's annual contribution to the Plan for the Plan fiscal year ended March 31, 1999. The Company has not yet answered the plaintiffs' complaint.
