Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 16, 2005, McKesson Corporation (the "Company") and certain of its present and former directors and officers filed a stipulation of settlement in the Delaware Court of Chancery that provides for settlement of a previously reported derivative action captioned "Saito, et al. v. McCall, et al." (Del. Ch. C.A. No. 17132-NC). Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company's insurance companies will pay $30 million (the "Settlement Consideration") to the Company in exchange for a release of the Company's potential claims against eighteen present or former directors or officers of the Company or HBO & Company, among other terms. Plaintiffs attorney fees, in an amount up to $6 million, will be paid from the Settlement Consideration. The defendants continue to deny vigorously all allegations of wrongdoing or liability with respect to all claims, events and transactions complained of in the actions, but have agreed to the compromise and settlement of the Delaw are action to avoid the burden and expense of continued litigation of the actions. The settlement will also resolve claims asserted in two other derivative actions, one pending in federal court in California, captioned "Cohen v. McCall et al." (N.D. Cal. Case No. 99-20916-RMW) and one pending in state court in California, captioned "Mitchell v. McCall, et al."(Cal. Super. Ct., S.F. County Case No. 304415). The proposed settlement has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, with those directors who are parties to the settlement abstaining from consideration of the matter. The Delaware court has set a hearing for consideration of approval of the settlement on February 21, 2006. In advance of that settlement hearing, the Company will send a notice to shareholders of record that will describe more fully the terms and conditions of the settlement.
