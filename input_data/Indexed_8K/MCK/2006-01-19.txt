Item 8.01 Other Events.
McKesson Corporation (the "Company") today reported that on January 18, 2006, in the previously disclosed action brought against the Company by Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., the Supreme Court for the State and County of New York issued a ruling denying Bear Stearns petition for an injunction which sought to prohibit the Company from performing under its proposed settlement agreement in the consolidated securities class action, In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. C99-20743 RMW (the "Class Action"). Bear Stearns state court action involves allegations that the Companys entry into the settlement of the Class Action, without providing a full release of class plaintiffs claims against Bear Stearns, constitutes a breach of the engagement letter under which Bear Stearns advised the Company in connection with its January 1999 acquisition of HBO & Company. As previously reported by the Company, a final approval hearing for the Class Action settlement will be held on January 27, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
