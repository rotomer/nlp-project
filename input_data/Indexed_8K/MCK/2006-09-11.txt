Item 8.01 Other Events.
McKesson Corporation announced on September 11, 2006 that the company will record a credit to income tax expense of $80 million in its quarter ended September 30th, 2006, based on receiving a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") holding that the companys payment of approximately $960 million to settle the consolidated securities class action, "In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation" (N.D. Cal. Case No. C-99-20743-RMW), is fully tax-deductible. McKesson established tax reserves to reflect the lack of certainty regarding the tax deductibility of settlement amounts paid in the consolidated securities class action and related litigation. The company believes that the IRS ruling makes it appropriate to reverse $80 million of these reserves, resulting in a credit to income tax expense in McKessons financial statements in the quarter ending September 30, 2006. See attached Exhibit 99 for a complete copy of the press release issued September 11, 2006.
