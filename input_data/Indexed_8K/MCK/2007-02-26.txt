Item 8.01 Other Events.
On February 23, 2007, D&K Healthcare Resources LLC, formerly D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc. ("D&K"), a subsidiary of McKesson Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a settlement agreement with class action plaintiffs in the previously disclosed securities class action, Gary Dutton vs. D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc. et al. (Case No. 4-04-CV-00147-SNL), pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the "Court"). Under the terms of the proposed settlement, which will resolve all claims by the D&K shareholders against all defendants, the Company will pay $18.7 million. The Company had previously reserved an estimated liability for this class action in connection with the purchase of D&K in fiscal 2006, and the anticipated adjustment of the reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of the settlement will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. The settlement remains subject to various conditions including, but not limited to, noti ce to the class and preliminary and final approval by the Court. Under the agreement, all defendants deny any violation of law and have agreed to the settlement to eliminate the uncertainities, burden and expense of further protracted litigation.
