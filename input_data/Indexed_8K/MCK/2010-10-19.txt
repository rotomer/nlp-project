On October 15, 2010, McKesson Corporation (the "Company") entered into an agreement to settle an action filed by the State of Connecticut relating to First DataBank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs), for $26 million, which will be shared among the State of Connecticut and the Federal government. The settlement amount is expected to result in an adjustment to the litigation reserves of $24 million, which will drive a corresponding pre-tax charge of $24 million in the Company's second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010.
The settlement with the State of Connecticut, which occurred before trial, includes an express denial of any liability by the Company based on its consistently held position that the Company did not violate any laws in connection with First DataBank's publication of AWPs.
The AWP litigation is described in more detail in the Company's periodic and annual reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2010.
