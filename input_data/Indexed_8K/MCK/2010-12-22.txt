On December 20, 2010, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 applicable to the proposed acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (the "Acquisition") by McKesson Corporation (the "Company").
On December 21, 2010, the Supreme Court of the State of New York entered an Interim Order in the case , Index No. 652124/10 (N.Y. County), which among other things, enjoined and restrained the Company from consummating the Acquisition pending an evidentiary hearing on January 10, 2011. The plaintiffs in this case allege that the Acquisition is in breach of an agreement between the plaintiffs and the Company, and have sought an injunction prohibiting the Acquisition, as well as unspecified damages. The Company believes the Interim Order was granted in error and it intends to immediately appeal this order to allow for the Acquisition to close as soon as possible.
