McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2012 were $30.8 billion, up 3% compared to $30.0 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), first-quarter earnings per diluted share was $1.58 compared to $1.13 a year ago.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 26, 2012 
As previously announced, first-quarter GAAP earnings include an $81 million pre-tax gain on business combination related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in McKesson's corporate headquarters building. This acquisition-related gain is excluded from the company's calculation of Adjusted Earnings. First-quarter GAAP results also include a pre-tax charge of $16 million, recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, to increase an existing litigation reserve for claims against McKesson relating to First DataBank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, commonly referred to as Average Whole Prices ("AWP").
First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $1.55, up 22% compared to $1.27 a year ago.
For the first quarter, McKesson used cash in operations of $552 million, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 billion. During the first quarter the company paid $53 million in dividends, had internal capital spending of $84 million and spent $108 million on acquisitions.
"I am pleased with McKesson's first-quarter financial results," said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our results this quarter represent a solid start to our fiscal year and we continue to expect that McKesson should achieve Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $7.05 to $7.35."
 
Distribution Solutions revenues were up 3% for the first quarter. U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues were up 4% for the first quarter, primarily reflecting market growth and new business with existing customers.
Canadian revenues, on a constant currency basis, decreased 4% for the first quarter primarily due to four fewer sales days. Including the unfavorable currency impact of 4%, Canadian revenues decreased 8% for the first quarter.
Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up 9% for the first quarter, primarily driven by market growth and new customers.
In the first quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $500 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.67%. First-quarter adjusted operating profit was $553 million and the adjusted operating margin was 1.85%.
Technology Solutions revenues were up 4% for the first quarter. GAAP operating profit was $93 million for the first quarter and GAAP operating margin was 11.10%. Adjusted operating profit was $109 million for the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was 13.01%.

McKesson continues to expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $7.05 to $7.35 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, which excludes the following GAAP items:

Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) Financial Information
Adjusted Earnings represents income from continuing operations, excluding the effects of the following items from the Company's GAAP financial results, including the related income tax effects:
 Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions by the Company.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles
 Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, and gains or losses on business combinations.
Acquisition expenses and related adjustments
 Adjustments to the Company's reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable losses for its Average Wholesale Price and Securities Litigation matters, as such terms were defined in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2009.
Litigation reserve adjustments
Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, "Income Taxes," which is the same accounting principles used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.
The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted Earnings provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company's future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted Earnings assists investors' ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Adjusted Earnings measure may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.
The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted Earnings in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
