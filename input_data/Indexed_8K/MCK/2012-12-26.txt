Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In connection with the proposed acquisition (the "Acquisition") by McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "McKesson") of PSS World Medical, Inc. ("PSS World Medical"), on December 21, 2012 the Company entered into a $2.1 billion one-year unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (the "Bridge Loan Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the Lenders party thereto. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Bridge Loan Agreement, up to two borrowings of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.1 billion will be made available to the Company at its request to: (i) pay the merger consideration under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 24, 2012, by and among the Company, Palm Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and PSS World Medical; (ii) repay certain indebtedness of PSS World Medical and its subsidiaries outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition; and (iii) pay transaction costs associated with the Acquisition.
The Bridge Loan Agreement contains terms substantially similar to those contained in the Company's existing revolving credit facility, dated as of September 23, 2011, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2011 as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Similar to the revolving credit facility, borrowing under the Bridge Loan Agreement generally bears interest based upon either a prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate. The Bridge Loan Agreement includes, among other terms and conditions standard for transactions of this type, limitations (subject to specified exclusions) on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens; engage in certain mergers and consolidations; and enter into swap contracts. In addition, the Bridge Loan Agreement requires that the Company maintain a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 56.5% throughout the term of the Bridge Loan Agreement. The Bridge Loan Agreement also includes mandatory prepayment provisions requiring the prepayment of the loans and (if applicable) reductions of undrawn commitments thereunder in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from certain issuances of equity outside the ordinary course of business, certain property loss events, certain asset sales outside the ordinary course of business and the incurrence of certain indebtedness outside the ordinary course of business.
The foregoing description of the Company's Bridge Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the executed copy of the agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company entered into the Bridge Loan Agreement in order to provide funds for its purchase of PSS World Medical prior to the closing of the anticipated permanent financing, and to repay certain indebtedness of PSS World Medical and its subsidiaries. The Company expects that it will refinance all or part of the outstanding amounts under the Bridge Loan Agreement with longer-term debt financing prior to the end of the Bridge Loan Agreement's one-year term.
Certain of the lenders party to the Bridge Loan Agreement and their respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.

Section 2.12(a)
The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars not later than 12:00 noon on the date specified herein in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's
 
Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after the applicable time specified in this shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
Section 2.12(a)
(b)(i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrower agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (1) the Federal Funds Rate and (2) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the related Loan. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
Section 2.02
(ii) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of (1) the Federal Funds Rate and (2) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loan set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

ARTICLE IV
(d) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan.
Section 11.04(c)
(e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans, pro rata with each of them; , , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to ) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

For purposes of any Loan Document, "Excluded Taxes" shall mean, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes (in lieu of net income taxes) and branch profits taxes, in each case, imposed by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains its principal office or lending office or carries on business through a permanent establishment, (ii) in the case of a Lender (other than an assignee pursuant to a request by the Borrower under ), any United States withholding tax imposed on amounts payable to or for the account of such Lender with respect to an applicable interest in a Loan or Commitment pursuant to a law in effect at the time such Lender acquires such interest in the Loan or Commitment or designates a new lending office, except in each case to the extent that amounts with respect to such taxes were payable either to such Lender's assignor immediately before such Lender acquired the applicable interest or to such Lender immediately before it changed its lending office, and (iii) taxes imposed under FATCA. If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes or Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) in the case of Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this ), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, where the payment is by the Borrower, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

documentary taxes and any other similar excise or property taxes or charges or levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
(c) Subject to , each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this ) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, and (ii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

(d) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund (whether by way of a direct payment or by offset) of any Taxes or Other Taxes paid or indemnified by the Borrower under this , it shall pay to the Borrower the amount of such refund (but only to the extent of payments by the Borrower made under this with respect to Taxes giving rise to such refund, and net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and, for the avoidance of doubt, without interest other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) if (i) payment of the Taxes or Other Taxes being refunded has been made in full as and when required pursuant to this and (ii) the Borrower agrees in writing to repay the amount of such refund, together with interest thereon, to the applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to the Governmental Authority that imposed the Tax or Other Tax being refunded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (d), in no event will the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, be required to pay any amount to the Borrower, pursuant to this paragraph (d) the payment of which would place the Lender or the Administrative Agent in a less favorable net after-tax position than it would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Lender or the Administrative Agent to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
 
such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
(b) Upon any Lender's giving notice and suspending its obligations relating to Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with .

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(ii) subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any taxes of any kind whatsoever (other than (A) Taxes imposed on payments under any Loan Document, (B) Other Taxes and (C) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or of maintaining its
