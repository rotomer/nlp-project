To the Stockholders and Members of KMV Corporation and KMV LLC:
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related combined statement of operations, combined statement of stockholders' and members' deficit and combined statement of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KMV Corporation and KMV LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

On April 12, 2002, Moody's Corporation ("Moody's" or the "Company") acquired KMV, a quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all cash transaction for $210.0 million. The acquisition will expand the customer base and product offerings of Moody's credit risk assessment business, which was previously operated by Moody's Risk Management Services. Moody's initially funded the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings of $81 million under its existing bank credit lines. The Company intends to pursue more permanent financing for the acquisition in order to retain open bank credit lines and to use cash flow from operations for share repurchases.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2001, illustrate the effect of the acquisition of KMV as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2002 illustrates the effect of the acquisition of KMV as if it had been consummated on March 31, 2002. All material nonrecurring charges or credits and related tax effects resulting directly from the acquisition have been excluded from the unaudited pro forma financial information. See page 29 for a complete listing of pro forma adjustments and explanations.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price allocation included herein is preliminary, however, management does not believe that the final purchase price allocation will be materially different from the preliminary allocation. No adjustment has been included in the pro forma financial information for any anticipated cost savings or operational synergies.
This unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with: (i) the historical financial statements of KMV (including the notes thereto) contained herein (ii) the historical financial statements of Moody's contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and (iii) the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of Moody's contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002.
This unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of the actual consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position that would have been achieved had the transaction been consummated as of the dates indicated above nor does it purport to indicate results that may be attained in the future.
