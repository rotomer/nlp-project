Exhibit 99.1 Moody's Corporation Reaffirms Outlook for 2006 and Announces New Share Repurchase Authority NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 6, 2006--Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) is hosting its first Investor Day today. Management presentations, which begin at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, will be webcast and can be accessed through Moody's Shareholder Relations Web site, http://ir.moodys.com. In conjunction with this event Moody's is reaffirming its outlook for the full year 2006 and announcing the authorization of a new share repurchase program. Outlook for Full Year 2006 Moody's overall operating outlook for the full year 2006 is unchanged from its guidance provided on April 26, 2006. The company continues to project overall revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit percent range for the full year 2006. Moody's expects the operating margin before the impact of expensing stock-based compensation to decline by up to 100 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments it is continuing to make to expand internationally; improve analytical processes; pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives; introduce new products; and improve its technology infrastructure. For 2006 the company continues to project year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the low double-digit percent range. This growth forecast includes the modest positive impact of expected share repurchase activity. In addition, this forecast excludes the impacts of adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005 and 2006, and the expensing of stock-based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. This year represents the final year of "phasing in" of expense related to stock-based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock-based compensation is expected to be in the range of USD 0.13 - USD 0.15 per diluted share in 2006, compared to USD 0.10 per diluted share in 2005. Board Approves New Share Repurchase Authority Moody's available share repurchase authorization, which stood at USD 654 million at the end of the first quarter of 2006, is approaching completion. On June 5, Moody's Board of Directors authorized a new USD 2 billion share repurchase program. Upon completion of the prior USD 1 billion program, Moody's will begin repurchasing shares under the new program, which does not have an expiration date. As management has previously discussed, the company plans to continue to return capital to shareholders by purchasing shares systematically as well as by purchasing opportunistically when conditions warrant. Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) is the parent company of Moody's Investors Service, a leading provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets, Moody's KMV, a leading provider of credit risk processing and credit risk management products for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets serving the world's largest financial institutions, and Moody's Economy.com, a provider of economic research and data services. The corporation, which reported revenue of USD 1.7 billion in 2005, employs approximately 2,900 people worldwide and maintains offices in 22 countries.
