Exhibit 99.1 Moody's Corporation Reports Results for Second Quarter of 2006 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 2, 2006--Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) today announced results for the second quarter of 2006. Summary of Results for Second Quarter 2006 Moody's reported revenue of $511.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006, an increase of 14% from $446.8 million for the same quarter of 2005. Operating income for the quarter was $289.1 million and rose 14% from $252.8 million for the same period of last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, 26% higher than $0.47 in the second quarter of 2005. Results for the quarter included $20.7 million of expense related to stock options and other stock-based compensation plans, equivalent to $0.04 per diluted share, compared with $12.3 million, or $0.03 per share, in the prior-year period. Raymond McDaniel, Moody's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Moody's results for the second quarter of 2006 showed healthy double-digit revenue growth in most of our major lines of business despite rising interest rates. Based on Moody's strong results for the first half of 2006 we now believe that results for the full year 2006 will modestly exceed our prior forecast." In addition to its reported results, Moody's has included in this earnings release certain adjusted results that the Securities and Exchange Commission defines as "non-GAAP financial measures." Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company's growth. These non-GAAP financial measures relate to: (1) presenting results for the second quarter of 2006 and the first six months of both 2006 and 2005 before adjustments for income tax exposures related to legacy income tax matters that Moody's assumed in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in 2000 and which are described in Moody's annual and quarterly SEC filings; and (2) presenting results for the second quarter of both 2006 and 2005, and the first six months of both 2006 and 2005 before the impact of expensing stock-based compensation, which is being phased in over a four year period for stock awards commencing in 2003. In addition, the 2006 outlook presented below includes a discussion of projected 2006 diluted earnings per share growth excluding the impact of adjustments related to legacy income tax exposures and the impact of expensing stock-based compensation. Attached to this earnings release are tables showing adjustments to Moody's second quarter and first half results for 2006 and 2005 to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impacts noted above. Second Quarter Revenue Revenue at Moody's Investors Service for the second quarter of 2006 was $476.5 million, an increase of 14% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted operating results, mainly due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, reducing revenue growth by approximately 40 basis points and operating income growth by approximately 60 basis points. Ratings revenue totaled $413.6 million in the quarter, rising 14% from a year ago. Research revenue of $62.9 million was 19% higher than in the second quarter of 2005. Within the ratings business, global structured finance revenue totaled $217.8 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 13% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue rose 14%, with very strong growth from rating credit derivatives more than offsetting a year-over-year decline from residential mortgage-backed securities. International structured finance revenue rose 12% benefiting from strength in the asset-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives segments of the business, which more than offset weakness from commercial mortgage-backed securities. Global corporate finance revenue of $107.8 million in the second quarter of 2006 rose 36% from the same quarter of 2005. Revenue in the U.S. rose 39% from the prior year period, reflecting robust growth related to the investment grade, high yield and bank loan segments of the business. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue increased 30% due primarily to strong issuance and growth in new rating relationships in Europe. Global financial institutions and sovereigns revenue totaled $66.9 million for the second quarter of 2006, 2% higher than in the prior year period. Revenue increased 19% in the U.S. but was 11% lower in international markets compared with the prior year period, which benefited from very strong issuance. U.S. public finance revenue was $21.1 million for the second quarter of 2006, 19% lower than in the second quarter of 2005, with an increase in new money issuance more than offset by a sharp decrease in refundings. Moody's global research revenue rose to $62.9 million, increasing 19% from the same quarter of 2005. The quarter's growth reflected higher revenue from selling Moody's narrative credit research, licensing Moody's data to third parties, selling data and analytic tools, and providing credit training. Revenue at Moody's KMV for the second quarter of 2006 was $34.9 million, 16% higher than in the second quarter of 2005, based on growth in subscriptions to risk products, licensing of credit processing software and fees for related software maintenance, and fees for professional services. Moody's U.S. revenue of $328.1 million for the second quarter of 2006 was up 16% from the second quarter of 2005. International revenue of $183.3 million was 11% higher than in the prior year period and included approximately 100 basis points of negative impact from currency translation. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moody's total in the quarter compared with 37% in the year-ago period. Second Quarter Expenses Moody's operating expenses were $222.3 million in the second quarter of 2006, 15% higher than in the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by higher personnel costs and various technology investments. The quarter's stock-based compensation expense was $20.7 million compared with $12.3 million in the 2005 period, reflecting, in part, the phasing-in of stock-based compensation expense begun in 2003. Moody's operating margin for the second quarter of 2006 was 57%, essentially unchanged from the prior year period. Second Quarter Effective Tax Rate Moody's effective tax rate was 40.6% for the second quarter of 2006 compared with 41.6% for the prior year period. The decrease was due in part to a favorable legacy tax adjustment of $1.5 million in the current quarter. Excluding the impact of the above, the tax rate for the second quarter of 2006 was 41.1% compared to 41.6% for the prior year period. Year-to-date Results Revenue for the first six months of 2006 totaled $951.6 million, an increase of 14% from $837.3 million for the same period of 2005. First half operating income of $527.4 million was up 13% from $465.3 million for the same period of 2005. Currency translation had a negative impact on these results, reducing revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points and operating income growth by approximately 110 basis points. Diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2006 were $1.07, 24% higher than the $0.86 for the first half of 2005. Earnings per share for the first half of 2006 included $34.6 million of expense related to stock options and other stock-based compensation plans, or $0.08 per share, compared with $29.2 million of similar expense, or $0.06 per share, for the first half of 2005. Ratings and research revenue at Moody's Investors Service totaled $884.4 million for the first six months of 2006, an increase of 14% from the prior year period. Global ratings revenue was $760.7 million for the first six months of 2006, up 13% from $672.2 million in the same period of 2005. Research revenue rose to $123.7 million for the first half of 2006, up 18% from the first half of 2005. Finally, revenue at Moody's KMV for the first six months of 2006 totaled $67.2 million, 11% higher than in the prior year period. Share Repurchases During the second quarter of 2006, Moody's repurchased 9.7 million shares at a total cost of $574 million, which more than offset less than 1 million shares issued under employee stock compensation plans. Since becoming a public company in October 2000 and through June 30, 2006, Moody's has repurchased 79.2 million shares at a total cost of $2.6 billion, including 36.7 million shares to offset shares issued under employee stock plans. At quarter-end, Moody's had approximately $2.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Assumptions and Outlook for Full Year 2006 Moody's outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity and securitization levels. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ from our current outlook. Based on Moody's stronger than expected results for the first half of 2006 we have made a number of revisions to our outlook for the full year 2006. For Moody's overall, we now project revenue growth in the low double-digit percent range for the full year 2006. This assumes foreign currency translation for the remainder of the year at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. We now expect the operating margin before the impact of expensing stock-based compensation to be flat in 2006 compared with 2005. Among other things, this reflects our increased outlook for revenue and a delay in some expenses related to real estate expansion of our New York headquarters. The margin outlook continues to reflect investments we are making to: expand internationally; improve our analytical processes; pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives; introduce new products; and improve our technology infrastructure. For 2006, we project year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the mid- to high teens percent range. This forecast excludes the impacts of adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005 and 2006, and the expensing of stock-based compensation in 2005 and 2006. This year represents the final year of "phasing in" of expense related to stock-based compensation, which we began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock-based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.15 - $0.17 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., we forecast high single to double-digit percent revenue growth for the Moody's Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, we expect revenue for the year to rise in the mid- to high single-digit percent range from the record level of 2005. We project a mid-teens percent decline in revenue from residential mortgage-backed securities ratings (including home equity securitization), offset by strong year-over-year revenue growth from rating credit derivatives and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens percent range for the year, up from our previous expectation of high single-digit percent growth largely due to higher expected transaction volume in rated bonds and bank loans. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, we expect revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range for the year as new ratings mandates and fee increases partly related to our Enhanced Analysis Initiative should more than offset the impact of lower revenue related to issuance volumes. For the U.S. public finance sector, we expect revenue for 2006 to decline in the double-digit percent range as rising interest rates should continue to slow refinancing activity. We continue to expect strong growth in the U.S. research business at better than twenty percent. Outside the U.S. we still expect ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation will have no material impact on revenue growth for the year. Our outlook assumes mid- to high teens percent growth in international revenue for all major business lines except financial institutions, where we expect international revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Our outlook for Moody's KMV globally anticipates growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. We now expect this will result in high single-digit percent growth in revenue, with greater growth in profitability.
