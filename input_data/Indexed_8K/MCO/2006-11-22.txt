Development Rights

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant hereby expressly and irrevocably waives the right hereafter to execute any declaration of zoning lot restrictions, zoning lot development agreement or similar agreement affecting the Premises or any part thereof, and consents to the recording of any such agreement or agreements against the Premises; provided that, during the term hereof, Landlord shall not record or execute any such agreement, or take any other action which (i) would limit Tenant's rights to use the Premises for the purposes presently permitted under Laws or (ii) would otherwise adversely affect Tenant's
