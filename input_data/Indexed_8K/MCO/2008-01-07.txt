Moody's Corporation (the "Company") previously disclosed in its earnings release for the third quarter of 2007, filed on Form 8-K on October 24, 2007, that it expected to record a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2007. This anticipated charge was initiated in response to the Company's reorganization announced on August 7, 2007 and a decline in current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors. On December 31, 2007, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the "Plan") that it estimates will result in a fourth quarter 2007 pre-tax charge of approximately $47  $52 million.
Included in the Plan is a reduction of staff as a result of: (i) consolidation of certain corporate staff functions, (ii) the integration of businesses comprising Moody's Analytics, and (iii) an anticipated decline in new securities issuance in some market sectors. The Plan also calls for the termination of technology contracts as well as the outsourcing of certain technology functions anticipated to begin in the first half of 2008. The Plan is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2008.
As part of the Plan staff reductions described above, the Company plans to reduce global headcount by approximately 275 positions, 7.5% of the headcount as of September 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the number of full-time equivalent employees of Moody's was approximately 3,600. This is anticipated to result in restructuring charges of approximately $43  $48 million, an amount that includes severance and related costs primarily determined based on an existing severance plan. Additionally, the termination of technology contracts is expected to result in an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $4 million. Cash outlays relating to the headcount reductions and contract termination costs are anticipated to be approximately $40  $45 million and $4 million, respectively, the majority of which will be paid out in 2008.
