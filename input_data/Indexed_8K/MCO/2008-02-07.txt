Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys, commented, Moodys confronted unprecedented challenges in 2007 as credit problems that began in the U.S. housing sector affected important parts of our ratings business globally. Despite these difficult conditions, Moodys reported solid financial performance for 2007 based on very strong performance in the first half of the year. In speaking about 2008, Mr. McDaniel added, The severity and protracted nature of current credit market dislocations confirms that the challenges of 2007 will persist well into 2008. Moodys is responding to these conditions by providing more extensive research and credit evaluation tools. We are also working closely with market participants on information transparency in order to restore confidence and to support more orderly credit market operations as quickly as possible.
Fourth Quarter Revenue
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $460.7 million, 16% lower than the prior year period. Foreign currency translation positively impacted operating results, mainly due to the weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound, increasing revenue and operating income growth by approximately 230 and 160 basis points, respectively.
Ratings revenue totaled $372.6 million in the quarter, a decrease of 23% from a year ago. Growth in revenue from the global financial institutions business was more than offset by declines across all other global ratings businesses.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $164.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of 40% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 53%, driven by significant declines in issuance across most asset categories. International structured finance revenue decreased 17%, led by declines in the European credit derivatives and commercial mortgage-backed securities businesses.
Global corporate finance revenue of $104.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was down slightly with the same quarter of 2006 as growth in relationship-based fees mitigated declines in issuance-based revenue. Revenue in the U.S. rose 2% from the prior year period, reflecting significant growth in revenue from investment-grade bond ratings, partially offset by double-digit revenue declines from rating high yield bonds and leveraged bank loans. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue decreased 7% due primarily to declines in revenue from rating both investment-grade and speculative-grade securities, mainly in Europe.
Global financial institutions and sovereigns revenue totaled $73.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, increasing 6% from the prior year period. Revenue in the U.S. grew 5%, driven mainly by favorable results in the insurance sector. Outside the U.S., revenue rose 6% reflecting good performance in the banking sectors in both Europe and Asia.
U.S. public finance revenue was $29.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, declining 6% from the robust fourth quarter of 2006.
Moodys global research revenue rose to $88.1 million, up 30% from the same quarter of 2006. This growth reflected good increases in each of Moodys research product segments, including credit and economic analysis subscriptions, analytical software and credit training services.
Revenue at Moodys KMV (MKMV) for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $44.2 million, 11% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results were bolstered by strong growth in revenue from the licensing of credit processing software and sales of risk product subscriptions.
On a geographic basis, Moodys U.S. revenue of $277.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased 23% from the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-U.S. revenue of $227.8 million was essentially flat to the prior year period and reflected approximately 530 basis points of positive impact from currency translation. International revenue accounted for 45% of Moodys total revenue in the quarter compared with 39% in the year-ago period.
Fourth Quarter Expenses
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $292.8 million and included a restructuring charge of $47.8 million. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2007 and the gain on a building sale in 2006, Moodys operating expenses were $245.0 million in the fourth quarter, 15% lower than in the prior year period, and $29.5 million or 11% lower than operating expenses in the third quarter of 2007, primarily related to lower incentive compensation expenses. Moodys operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 51%, equal to the margin for the same period in 2006, excluding the restructuring charge in 2007 and gain on sale in 2006.
Fourth Quarter Effective Tax Rate
Moodys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 33.8% as compared with 39.9% for the prior year period. The reduced tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was primarily due to lower state income taxes, including the 2007 reduction of the New York State income tax rate and the benefit from a higher proportion of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.
Full Year 2007 Results
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $2,104.2 million for the full year 2007, an increase of 11% from the prior year period. Currency translation had a positive impact on these results, increasing revenue and operating income growth by approximately 210 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively. Global ratings revenue was $1,779.9 million for the full year 2007, up 9% from $1,639.8 million in the same period of 2006. Each of the global ratings business lines achieved year-over-year revenue growth, led by double-digit growth in corporate finance and financial institutions. Research revenue rose to $324.3 million for the full year 2007, up 27% from the full year 2006. Finally, revenue at MKMV for the full year 2007 totaled $154.8 million, 8% higher than in the prior year period.
Share Repurchases and Capital Structure
During the fourth quarter of 2007, Moodys repurchased 7.7 million shares at a total cost of $311.4 million and issued 0.8 million shares of stock under stock-based compensation plans. For the full year 2007, Moodys repurchased 31.3 million shares at a total cost of $1.7 billion and issued 4.3 million shares under stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2007 totaled 251.4 million, representing a 10% decrease from 278.6 million shares a year earlier. Share repurchases during the year were funded using a combination of free cash flow and borrowings. At year-end, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt with an additional $400 million available. Additionally, as of December 31, 2007, Moodys had $2.0 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program.
Outlook for Full Year 2008
Beginning January 1, 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the business reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the reorganization, the rating agency remains in the Moodys Investors Service (MIS) operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moodys other commercial activities, including Moodys KMV and sales of MIS research, are now combined under a new operating company known as Moodys Analytics. Moodys new initiatives in fixed income pricing and valuations will also be captured within Moodys Analytics. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the end of this press release for further details.
Moodys outlook for 2008 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from our current outlook.
For Moodys overall, full-year 2008 revenue is expected to decline in the low double-digit percent range. This decline assumes foreign currency translation in 2008 at current exchange rates. We anticipate a weak first half of 2008 with improvement in market liquidity and issuance conditions later in the year. Under this scenario, we note that Moodys first half 2008 performance is likely to reflect unusually weak market conditions, as well as challenging year-on-year comparisons against the first half of 2007 when Moodys delivered record performance. Excluding the 2007 restructuring charge, we expect the full-year 2008 operating margin to decline to the mid- to high-forties percent range, due primarily to lower ratings revenue. Full-year expenses are expected to be about flat to full year 2007, excluding the restructuring charge, as the annualized impact of new hires added in the first half of 2007 and investments we continue to make in the growing areas of our business will be offset by savings from our restructuring actions. Earnings per share for 2008 are projected in a range from $2.17 to $2.25.
For the global Moodys Investors Service business, we expect revenue for the full year 2008 to decline in the mid-to high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., we project Moodys Investors Service revenue to decrease in the mid-twenties percent range for the full year 2008.
In the U.S. structured finance business, we expect revenue for the year to decline in the low- to mid-forties percent range, reflecting double-digit percent declines in most asset classes, led by residential mortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives ratings.
In the U.S. corporate finance business, we expect revenue to decrease in the low-teens percent range for the year driven by declines across all asset classes.
In both the U.S. financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance sectors, we project revenue in 2008 to grow in the low single-digit percent range.
Outside the U.S. we expect Moodys Investors Service revenue to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. Good growth from rating financial institutions; public, project and infrastructure finance; and corporate securities is expected to be more than offset by a decline in structured finance ratings revenue, primarily in Europe.
For Moodys Analytics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range. In the U.S., growth is projected to be in the low-teens percent range while outside the U.S., revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Growth in the subscription businesses is expected in the mid-teens range, reflecting continued demand for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics, and the impact of our newly formed pricing and valuation business. In the consulting business, we anticipate very strong growth, reflecting a robust pipeline of professional services engagements and credit training projects. There is considerable demand for Moodys expertise in credit education, risk modeling, and scorecard development as customers implement more sophisticated risk management processes and comply with regulatory requirements. In the software business, we expect revenue to be flat versus 2007, as customers begin to migrate to new generation software platforms.
