The Company has guaranteed the obligations of Moody's Investors Service Limited under the foregoing agreements and will be a party to the leases eventually granted pursuant to those agreements.
Rent payments under the Leases will commence March 31, 2011 and represent quarterly payments in advance. The annual base rent for the Storage Agreement for Lease is currently not known but is not expected to be material. The annual base rent during the initial term of the Agreement for Lease assuming the maximum allowable rent increases at each five year rent review date will be as follows:
 
In addition to the base rent payments, MIS UK will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The Agreement and Storage Agreement for Lease contain customary operating lease provisions. MIS UK will also incur costs to build out the floors to its specifications.
