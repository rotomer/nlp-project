(a) Former independent registered public accounting firm
On February 28, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Moody's Corporation (the "Company") approved the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors to dismiss PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and the Profit Participation Plan of Moody's Corporation (the "Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, respectively.
The reports of PwC on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for the Company and during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Plan, and through February 28, 2008 for both the Company and the Plan, there have been no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements of the Company and the Plan for such years. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for the Company and during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Plan, and through February 28, 2008 for both the Company and the Plan, there have been no "reportable events" as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The Company has provided PwC with a copy of the above disclosures and requested that PwC furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of PwC's letter, dated March 5, 2008 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
(b) New independent registered public accounting firm
On February 28, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors to appoint KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and the Plan for the year ending December 31, 2008 and for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively. The decision to select KPMG was the result of a competitive process conducted by the Company in the ordinary course of business.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for the Company and during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Plan, and through February 28, 2008 for both the Company and the Plan, KPMG was not consulted by the Company or the Plan regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to any completed or proposed transaction, (2) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's or the Plan's financial statements for such years, or (3) any other accounting, auditing, or financial reporting matter described in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
