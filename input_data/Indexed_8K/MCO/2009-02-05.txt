Summary of Results for Fourth Quarter 2008
Moodys reported revenue of $403.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of 20% from $504.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating income for the quarter was $125.4 million, a 41% decline from $212.1 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.37 for the fourth quarter of 2008, and included $0.04 of dilution relating to the acquisition of Fermat International (Fermat) which closed in October 2008. Excluding restructuring charges in 2007, diluted earnings per share declined 38% to $0.37 for the fourth quarter of 2008 versus $0.60 in the prior-year period.
Summary of Results for Full-Year 2008
Moodys Corporation revenue for the full-year 2008 totaled $1,755.4 million, a decrease of 22% from $2,259.0 million for the same period of 2007. Operating income of $748.2 million was down 34% from $1,131.0 million for the full-year 2007. Excluding the positive impact from foreign currency translation, global revenue and operating income declined 23% and 36%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $1.87 for the full-year 2008 included a benefit of $0.05 related to the resolution of certain legacy tax matters, minor adjustments to the 2007 restructuring reserve and dilution of $0.04 relating to the acquisition of Fermat. Excluding the legacy tax matters and restructuring items in both years, diluted earnings per share of $1.82 for the full-year 2008 decreased 27% from $2.50for the full-year of 2007.
Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys, said, Weak credit market conditions that prevailed throughout most of 2008 were exacerbated in the fourth quarter by the broader downturn in global economic activity. Moodys performance in this difficult environment reflects ongoing cost management efforts and resilience from the areas of our business that generate recurring revenue. Referring to the companys outlook for 2009, Mr. McDaniel added, Unusually challenging conditions are likely to persist through much of 2009, and we will remain focused on activities aimed at restoring investor confidence, supporting global regulatory and policymaking efforts that respond to the crisis, and meeting the needs of financial market participants.
Fourth Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue declined 20% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 18 percent. U.S. revenue of $195.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 29% from the fourth quarter of 2007, while non-U.S. revenue of $208.2 million decreased 9% from the prior-year period. Non-U.S. revenue accounted for 52% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, up from 45% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $253.9 million, a decrease of 32% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 29 percent. U.S. revenue of $125.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 40% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Outside the U.S., revenue of $128.0 million, representing 50% of global MIS revenue, declined 21% from the year-ago period.
Within the ratings business, global structured finance revenue totaled $92.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, a decrease of 42% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 57%, driven by declines in issuance across all asset classes. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 26%, led by declines in European commercial real-estate finance and credit derivatives.
Global corporate finance revenue of $56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 37% from the same quarter of 2007. U.S. corporate finance revenue decreased 45% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Outside the U.S., revenue declined 23% from the prior-year period. Declines were driven by the reduction in issuance of both investment-grade and speculative-grade securities.
Global financial institutions revenue of $56.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 15% compared to the same quarter of 2007. Financial institutions revenue in the U.S. decreased 16% due to declines in issuance for the banking and insurance sectors. Outside the U.S., revenue decreased 14% primarily driven by declines in European bank issuance.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $48.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, declining 15% from the fourth quarter of 2007. U.S. revenue declined 19% due to lower levels of activity in the public finance sector. Non-U.S. revenue decreased 7% with strong increases in project and infrastructure finance activity in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region more than offset by difficult market conditions for the rest of the non-U.S. business.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics for the fourth quarter of 2008 reached $149.8 million, up 13% from the same quarter of 2007. Revenue from the subscription line of business increased 9% from the prior-year period to $122.0 million, which continued to represent more than 80% of Moodys Analytics revenue and contributed the majority of dollar growth. The smaller software and consulting business lines produced revenue growth of 39% and 40%, respectively.
In the U.S., Moodys Analytics revenue of $69.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 6% from the fourth quarter of 2007. U.S. revenue growth was driven by the subscription and consulting business lines, reflecting demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research and other offerings. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 21% over the prior-year period to $80.2 million, representing 54% of global Moodys Analytics revenue. Growth outside the U.S. was strong in all areas, especially in the software line of business where results were positively impacted by the fourth quarter acquisition of Fermat.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Expenses
Fourth quarter 2008 operating expenses for Moodys Corporation of $278.3 million were 5% lower than in the prior-year period. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2007 and minor adjustments to this charge in 2008, Moodys operating expenses were 14% higher in 2008 than in the prior-year period. The primary driver of the increase was higher incentive costs compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, when compensation accruals were adjusted to reflect weak performance for the second half of 2007. It was also due to incremental expenses from businesses acquired in 2008. Moodys reported operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 31.1%.
Full-year 2008 operating expenses for Moodys Corporation of $1,007.2 million were 11% lower than the prior year. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2007 and minor adjustments to this charge in 2008, Moodys operating expenses were 6% lower in 2008, due primarily to reduced compensation costs.
Fourth Quarter Effective Tax Rate
Moodys effective tax rate was 28.6% for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 33.8% for the prior-year period. The decrease was due primarily to a larger portion of consolidated taxable income generated in lower tax jurisdictions outside the U.S., and the realization of benefits available for U.S.-based manufacturing and research activities.
Full-Year 2008 Results
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $1,204.7 million for the full-year 2008, a decrease of 32% from full-year 2007. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 33%. U.S. revenue of $645.0 million decreased 42%, while non-U.S. revenue of $559.7 million decreased 15% from the prior year. The public, project and infrastructure business line achieved modest growth, with all other MIS business lines recording declines from the prior year, led by structured finance.
Moodys Analytics revenue rose to $550.7 million for the full-year 2008, up 15% from the full-year 2007. Both the subscription and consulting business lines generated good growth, and the software line of business grew by 25% over the prior year, including the impact of the Fermat acquisition. U.S. revenue of $265.1 million for the full-year 2008 increased 9% from the full-year 2007. Non-U.S. revenue of $285.6 million increased 21% from 2007 and represented 52% of global revenue, compared to 49% a year earlier.
Share Repurchases and Debt Capacity
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Moodys repurchased 4.8 million shares at a total cost of $120.1 million and issued 136 thousand shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2008 totaled 235.1 million, representing a 6% decrease from a year earlier. Fourth quarter share repurchases were funded by a combination of free cash flow and borrowings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At year-end, Moodys had $1.5 billion of outstanding debt with additional debt capacity available of approximately $300 million.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2009
Moodys outlook for 2009 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the impact of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from our current outlook.
For Moodys overall, the Company expects full-year 2009 revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation in 2009 at current rates. Although Moodys has a solid base of recurring revenue, we anticipate issuance-based revenue to reflect generally weak conditions throughout 2009, with any broad improvement in market liquidity and issuance expected to be modest and to occur later in the year. Full-year 2009 operating expenses are expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range, including costs associated with the Fermat acquisition. We expect the full-year 2009 operating margin will be in the mid- to high-thirties percent range, due to lower ratings revenue and higher comparable expenses. The Company projects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2009 in the range of $1.40 to $1.50.
For the global MIS business, we expect revenue for the full-year 2009 to decline in the high single-digit percent range, both in the U.S. and internationally. Structured finance revenue for full-year 2009 is expected to decrease in the high-teens to low-twenties percent range, reflecting continued declines across all asset classes. Corporate finance revenue for full-year 2009 is expected to decrease in the mid- to high single-digit percent range, with weakness most pronounced in speculative-grade issuance and bank loans. Revenue from financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance ratings for full-year 2009 is expected to be about flat with full-year 2008.
For Moodys Analytics, we expect full-year 2009 revenue growth in the mid single-digit percent range, including revenue from Fermat. We expect strong revenue growth in the software and consulting businesses to offset a revenue decline in the subscription business in the low single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we project Moodys Analytics revenue to be about flat with full-year 2008. Outside the U.S. we expect Moodys Analytics revenue to increase in the low double-digit percent range.
