Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 27, 2009, Moody's Corporation (the "Company") approved a restructuring plan (the "Plan") to reduce costs in response to a strategic review of its business in certain jurisdictions and weak global economic and market conditions. This will result in an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $10-$16 million of which a majority will be recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The Plan consists of headcount reductions ($9-$12 million) and other charges (totaling $1-$4 million) such as contract termination costs and the potential divestitures of non-strategic assets. The Company's plans include closing offices in South Bend, Indiana; Indonesia and Taiwan. The Plan will result in a global headcount reduction of between 120 and 170 positions, representing 3-4% of headcount as of December 31, 2008. The entire charge will result in cash outlays which will be paid out over the next twelve months.

Certain statements contained in this current report are forward-looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moody's business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this current report are made as of the filing date, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise.

Those factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability to control costs and successfully implement various cost-reduction programs, including the restructuring plan, the current world-wide credit market disruptions and economic slowdown, which is affecting and could continue to affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets; other matters that could affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets, including credit quality concerns, changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; the uncertain effectiveness and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign government initiatives to respond to the economic slowdown; concerns in the marketplace affecting our credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of independent agency ratings; the introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressure from competitors and/or customers; the impact of regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and the potential for new U.S., state and local legislation and regulations; the potential for increased competition and regulation in foreign jurisdictions; exposure to litigation related to our rating opinions, as well as any other litigation to which the Company may be subject from time to time; the possible loss of key employees; failures or malfunctions of our operations and infrastructure; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Company's global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those Legacy Tax Matters and legal contingencies that relate to the Company, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which Moody's has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate acquired businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions; and other risk factors as discussed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and in other filings made by the Company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
