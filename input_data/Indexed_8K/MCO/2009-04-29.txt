Moodys Corporation Reports Results for First Quarter 2009
Reported 1Q09 EPS of $0.38; excluding restructuring, 1Q09 EPS of $0.41
1Q09 revenue of $408.9 million, down 5% from prior-year period
Reaffirming FY 2009 EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.50
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2009--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the first quarter 2009.
Summary of Results for First Quarter 2009
Moodys reported revenue of $408.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, a decrease of 5% from $430.7 million for the first quarter of 2008. Operating income for the quarter was $148.9 million, a 25% decline from $199.3 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 for the first quarter of 2009, and included a charge of $0.03 relating to restructuring actions in the quarter. Excluding the restructuring charge, diluted earnings per share declined 15% to $0.41 for the quarter versus $0.48 in the prior-year period.
Moodys results in the first quarter reflected some improvement in credit market activity compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, despite the broader economic downturn, said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. While we are encouraged by the increased level of activity, certain areas of the credit markets remain largely inactive and we continue to expect only limited recovery in 2009. As a result, we are reaffirming our full-year 2009 EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.50.
First Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $408.9 million declined 5% from the first quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $208.9 million for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 10% from the first quarter of 2008, while non-U.S. revenue of $200.0 million increased 1% from the prior-year period. Non-U.S. revenue accounted for 49% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, up from 46% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the first quarter of 2009 was $270.2 million, a decrease of 9% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $145.4 million for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 13% from the first quarter of 2008. Outside the U.S., revenue of $124.8 million declined 5% from the year-ago period.
Within the ratings business, global structured finance revenue totaled $72.4 million for the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of 29% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 42%, due to limited new issuance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 16%, driven by declines in European credit derivatives ratings.
Global corporate finance revenue of $84.1 million in the first quarter of 2009 increased 15% from the same quarter of 2008. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 18% from the first quarter of 2008. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 9% from the prior-year period. Growth was driven by strong issuance of investment-grade bonds primarily due to refinancing of maturing debt.
Global financial institutions revenue of $56.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 16% compared to the same quarter of 2008. Financial institutions revenue in the U.S. decreased 26% due to issuance declines in the insurance and banking sectors. Outside the U.S., revenue decreased 7% as issuance growth was more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $57.4 million for the first quarter of 2009, increasing 3% from the first quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue was about flat with the prior-year period as solid infrastructure finance activity offset lower issuance in the municipal sector. Non-U.S. revenue increased 8% with strong increases in public finance issuance in Europe.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics for the first quarter of 2009 reached $138.7 million, up 5% from the same quarter of 2008. Subscription revenue of $117.0 million was about flat with the prior-year period, and continued to represent more than 80% of Moodys Analytics revenue. Software revenue, which includes the effect of the Fermat acquisition in October 2008, grew 69% while revenue in the consulting business grew 17% from the prior-year period.
In the U.S., Moodys Analytics revenue of $63.5 million for the first quarter of 2009 decreased 4% from the first quarter of 2008. Weakness among financial services customers resulted in higher customer attrition that was partially offset by new subscription contracts, software licenses and consulting engagements. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 13% over the prior-year period to $75.2 million, reflecting the impact of acquisitions made in 2008.
First Quarter Expenses
First quarter 2009 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $260.0 million were 12% higher than in the prior-year period. Excluding the restructuring charge of $11.8 million, expenses were 7% higher than in the prior-year period. Moodys reported operating margin for the first quarter of 2009 was 36.4%. Excluding the restructuring charge, operating margin was 39.3%.
First Quarter Effective Tax Rate
Moodys effective tax rate was 35.7% for the first quarter of 2009, compared with 38.4% for the prior-year period. The decrease was due primarily to a larger portion of taxable income generated in lower tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. and net reductions to tax and tax-related liabilities.
Share Repurchases and Debt Capacity
During the first quarter of 2009 Moodys had no share repurchase activity and issued 0.7 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2009 totaled 235.7 million, representing a 4% decrease from a year earlier. Additionally, as of March 31, 2009, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.4 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $300 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2009
Moodys outlook for 2009 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the impact of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from our current outlook.
Moodys is reaffirming its 2009 full-year EPS guidance; however, other components of 2009 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view on credit market conditions and implications for the Company. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation in 2009 at current exchange rates. For Moodys overall, the Company now expects full-year 2009 revenue to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue expectations for certain areas have changed based on conditions specific to those sectors and geographies. We continue to anticipate issuance-based revenue to reflect generally weak conditions throughout 2009. We expect a more constant level of expense throughout 2009 versus 2008, with full-year 2009 expenses expected to increase in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2009 operating margin is projected in the mid- to high-thirties percent range. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2009 in the range of $1.40 to $1.50.
For the global MIS business, we expect revenue for the full-year 2009 to decline in the high-single-digit percent range, both in the U.S. and internationally. We now expect structured finance revenue for full-year 2009 to decrease in the low-twenties percent range, with declines across all asset classes. Corporate finance revenue for full-year 2009 is now expected to be about flat with full-year 2008, reflecting higher issuance forecasts for ongoing refinancing activity. Revenue from financial institution ratings is now expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range and we expect public, project and infrastructure finance revenue for full-year 2009 to be about flat with full-year 2008.
For Moodys Analytics, we anticipate full-year 2009 revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range. We expect strong growth in software and consulting revenue to offset a decline in subscription revenue in the low-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we now project Moodys Analytics revenue to decline in the low-single-digit percent range. Outside the U.S., we expect Moodys Analytics revenue to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.
