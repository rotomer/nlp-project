Moodys Corporation Reports Results for Second Quarter 2009
Reported 2Q09 EPS of $0.46; excluding restructuring and legacy tax, EPS of $0.43
2Q09 revenue of $450.7 million, down 8% from prior-year period
Raising FY 2009 EPS guidance to range of $1.45 to $1.55
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2009--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the second quarter of 2009.
Summary of Results for Second Quarter 2009
Moodys reported revenue of $450.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, a decrease of 8% from $487.6 million for the second quarter of 2008. Operating income for the quarter was $187.2 million, a 20% decline from $233.7 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for the second quarter of 2009 included a benefit of $0.03 associated with certain legacy tax matters and costs for previously announced restructuring activities. Excluding these items from both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter declined 16% from $0.51 in the prior-year period.
Moodys results in the second quarter reflected some improvement in credit market activity, said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. We are raising our full-year 2009 EPS guidance to $1.45 to $1.55 based on first half performance; however, we remain cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.
Second Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $450.7 million declined 8% from the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 4 percent. U.S. revenue of $237.1 million for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 10% from the second quarter of 2008, while non-U.S. revenue of $213.6 million decreased 5% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, non-U.S. revenue increased 3 percent. Non-U.S. revenue accounted for 47% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, essentially flat with 46% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the second quarter of 2009 was $310.3 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 9 percent. U.S. revenue of $173.7 million for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 13% from the second quarter of 2008. Outside the U.S., revenue of $136.6 million declined 13% from the year-ago period.
Within the ratings business, global structured finance revenue totaled $74.6 million for the second quarter of 2009, a decrease of 35% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 33%, with limited new issuance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 38%, driven by declines in all asset classes.
Global corporate finance revenue of $107.5 million in the second quarter of 2009 increased 9% from the same quarter of 2008. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 15% from the second quarter of 2008, primarily driven by better activity in the high-yield market. Outside the U.S., revenue was about flat with the prior-year period, with increased activity in the investment-grade sector in Europe offset by declines in other regions.
Global financial institutions revenue of $67.3 million in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 10% compared to the same quarter of 2008. Financial institutions revenue in the U.S. decreased 17% due to issuance declines in the insurance and banking sectors. Outside the U.S., revenue decreased 5% as increased issuance activity in the insurance sector was more than offset by declines in banking revenue.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $60.9 million for the second quarter of 2009, decreasing 8% from the second quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue decreased 18% from the prior-year period, primarily due to lower issuance activity in the municipal sector. Non-U.S. revenue increased 22% with strong issuance in project and infrastructure finance in Europe.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics for the second quarter of 2009 reached $140.4 million, up 7% from the same quarter of 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 9 percent. Subscription revenue of $117.8 million was about flat with the prior-year period, and represented more than 80% of Moodys Analytics revenue. Software revenue grew 83% while revenue in professional services was about flat with the prior-year period.
In the U.S., Moodys Analytics revenue of $63.4 million for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 2% from the second quarter of 2008. Weakness among financial services customers resulted in higher customer attrition rates, partially offset by new subscription contracts, software licenses and professional services engagements. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 14% over the prior-year period to $77.0 million, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions made in 2008.
Second Quarter Expenses
Second quarter 2009 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $263.5 million were 4% higher than in the prior-year period, and Moodys reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2009 was 41.5%. Excluding the restructuring adjustments in both periods, expenses were 2% higher than the prior-year period and operating margin was 42.2%, compared to 47.9% in the prior-year period. Without the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, reported expenses increased 9% and reported operating income declined 19 percent.
Second Quarter Effective Tax Rate
Moodys effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter of 2009, compared with 38.5% for the prior-year period. Excluding certain legacy tax matters and restructuring efforts in both periods, the effective tax rate was 38.8% for the second quarter of 2009, compared with 39.6% in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable income generated internationally in lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-Date Results
Moodys Corporation revenue for the first six months of 2009 totaled $859.6 million, a decrease of 6% from $918.3 million for the same period of 2008. Expenses for the first six months of 2009 were $523.5 million, and increased 8% from a year ago. First half operating income of $336.1 million was down 22% from $433.0 million for the same period of 2008. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenue and operating income for the first six months of 2009 decreased 2% and 21%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $0.84 for the first half of 2009 included a charge of $0.01 associated with certain legacy tax matters and the previously announced restructuring plans. Excluding these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.85 for the first half of 2009 decreased 14% from $0.99 for the first half of 2008.
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $580.5 million for the first six months of 2009, a decrease of 11% from the prior-year period. Moodys Analytics revenue rose to $279.1 million for the first half of 2009, up 6% from the first half of 2008.
Share Repurchases and Debt Capacity
During the second quarter of 2009, Moodys had no share repurchase activity and issued 0.6 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2009 totaled 236.3 million, representing a 3% decrease from a year earlier. Additionally, as of June 30, 2009, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.3 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $400 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Moodys reduced total outstanding debt by $80 million during the second quarter and $137 million for the first half of 2009.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2009
Moodys outlook for 2009 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the impact of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from our current outlook.
Moodys is revising its outlook for the full-year 2009 to reflect stronger first half performance and anticipated weakness in business conditions for the rest of the year.This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at current exchange rates. While our expectations for revenue have modestly improved, the Company still expects full-year 2009 revenue to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue expectations for certain areas have changed based on conditions specific to those businesses and geographies. We now expect full-year 2009 expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2009 operating margin is still projected in the mid- to high-thirties percent range. The Company now expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2009 in the range of $1.45 to $1.55.
For the global MIS business, we still expect revenue for the full-year 2009 to decline in the high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we continue to expect MIS revenue to decline in the high-single-digit percent range, while we now expect MIS revenue outside the U.S. to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. We now expect structured finance revenue for full-year 2009 to decrease in the mid-twenties percent range, with declines across all asset classes. Corporate finance revenue for full-year 2009 is now expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range from full-year 2008, reflecting strong investment- and speculative-grade activity in the first half of this year. Revenue from financial institution ratings is still expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue for full-year 2009 is still expected to be about flat with full-year 2008.
For Moodys Analytics, full-year 2009 revenue growth is now expected to be in the low-single-digit percent range. We expect strong growth in software revenue to offset a decline in subscription revenue in the low-single-digit percent range and a decline in professional services revenue in the high-single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced customer spend for training services through this challenging economic environment. Within the U.S., we still project Moodys Analytics revenue to decline in the low-single-digit percent range. Outside the U.S., we now expect Moodys Analytics revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.
