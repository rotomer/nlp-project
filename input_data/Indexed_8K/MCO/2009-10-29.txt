Moodys Corporation Reports Results for Third Quarter 2009
Reported 3Q09 EPS of $0.42; excluding restructuring, EPS of $0.43
3Q09 revenue of $451.8 million, up 4% from prior-year period
Raising FY 2009 EPS guidance to range of $1.60 to $1.68
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 29, 2009--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the third quarter of 2009.
Summary of Results for Third Quarter 2009
Moodys reported revenue of $451.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009, an increase of 4% from $433.4 million for the third quarter of 2008. Operating income for the quarter was $172.5 million, a 9% decline from $189.8 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 for the third quarter of 2009 included a charge of $0.01 related to previously announced restructuring activities. Excluding the restructuring adjustment from both periods and the benefit related to legacy tax matters in the prior-year period, diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter declined 4% from $0.45 in the prior-year period.
Moodys third quarter results reflected continuing strength in corporate debt issuance as well as growth from Moodys Analytics, said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. While improvement in other sectors of the credit markets remains uneven, we are raising our full-year 2009 EPS guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.68 to reflect our expectation that corporate bond activity will remain strong through year-end.
Third Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $451.8 million increased 4% from the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 6 percent. U.S. revenue of $229.7 million for the third quarter of 2009 increased 5% from the third quarter of 2008, while non-U.S. revenue of $222.1 million increased 3% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, non-U.S. revenue increased 8 percent. Non-U.S. revenue accounted for 49% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, essentially flat with 50% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the third quarter of 2009 was $305.3 million, an increase of 3% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 5 percent. U.S. revenue of $164.8 million for the third quarter of 2009 increased 8% from the third quarter of 2008. Outside the U.S., revenue of $140.5 million declined 2% from the year-ago period.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $101.4 million in the third quarter of 2009 increased 32% from the same quarter of 2008. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 35% from the third quarter of 2008, primarily driven by better activity in the high-yield market. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 27% from the prior-year period, primarily due to issuance of investment-grade securities in Europe.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $79.2 million for the third quarter of 2009, a decrease of 17% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 8%, with new issuance limited primarily to TALF-related securitizations. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 24%, driven by revenue declines in derivatives and asset-backed securities.
Global financial institutions revenue of $62.9 million in the third quarter of 2009 decreased 2% compared to the same quarter of 2008, due to issuance declines in the banking sector. U.S. financial institutions revenue decreased 4%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 1 percent.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $61.8 million for the third quarter of 2009, an increase of 4% from the third quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue decreased 2% from the prior-year period, primarily due to lower issuance activity in the municipal sector. Non-U.S. revenue increased 14% with strong issuance in European infrastructure finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics ("MA") for the third quarter of 2009 reached $146.5 million, up 7% from the same quarter of 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 10 percent. Subscription revenue of $118.9 million was about flat with the prior-year period, and represented more than 80% of Moodys Analytics revenue. Software revenue grew 82%, while revenue in professional services increased 9% from the prior-year period.
In the U.S., MA revenue of $64.9 million for the third quarter of 2009 was about flat with the third quarter of 2008. Modestly higher attrition from financial institution customers was offset by new subscription business and growth in software revenue. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 14% over the prior-year period to $81.6 million, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions made in 2008.
Third Quarter Expenses
Third quarter 2009 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $279.3 million were 15% higher than in the prior-year period. The increase reflects incremental expenses from businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 and higher accruals for incentive compensation reflecting the stronger full-year outlook. Moodys reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2009 was 38.2%. Excluding the restructuring adjustments in both periods, expenses were 12% higher than the prior-year period and operating margin was 39.0%, compared to 43.4% in the prior-year period. Without the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, reported expenses increased 18% and reported operating income declined 8% percent.
Moodys effective tax rate was 37.5% for the third quarter of 2009, compared with 38.4% for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable income generated internationally in lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-Date Results
Moodys Corporation revenue for the first nine months of 2009 totaled $1,311.4 million, a decrease of 3% from $1,351.7 million for the same period of 2008. Expenses for the first nine months of 2009 were $802.8 million, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Year-to-date operating income of $508.6 million was down 18% from $622.8 million for the same period of 2008. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenue for the first nine months of 2009 was about flat with the prior-year period and operating income decreased 17 percent. Diluted earnings per share of $1.26 for the first nine months of 2009 included a net charge of $0.02, reflecting costs related to previously announced restructuring plans partially offset by a benefit from certain legacy tax matters. Excluding these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share of $1.28 for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 11% from $1.44 for the first nine months of 2008.
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $885.8 million for the first nine months of 2009, a decrease of 7% from the prior-year period. Moodys Analytics revenue rose to $425.6 million for the first nine months of 2009, up 6% from the first nine months of 2008.
Share Repurchases and Debt Capacity
During the third quarter of 2009, Moodys did not repurchase shares and issued 0.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2009 totaled 236.5 million, representing a 1% decrease from a year earlier. Additionally, as of September 30, 2009, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.3 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $450 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Moodys reduced total outstanding debt by approximately $50 million during the third quarter and $187 million for the first nine months of 2009.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2009
Moodys outlook for 2009 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the impact of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from our current outlook.
Moodys is revising its outlook for the full-year 2009 due to continuing strength in corporate debt issuance.This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of third quarter exchange rates. We now expect revenue for the full-year 2009 to be about flat versus full-year 2008. Revenue expectations for certain areas have changed based on conditions specific to those businesses and geographies. We now expect full-year 2009 expenses to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2009 operating margin is now projected in the high-thirties percent range and the effective tax rate is now expected in the range of 37 to 38 percent. The Company now expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2009 in the range of $1.60 to $1.68.
For the global MIS business, we now expect revenue for the full-year 2009 to decline in the low-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we now expect MIS revenue to be about flat with the prior-year period. We continue to expect MIS revenue outside the U.S. to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. We now expect corporate finance revenue for full-year 2009 to increase in the low-thirties percent range from full-year 2008, reflecting strong activity in both investment-grade and speculative-grade issuance. We still expect structured finance revenue for full-year 2009 to decrease in the mid-twenties percent range, with declines across all asset classes. Revenue from financial institution ratings is still expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range, while revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance for the full-year 2009 is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, full-year 2009 revenue growth is still expected to be in the low-single-digit percent range, driven by our expectations for strong growth in software revenue attributable to the Fermat acquisition. We now project subscription revenue to be about flat with full-year 2008 results, while professional services revenue is now expected to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we still anticipate MA revenue will decline in the low-single-digit percent range, and outside the U.S., we still expect revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.
