NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 4, 2010--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009.
Summary of Results for Fourth Quarter 2009
Moodys reported revenue of $485.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 20% from $403.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income for the quarter was $178.9 million, a 43% increase from $125.4 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2009 included a benefit of $0.01 related to previously announced restructuring activities. Excluding restructuring adjustments in both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.42 for the quarter increased 14% from $0.37 in the prior-year period.
Summary of Results for Full-Year 2009
Moodys Corporation revenue for the full-year 2009 totaled $1,797.2 million, an increase of 2% from $1,755.4 million for 2008. U.S. revenue of $920.8 million increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue of $876.4 million increased 4% from the prior year. Operating income of $687.5 million declined 8% from $748.2 million for the full-year 2008, and the operating margin was 38.3% for the full-year 2009. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, revenue increased 4% from the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Diluted earnings per share of $1.69 for the full-year 2009 included a net charge of $0.01, reflecting costs related to previously announced restructuring plans partially offset by a benefit from certain legacy tax matters. Excluding these items in both years, diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the full-year 2009 decreased 7% from $1.82for the full-year 2008.
"Moody's full-year results reflected gradual improvement of credit markets throughout 2009. Strength in corporate debt issuance and growth from Moody's Analytics provided a slight increase in revenue from the prior year, but activity was limited in other areas of the markets," said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. "We anticipate continuing recovery for 2010, but also expect market conditions to remain challenging until economic improvement across key markets is sustained. With this outlook, we are projecting a stronger revenue increase and a return to earnings growth for 2010, with ongoing expense management to support business initiatives and regulatory and compliance efforts.
Fourth Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $485.8 million increased 20% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 17 percent. U.S. revenue of $245.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 25% from the fourth quarter of 2008, while revenue generated outside the U.S. of $240.7 million increased 16% from the prior-year period. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 50% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, down from 52% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $331.9 million, an increase of 31% from the prior-year period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 26 percent. U.S. revenue of $179.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 42% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Outside the U.S., revenue of $152.8 million increased 19% from the year-ago period.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $115.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 99% from the same quarter of 2008. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 106% from the fourth quarter of 2008, while outside the U.S., revenue increased 90% from the prior-year period. Growth was primarily driven by activity in the high-yield bond market.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $78.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, a decrease of 14% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue increased 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting increased issuance activity from asset-backed securities and commercial real-estate finance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 25%, driven by revenue declines across all asset classes as improved credit market conditions slowed use of securitization for central bank supported programs.
Global financial institutions revenue of $72.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 27% compared to the same quarter of 2008, due to gains from the banking sector. U.S. financial institutions revenue increased 18%, while non-U.S. revenue increased 35 percent.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $66.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 36% from the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue increased 36% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by stimulus plan-related public finance issuance. Non-U.S. revenue increased 35% with strong issuance in European infrastructure finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the fourth quarter of 2009 reached $153.9 million, up 3% from the same quarter of 2008. Foreign currency translation did not materially impact revenue. Reflecting a realignment of revenue by product grouping in both periods, revenue from subscription-based research, data and analytics of $106.0 million declined by 1% from the prior-year period; risk management software revenue of $42.3 million grew 21%; and professional services revenue of $5.6 million decreased 26% from the prior-year period. A reconciliation table for MA revenue is available at the end of this press release.
In the U.S., MA revenue of $66.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 declined 5% from the prior-year period, reflecting the effects of customer attrition due to financial market disruption in late 2008 and early 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 10% over the prior-year period to $87.9 million, primarily due to growth in the risk management software business.
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Expenses
Fourth quarter 2009 expense for Moodys Corporation of $306.9 million was 10% higher than in the prior-year period and included higher accruals for performance-based compensation. Moodys reported operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 36.8%. Excluding the restructuring adjustments in the current period, expenses were 11% higher than the prior-year period and operating margin was 36.6%, compared to 31.1% in the prior-year period. Without the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, reported expenses increased 8%.
Full-year 2009 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $1,109.7 million were 10% higher than the prior year. Excluding restructuring adjustments in both periods, Moodys expenses were 8% higher in 2009, primarily due to incremental expenses from businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 and higher incentive compensation.
Moodys effective tax rate was 38.3% for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with 28.6% for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to a favorable true-up of the full-year 2008 tax accrual in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate included realization of U.S. manufacturing and research credits and deductions. The annual effective tax rate for 2009 was 37.0% compared to 36.7% for 2008.
Full-Year 2009 Revenue Results
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $1,217.7 million for the full-year 2009, an increase of 1% from the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 3 percent. U.S. revenue of $663.1 million increased 3%, while non-U.S. revenue of $554.6 million decreased 1% from the prior year.
Moodys Analytics revenue rose to $579.5 million for the full-year of 2009, up 5% from the full-year of 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased by 7 percent. Revenue from research, data and analytics declined by 1% to $413.6 million, and professional services revenue was down 10% to $20.8 million. For the risk management software business, revenue increased 33% to $145.1 million, due to the acquisition of Fermat International in late 2008 and good growth from legacy products and services. U.S. revenue of $257.7 million decreased 3% from the full-year 2008 results. Non-U.S. revenue of $321.8 million increased 13% from 2008 and represented 56% of total revenue, up from 52% in 2008.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
On December 15, 2009, Moodys increased its quarterly dividend by 5% to 10.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Moodys did not repurchase shares and issued 0.4 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2009 totaled 236.9 million, representing a 1% increase from a year earlier. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At year-end, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $550 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Moodys reduced total outstanding debt by $87 million during the fourth quarter and $274 million for the full-year of 2009. At year-end, total cash and cash equivalents were $473.9 million, an increase of $228 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2010
Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
For Moodys overall, the Company expects full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2010 expenses are also expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2010 operating margin is projected in the high-thirties percent range and the effective tax rate is expected in the range of 37 to 38 percent. Share repurchase is expected to resume at modest levels in 2010 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2010 in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-year 2009 rates.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full-year 2010 is expected to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens percent range with anticipated growth in speculative-grade issuance activity offset by moderation of investment-grade issuance from the high volume of 2009. Structured finance revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range reflecting modest growth in most asset classes. Revenue from financial institution ratings is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range, while revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, full-year 2010 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Revenue growth is expected in the low-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, in the mid-teens percent range for risk management software, and in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range for professional services. MA revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range in the U.S. and in the mid-single-digit percent range outside the U.S.
