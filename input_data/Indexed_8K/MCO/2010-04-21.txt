Exhibit 99.1
Moodys Corporation Reports Results for First Quarter 2010
1Q10 revenue up 17%
Reported 1Q10 EPS of $0.47 up 24% from 1Q09
FY 2010 EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.85 reaffirmed
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2010--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the first quarter 2010.
Summary of Results for First Quarter 2010
Moodys reported revenue of $476.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 17% from $408.9 million for the first quarter of 2009. Operating income for the quarter was $196.8 million, a 32% increase from $148.9 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.47 for the first quarter of 2010, 24% higher than $0.38 reported in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2009 and minor restructuring-related adjustments in 2010, diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in 2010 were 15% higher than $0.41 in the prior-year period.
"Moody's first quarter results reflected strong activity in corporate and financial institution debt markets, largely driven by high-yield bond and loan issuance," said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. "Despite good first quarter performance, we are reaffirming our full-year 2010 EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.85 due to uncertainty that issuance levels later in the year will continue to overcome weakness in some areas of structured finance.
First Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $476.6 million increased 17% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 14 percent. U.S. revenue of $254.6 million for the first quarter of 2010 increased 22% from the first quarter of 2009, while revenue generated outside the U.S. of $222.0 million increased 11% from the prior-year period. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 47% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the first quarter of 2010 was $335.5 million, an increase of 24% from the prior-year period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21 percent. U.S. revenue of $189.2 million for the first quarter of 2010 increased 30% from the first quarter of 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue of $146.3 million increased 17% from the year-ago period.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $126.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 increased 50% from the same quarter of 2009. U.S. corporate finance revenue grew 49% from the first quarter of 2009, while outside the U.S., revenue increased 53% from the prior-year period. Growth was primarily driven by strength of issuance activity in the high-yield bond and loan market.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $71.5 million for the first quarter of 2010, a decline of 1% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue grew 21% from the year-ago period, reflecting increased issuance activity from asset-backed securities and commercial real-estate finance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 17%, driven primarily by declines within Europe in most asset classes as better credit market conditions improved issuers access to liquidity and reduced issuance of new securitizations for government-sponsored facilities.
Global financial institutions revenue of $76.2 million in the first quarter of 2010 increased 35% compared to the same quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher levels of issuance in the banking and insurance sectors. U.S. financial institutions revenue increased 39%, while non-U.S. revenue increased 33 percent.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $61.4 million for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2009. U.S. revenue grew 6% from the prior-year period reflecting stronger public finance issuance across most sectors as well as improved project finance market conditions. Non-U.S. revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by investment-grade activity within project and infrastructure finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the first quarter of 2010 was $141.1 million, up 2% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 1 percent. Reflecting the realignment of revenue by product grouping in both periods, revenue from research, data and analytics of $104.6 million increased by 3% from the prior-year period and risk management software revenue of $33.3 million grew 4 percent. Professional services revenue of $3.2 million declined 30% from the prior-year period.
In the U.S., MA revenue of $65.4 million for the first quarter of 2010 increased 3% from the prior-year period. Outside the U.S., revenue of $75.7 million grew 1% compared to the same quarter of 2009.
First Quarter Expenses
First quarter 2010 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $279.8 million were 8% greater than in the prior-year period primarily due to higher accruals for performance-based compensation. Moodys reported operating margin for the first quarter of 2010 was 41.3 percent. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2009 and minor adjustments to this charge in 2010, Moodys first quarter 2010 expenses of $280.5 million were 13% higher in 2010 than in the prior-year period and operating margin was 41.1%, compared to 39.3% in the first quarter of 2009. Without the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, reported expenses increased 5 percent.
Moodys effective tax rate was 37.2% for the first quarter of 2010, compared with 35.7% for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to reductions in unrecognized tax benefits and other tax-related liabilities in the prior period that did not occur in the current quarter.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
During the first quarter of 2010, Moodys repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $30 million and issued 1.4 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2010 totaled 237.0 million, representing a 1% increase from a year earlier. As of March 31, 2010, Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.1 billion of outstanding debt and more than $600 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Moodys reduced total outstanding debt by $72 million during the first quarter. At quarter-end, total cash and cash equivalents were $496 million, an increase of $155 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2010
Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Moodys is reaffirming its 2010 full-year EPS guidance; however, certain components of 2010 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions and implications for the Company. For Moodys overall, the Company continues to expect full-year 2010 revenue and expenses to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. The Company continues to project the full-year 2010 operating margin in the high-thirties percent range and the effective tax rate in the range of 37 to 38 percent. Share repurchase is expected to continue at modest levels in 2010 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company continues to expect diluted earnings per share for full-year 2010 in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter rates.
For the global MIS business, we continue to expect revenue for the full-year 2010 to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we continue to expect MIS revenue to increase in the mid-teens percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low-twenties percent range with anticipated growth in speculative-grade issuance activity partially offset by moderation of investment-grade issuance from the high volume of 2009. Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range reflecting more limited European issuance activity from asset-backed securitizations and derivatives than previously anticipated. We continue to expect revenue from financial institutions to increase in the low-single-digit percent range, and revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, we continue to expect full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, while we now expect revenue growth in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range for risk management software, and in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range for professional services. We continue to expect MA revenue in the U.S. to increase in the low-single-digit percent range and revenue outside the U.S. to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.
