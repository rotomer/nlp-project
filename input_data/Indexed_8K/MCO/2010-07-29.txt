Moodys Corporation Reports Results for Second Quarter 2010
Reported 2Q10 EPS of $0.51; excluding legacy tax and restructuring-related adjustment, EPS of $0.49
2Q10 revenue of $477.8 million, up 6% from prior-year period
Reaffirming FY 2010 EPS guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2010--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the second quarter of 2010.
Summary of Results for Second Quarter 2010
Moodys Corporation reported revenue of $477.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010, an increase of 6% from $450.7 million for the second quarter of 2009. Operating income for the quarter was $190.5 million, a 2% increase from $187.2 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the second quarter of 2010 included a benefit of $0.02 associated with certain legacy tax matters and a minor restructuring-related adjustment. Excluding legacy tax and restructuring items from both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter grew 14% from $0.43 in the prior-year period.
Moodys results in the second quarter were strong given the greater volatility in debt capital markets as compared to the first quarter, said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys Corporation. We reaffirm our full-year 2010 EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.85 based on sound first half performance but we expect that uneven credit market conditions will persist during the second half.
Second Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $477.8 million increased 6% from the second quarter of 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation on revenue was negligible. U.S. revenue of $261.5 million for the quarter rose 10%, while non-U.S. revenue of $216.3 million increased 1% from the prior-year period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, non-U.S. revenue in the second quarter was about flat and represented 45% of total revenue for the quarter, compared to 47% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the second quarter of 2010 was $328.6 million, 6% above the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue of $194.5 million for the second quarter of 2010 increased 12% from the second quarter of 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue of $134.1 million declined 2% from the year-ago period.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $127.9 million in the second quarter of 2010 increased 19% from the same quarter of 2009. U.S. corporate finance revenue grew 30% from the second quarter of 2009, driven primarily by strong high-yield bank loan origination, which more than offset reduced issuance in the investment-grade bond market. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 1% from the prior-year period, as strong issuance in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by decreased activity in Europe and Canada.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $73.1 million for the second quarter of 2010, a decline of 2% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 4% from the year-ago period, as a result of reduced activity in derivatives and asset-backed commercial paper programs, partially offset by commercial real estate finance issuance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue grew 1%, driven primarily by European covered bond issuance, partially offset by lower securitization activity due to market and regulatory uncertainty and reduced use of government-sponsored facilities.
Global financial institutions revenue of $63.2 million in the second quarter of 2010 declined 6% compared to the same quarter of 2009. Financial institutions revenue decreased 9% in the U.S. and 4% outside the U.S., primarily due to issuance declines in the U.S. and European insurance and banking sectors.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $64.4 million for the second quarter of 2010, increasing 6% from the second quarter of 2009. U.S. revenue grew 13% from the prior-year period with higher revenue in the public and project finance sectors. Non-U.S. revenue declined 8% primarily due to reduced issuance for European infrastructure finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the second quarter of 2010 reached $149.2 million, up 6% from the same quarter of 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $105.2 million increased by 3% from the prior-year period and risk management software revenue of $39.2 million grew 16 percent. Professional services revenue of $4.8 million increased 14% from the prior-year period.
Moodys Analytics revenue in the second quarter of 2010 was $67.0 million in the U.S. and $82.2 million outside the U.S., an increase of 6% and 7% respectively from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the delivery of risk management software projects.
Second Quarter Expenses
Second quarter 2010 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $287.3 million were 9% greater than in the prior-year period primarily due to increased headcount and incentive compensation and higher spending related to legal and regulatory requirements. Moodys reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2010 was 39.9 percent. Excluding restructuring items in both periods, Moodys second quarter 2010 expenses of $287.0 million increased 10% from the prior-year period, and operating margin was 39.9%, compared to 42.2% in the second quarter of 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating expenses was negligible.
Moodys effective tax rate was 31.1% for the second quarter of 2010, compared with 36.4% for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and other tax-related liabilities resulting from the closing of various tax audits, lower taxes on foreign income and the favorable resolution of a legacy tax matter.
Year-to-Date Results
Moodys Corporation revenue for the first six months of 2010 totaled $954.4 million, an increase of 11% from $859.6 million for the same period of 2009. Expenses for the first six months of 2010 were $567.1 million, an increase of 8% from a year ago. First half operating income of $387.3 million grew 15% from $336.1 million for the same period of 2009. Excluding the positive impact of foreign currency translation, revenue and operating income for the first six months of 2010 grew 10% and 14%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $0.99 for the first half of 2010 included a benefit of $0.02 associated with certain legacy tax matters and minor restructuring-related adjustments. Excluding these items in the first half of 2010, and excluding a legacy tax benefit and restructuring charges and adjustments in the prior-year period, diluted earnings per share of $0.97 for the first half of 2010 increased 14% from $0.85 for the first half of 2009.
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $664.1 million for the first six months of 2010, an increase of 14% from the prior-year period. Moodys Analytics revenue rose 4% from the first half of 2009 to $290.3 million.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
During the second quarter of 2010, Moodys repurchased 2.8 million shares at a total cost of $70 million and issued 0.1 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2010 totaled 234.3 million, a 1% reduction from a year earlier. As of June 30, 2010, Moodys had $1.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.1 billion of outstanding debt and $644 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Moodys reduced total outstanding debt by $16 million during the second quarter. At quarter-end, total cash and cash equivalents were $486 million, an increase of $93 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2010
Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
Moodys is reaffirming its guidance for diluted earnings per share for full-year 2010 in the range of $1.75 to $1.85; however, certain components of 2010 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions and implications for the Company. For Moodys overall, the Company now expects full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range and expenses to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. We continue to believe incremental compliance costs related to new regulation will be approximately $15 million for this year and $15  25 million for next year. The Company still projects the full-year 2010 operating margin in the high-thirties percent range and now expects the effective tax rate in the range of 34 to 35 percent. Share repurchase is expected to continue at modest levels in 2010 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
For the global MIS business, we now expect revenue for the full-year 2010 to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., we continue to expect MIS revenue to increase in the low-double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to decline in the low-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens to low-twenties percent range. Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high-single to low-double-digit percent range. We now expect revenue from financial institutions to be relatively flat compared to the prior year, and revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, we continue to expect full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, while we now expect revenue growth in the low-double-digit percent range for risk management software, and in the mid-single-digit percent range for professional services. We now expect MA revenue in the U.S. to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, while revenue outside the U.S. is still expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.
