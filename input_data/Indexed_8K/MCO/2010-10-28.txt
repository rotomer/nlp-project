Moodys Corporation Reports Results for Third Quarter 2010
Reported 3Q10 EPS of $0.58
3Q10 revenue of $513.3 million, up 14% from prior-year period

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 28, 2010--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the third quarter of 2010.
Summary of Results for Third Quarter 2010
Moodys Corporation reported revenue of $513.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of 14% from $451.8 million for the third quarter of 2009. Operating income for the quarter was $188.9 million, a 10% increase from $172.5 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the third quarter of 2010 included a one-time tax benefit of $0.07 associated with foreign earnings. Excluding minor restructuring items from both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the quarter grew 35% from $0.43 in the prior-year period.
Moodys results in the third quarter reflected strong performance at Moodys Investors Service associated with robust capital market issuance and steady growth from Moodys Analytics, said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys Corporation. Based on year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year 2010 EPS guidance to a range of $1.90 to $1.96.
Third Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $513.3 million increased 14% from the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 16 percent. U.S. revenue of $278.3 million for the quarter rose 21%, while non-U.S. revenue of $235.0 million increased 6% from the prior-year period. Non-U.S. revenue represented 46% of total revenue for the quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, non-U.S. revenue in the third quarter rose 10 percent.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the third quarter of 2010 was $358.2 million, 17% higher than the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 20 percent. U.S. revenue of $207.2 million for the third quarter of 2010 was up 26% from the same period of 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue of $151.0 million grew 7 percent.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $144.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 increased 43% from the same quarter of 2009. U.S. corporate finance revenue rose 51%, driven by strong high-yield bank loan and bond origination for refinancing and increased merger and acquisition activity. Outside the U.S., revenue grew 29% from the prior-year period, primarily due to increased high-yield bond issuance in Europe and improved activity in Asia and Latin America.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $70.1 million for the third quarter of 2010, a decline of 11% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 8% from the year-ago period, with lower derivatives activity partially offset by improved issuance in commercial real estate finance. Structured finance revenue was down 15% outside the U.S., as reduced European derivatives and securitization issuance was partially offset by higher European covered bond activity.
Global financial institutions revenue of $73.6 million in the third quarter of 2010 grew 17% compared to the same quarter of 2009. Financial institutions revenue rose 14% in the U.S. due to higher insurance sector issuance, and grew 19% outside the U.S., primarily reflecting greater activity in the banking sector in most regions.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $69.6 million for the third quarter of 2010, increasing 13% from the third quarter of 2009. U.S. revenue grew 24%, driven by the public finance and infrastructure sectors. Non-U.S. revenue declined 7% from the prior-year period primarily as a result of reduced issuance for European infrastructure finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the third quarter of 2010 reached $155.1 million, 6% above the same quarter of 2009, primarily driven by the delivery of risk management software projects and improving demand for research and data. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $106.0 million increased 3% from the prior-year period and risk management software revenue of $42.8 million grew 16 percent. Professional services revenue of $6.3 million was flat with the prior-year period.
MA revenue in the third quarter of 2010 was $71.1 million in the U.S. and $84.0 million outside the U.S., up 10% and 3%, respectively, over the prior-year period.
Third Quarter Expenses
Third quarter 2010 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $324.4 million were 16% higher than the prior-year period primarily due to increased headcount, higher accruals for incentive compensation reflecting the stronger full-year outlook, and additional spending related to legal matters and regulatory requirements. Moodys reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2010 was 36.8% compared to 38.2% in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding restructuring items in both periods, third quarter 2010 expenses of $324.0 million increased 18% from the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on expenses was negligible.
Moodys effective tax rate was 24.4% for the third quarter of 2010, compared with 37.5% for the prior-year period. The decrease was largely due to a one-time tax benefit associated with foreign earnings.
Year-to-Date Results
Moodys Corporation revenue for the first nine months of 2010 totaled $1,467.7 million, an increase of 12% from $1,311.4 million for the same period of 2009. Expenses for the first nine months of 2010 were $891.5 million, an increase of 11% from a year ago. Operating income of $576.2 million grew 13% from $508.6 million for the same period of 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation on revenue and operating income for the first nine months of 2010 was negligible. Diluted earnings per share of $1.56 for the first nine months of 2010 included a benefit of $0.02 associated with certain legacy tax matters and minor restructuring-related adjustments, as well as a one-time tax benefit of $0.07 associated with foreign earnings. Excluding legacy tax benefits and restructuring adjustments from both periods, diluted earnings per share of $1.54 for the first nine months of 2010 increased 20% from $1.28 for the same period in 2009.
MIS revenue totaled $1,022.3 million for the first nine months of 2010, an increase of 15% from the prior-year period. MA revenue rose 5% from the same period of 2009 to $445.4 million.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
During the third quarter of 2010, Moodys repurchased 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $19.7 million and issued 0.8 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2010 totaled 234.2 million, a 1% reduction from a year earlier. As of September 30, 2010, Moodys had $1.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. Also during the third quarter, Moodys completed a public offering of $500 million of ten-year senior unsecured notes with a 5.5% coupon. Proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and other short-term and long-term borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business investments, and share buybacks. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.3 billion of outstanding debt and $985 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2010 were $794 million, an increase of $371 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2010
Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
Moodys is raising its guidance for diluted earnings per share for full-year 2010 to a range of $1.90 to $1.96. Certain components of 2010 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions and implications for the Company. For Moodys overall, the Company now expects full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the high-single to low-double-digit percent range and expenses to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. We continue to estimate incremental costs related to new regulation of approximately $15 million for this year and $15 to 25 million for next year. The Company still projects the full-year 2010 operating margin in the high-thirties percent range and now expects the 2010 effective tax rate in the range of 33 to 34 percent. Share repurchase is expected to continue at modest levels in 2010, subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
For the global MIS business, full-year 2010 revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. We now project MIS revenue growth in the high-teens percent range within the U.S. and in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range outside the U.S. Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low-thirties percent range. We now expect structured finance revenue to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range and revenue from financial institutions to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is still projected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, we continue to expect full-year 2010 revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. We still project revenue growth in the low-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics, while revenue in both the risk management software and professional services businesses is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. We still expect MA revenue both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.
