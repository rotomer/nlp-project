On January 6, 2011, Moody's Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing updated full-year 2010 guidance. The guidance is set forth in a press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, unless it is specifically incorporated by reference therein. The Company's updated guidance for 2010 is based on assumptions about many factors that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company has identified certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. Those factors are incorporated herein by reference from the Company's press release dated October 28, 2010 reporting results for the third quarter 2010, as furnished on a Form 8-K dated October 28, 2010. The Company's updated guidance for 2010 and other statements in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are made as of January 6, 2011, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise.
