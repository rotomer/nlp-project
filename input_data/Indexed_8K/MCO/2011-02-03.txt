NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2011--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010.
Summary of Results for Fourth Quarter 2010
Moodys reported revenue of $564.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 16% from $485.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating income for the quarter was $196.6 million, up 10% from $178.9 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 35% from $0.43 in the fourth quarter of 2009, and included a tax benefit of $0.08 primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes.
"Moody's fourth quarter and full-year 2010 results reflected strong performance in credit ratings and growth in all areas of Moodys Analytics," said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. "We anticipate market conditions to remain generally favorable in 2011. With this outlook, we are projecting revenue increases across most areas of our business and earnings per share in the range of $2.12-$2.22.
Summary of Results for Full-Year 2010
Moodys Corporation revenue for the full-year 2010 totaled $2,032.0 million, an increase of 13% from $1,797.2 million for 2009. U.S. revenue of $1,089.5 million grew 18%, while non-U.S. revenue of $942.5 million rose 8% from the prior year.
Operating income of $772.8 million increased 12% from $687.5 million in 2009, and operating margin was 38.0% for the full-year 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on revenue and operating income was negligible.
Diluted earnings per share of $2.15 for the full-year 2010 grew 27% from $1.69 in 2009 and included a legacy tax benefit in the second quarter of $0.02 and other tax benefits of $0.15 in the second half of 2010 associated with foreign earnings and state taxes.
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service (MIS) totaled $1,405.0 million for the full-year 2010, an increase of 15% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $815.4 million grew 23%. Non-U.S. revenue of $589.6 million was up 6% from the prior year and represented 42% of MIS revenue, down from 46% in 2009.

Fourth Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $564.3 million increased 16% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue rose 17 percent. U.S. revenue of $295.1 million for the quarter rose 20%, while non-U.S. revenue of $269.2 million increased 12% from the prior-year period. Non-U.S. revenue represented 48% of total revenue for the quarter, down from 50% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $382.7 million, 15% higher than the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased 17 percent. U.S. revenue of $224.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 was up 25% from the same period of 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue of $158.2 million grew 4 percent.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $164.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 43% from the same quarter of 2009. U.S. corporate finance revenue rose 59%, driven by growth across all asset classes, particularly high-yield bank loans. Outside the U.S., revenue grew 20% primarily due to increased bond issuance in Europe and Asia.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $76.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, a decline of 3% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue decreased 2% from the year-ago period, with lower consumer asset-backed activity partially offset by improved issuance in commercial real estate finance. Structured finance revenue was down 4% outside the U.S., as reduced European derivatives issuance was partially offset by higher European securitization activity.
Global financial institutions revenue of $65.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 9% compared to the same quarter of 2009. Financial institutions revenue declined 10% in the U.S. and 8% outside the U.S., primarily reflecting lower banking sector activity in most regions.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $76.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, increasing 15% from the fourth quarter of 2009. U.S. revenue grew 20%, reflecting gains in most sectors. Outside the U.S. revenue rose 6%, mostly driven by growth in Asia.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics for the fourth quarter of 2010 reached $181.6 million, 18% above the prior-year period, primarily driven by the delivery of risk management software projects and professional services engagements. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $109.2 million increased 3% and risk management software revenue of $57.9 million grew 37 percent. Professional services revenue of $14.5 million increased 154%, including revenue from the acquisition of CSI Global Education announced on November 22, 2010. Revenue totaled $70.6 million in the U.S. and $111.0 million outside the U.S., up 7% and 26%, respectively, over the prior-year period.
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Expenses
Fourth quarter 2010 expense for Moodys Corporation of $367.7 million was 20% higher than in the prior-year period and reflected headcount increases and higher accruals for incentive compensation and profit sharing. The impact of foreign currency translation on fourth quarter expense was negligible. Moodys reported operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 34.8%.
Full-year 2010 expense for Moodys Corporation of $1,259.2 million was 13% higher than the prior year. Excluding restructuring-related items in 2009, Moodys 2010 expenses increased 15% over 2009.
Moodys effective tax rate was 19.5% for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with 38.3% for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits, lower state taxes and a larger portion of taxable income generated outside the U.S., which is taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rate. The annual effective tax rate for 2010 was 28.1% compared to 37.0% for 2009.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
On December 14, 2010, Moodys increased its quarterly dividend by 9.5% to 11.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Moodys repurchased 3.9 million shares at a total cost of $104 million and issued 0.4 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. For the full-year 2010, Moodys repurchased 8.6 million shares at a total cost of $224 million and issued 2.7 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2010 totaled 230.8 million, a 3% reduction from a year earlier. As of December 31, 2010, Moodys had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At year-end, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $660 million, an increase of $186 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2011
Moodys outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
For Moodys overall, the Company expects full-year 2011 revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 expenses are expected to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. Full-year 2011 operating margin is projected between 38% and 40% and the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 36 percent. Share repurchase is expected to continue at modest levels in 2011 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2011 in the range of $2.12 to $2.22.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2011 is expected to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is projected to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range. Structured finance revenue is expected to remain about flat. Revenue from financial institutions is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range, while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is projected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range.
For Moodys Analytics, full-year 2011 revenue is expected to increase in the high-single- to low-double-digit percent range. Revenue growth is expected in the mid-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics and in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range for risk management software. Professional services revenue is projected to more than double, primarily reflecting additional revenue from the acquisition of CSI Global Education. MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent range in the U.S. and in the low-double-digit percent range outside the U.S.
