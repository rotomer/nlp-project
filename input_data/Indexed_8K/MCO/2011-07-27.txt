Moodys Corporation Reports Results for Second Quarter 2011
2Q11 revenue of $605.2 million up 27% from 2Q10
Reported 2Q11 EPS of $0.82 up 61% from 2Q10
Raising FY 2011 EPS guidance to a range of $2.38 to $2.48 from previous range of $2.22 to $2.32
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2011--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the second quarter 2011.
Summary of Results for Second Quarter 2011
Moodys reported revenue of $605.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of 27% from $477.8 million for the second quarter of 2010. Operating income for the quarter was $270.1 million, a 42% increase from $190.5 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.82 for the second quarter of 2011 included a $0.03 legacy tax benefit and a $0.06 tax benefit resulting from a foreign tax ruling. Excluding legacy tax benefits from both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.79 for the quarter grew 61% from $0.49 in the prior year period.
"Moody's second quarter results reflected gains in all credit ratings areas, particularly for corporate debt, and continued strong performance from Moodys Analytics," said Raymond McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. "Based on second quarter performance, we are raising our full year 2011 EPS guidance to a range of $2.38 to $2.48; however, we expect more challenging debt issuance conditions in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2011 as compared to the first half of the year.
Second Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $605.2 million increased 27% from the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 23 percent. U.S. revenue of $315.0 million for the second quarter of 2011 increased 20% from the second quarter of 2010. Revenue generated outside the U.S. of $290.2 million rose 34% from the prior year period and represented 48% of Moodys total revenue for the quarter, up from 45% in the year-ago period.
Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the second quarter of 2011 was $438.0 million, an increase of 33% from the prior year period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 29 percent. U.S. revenue of $245.0 million for the second quarter of 2011 increased 26% from the second quarter of 2010. Outside the U.S., revenue of $193.0 million was up 44% from the year-ago period.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $200.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 increased 56% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting strong issuance in investment-grade and speculative-grade bond and bank loan markets. Corporate finance revenue grew 43% in the U.S. and 85% outside the U.S.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $86.3 million for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 18% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue grew 8% from the year-ago period, primarily due to growth in commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue increased 28%, primarily driven by higher issuance volumes in European asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, including covered bonds.
Global financial institutions revenue of $79.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 increased 25% compared to the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue rose 27%, primarily reflecting increased banking and insurance issuance from smaller-sized institutions, while non-U.S. revenue grew 24% with stronger banking activity in all regions.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $72.5 million for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 13% from the second quarter of 2010. U.S. revenue increased 7% from the prior year period, reflecting growth in infrastructure finance partially offset by continued weakness in public and project finance issuance. Non-U.S. revenue grew 25%, primarily due to gains in infrastructure and public finance.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the second quarter of 2011 was $167.2 million, up 12% from the second quarter of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $111.0 million increased by 6% from the prior year period, and risk management software revenue of $40.0 million grew 2 percent. Professional services revenue of $16.2 million more than tripled from the prior year period, reflecting both the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010 and strong results in the base business.
In the U.S., MA revenue of $70.0 million for the second quarter of 2011 grew 4% from the prior year period. Outside the U.S., revenue of $97.2 million was up 18% from the same quarter of 2010.
Second Quarter Expenses
Second quarter 2011 expenses for Moodys Corporation of $335.1 million were 17% greater than in the prior year period. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, expenses were up 13 percent. The growth was primarily due to increased headcount compared to the second quarter 2010, including from the acquisition of CSI Global Education in November 2010; and higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moodys profit sharing plan, reflecting the stronger full year outlook. Moodys reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2011 was 44.6%, compared to 39.9% in the second quarter of 2010.
Moodys effective tax rate was 27.8% for the second quarter of 2011, compared to 31.1% for the prior year period. The decline was due to lower taxes on foreign and state income and a favorable foreign tax ruling, partially offset by a smaller benefit in 2011 for legacy tax matters.
Year-to-Date Results
Moodys Corporation revenue for the first six months of 2011 totaled $1,182.3 million, an increase of 24% from $954.4 million for the same period of 2010. Excluding the positive impact of foreign currency translation, revenue growth was 22 percent. Expenses for the first six months of 2011 totaled $662.1 million, 17% higher than a year ago. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, expenses grew 14 percent. First half operating income of $520.2 million grew 34% from $387.3 million for the same period of 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Diluted earnings per share of $1.49 for the first half of 2011 included a $0.03 legacy tax benefit and a $0.06 tax benefit resulting from a foreign tax ruling. Excluding legacy tax benefits in both periods, diluted earnings per share of $1.46 for the first half of 2011 increased 51% from $0.97 in the prior year period.
Revenue at Moodys Investors Service totaled $850.6 million for the first six months of 2011, an increase of 28% from the same period in 2010. Moodys Analytics revenue rose 14% from the first half of 2010 to $331.7 million.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
During the second quarter of 2011, Moodys did not repurchase shares and issued 0.9 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2011 totaled 228.7 million, representing a 2.4% decline from a year earlier. As of June 30, 2011, Moodys had $1.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1.0 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2011, total cash and cash equivalents were $939 million, an increase of $453 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full Year 2011
Moodys outlook for 2011 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Moodys is revising its guidance for the full year 2011 to reflect stronger than expected second quarter performance, partially offset by expectations for more challenging debt issuance conditions in the U.S. and Europe as compared to the first half of the year. Moodys guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
For Moodys overall, the Company now expects full year 2011 revenue to grow in the low-teens percent range. Revenue expectations for certain areas have changed based on conditions specific to those businesses and geographies. Full year 2011 expenses are now projected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Full year 2011 operating margin is still projected to be between 38% and 40%, reflecting our expectation that strong first half performance will be offset by planned expense increases and lower revenue in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half. The effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 33 percent. Share repurchase is expected to resume in the second half of 2011, subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company now expects diluted earnings per share for full year 2011 in the range of $2.38 to $2.48.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2011 is now expected to increase in the low-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now projected to grow in the low-twenties percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now forecast to increase in the mid-twenties percent range. Revenue from structured finance and financial institutions are each now forecast to increase in the high-single-digit percent range, while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to be about flat with the prior year.
For Moodys Analytics, full year 2011 revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics and in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range for risk management software. Professional services revenue is still projected to more than double, primarily reflecting revenue from the late 2010 acquisition of CSI Global Education and very strong performance in the risk management advisory business. MA revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range in the U.S., and is still expected to grow in the low-double-digit percent range outside the U.S.
