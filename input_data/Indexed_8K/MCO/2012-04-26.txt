Moodys Corporation Reports Results for First Quarter 2012
1Q12 revenue of $646.8 million up 12% from 1Q11
Reported 1Q12 EPS of $0.76 up 13% from 1Q11
Reaffirming FY 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72; expecting to be toward the upper end of the range
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2012--Moodys Corporation (NYSE: MCO) today announced results for the first quarter 2012.
Summary of Results for First Quarter 2012
Moodys reported revenue of $646.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 as compared to $577.1 million for the first quarter of 2011. Operating income for the quarter was $269.0 million, an 8% increase from $250.1 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.76 for the first quarter of 2012.
"Moodys delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting increased corporate and public, project and infrastructure debt issuance as well as continued solid performance from Moodys Analytics," said Raymond McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Moodys. While the level of activity was strong in the first quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range.
First Quarter Revenue
For Moodys Corporation overall, global revenue of $646.8 million for the first quarter of 2012 was up 12% from the first quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue of $344.0 million for the first quarter of 2012 increased 14% from the first quarter of 2011, while revenue generated outside the U.S. of $302.8 million increased 10% from the prior-year period. Global revenue for Moodys Investors Service (MIS) for the first quarter of 2012 was $452.7 million, an increase of 10% from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $259.2 million for the first quarter of 2012 increased 13% from the first quarter of 2011. Outside the U.S., revenue of $193.5 million increased 6% from the year-ago period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by $4.4 million.
Within MIS, global corporate finance revenue of $200.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 was up 10% from the same quarter of 2011, reflecting stronger investment grade and solid speculative grade bond issuance activity. Corporate finance revenue increased 8% in the U.S. and 15% outside the U.S.
Global structured finance revenue totaled $94.3 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 5% from a year earlier. U.S. structured finance revenue grew 15% from the year-ago period, primarily due to strength in asset-backed securities and commercial real estate. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue was down 2%, reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European asset-backed securities in the first quarter of 2012 as well as demand in the first quarter of 2011 for ratings of outstanding securitizations placed with European government-sponsored facilities.
Global financial institutions revenue of $78.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 increased 2% compared to the prior-year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was essentially flat, while non-U.S. revenue grew 4 percent.
Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $79.1 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 23% from the first quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 37% from the prior-year period, primarily due to gains in public and project finance, while non-U.S. revenue grew 4 percent.
Global revenue for Moodys Analytics (MA) for the first quarter of 2012 was $194.1 million, up 18% from the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Revenue from research, data and analytics of $119.5 million increased by 9% from the prior-year period, primarily due to increased sales of credit research and related data. Revenue from enterprise risk solutions, formerly risk management software, of $48.1 million was up 11% over the prior-year period. Professional services revenue of $26.5 million more than doubled from the prior-year period, reflecting both the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011 and organic growth in MAs training and education business.
In the U.S., MA revenue of $84.8 million for the first quarter of 2012 increased 19% from the prior-year period. Outside the U.S., revenue of $109.3 million grew 17% as compared with the same quarter of 2011.
First Quarter Expenses
First quarter 2012 expenses for Moodys Corporation were $377.8 million, 16% higher than in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased headcount as well as non-compensation costs related to technology and acquisitions that closed in late 2011. Moodys reported operating margin for the first quarter of 2012 was 41.6%, down from 43.3% in the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation on first quarter expenses was negligible.
Moodys effective tax rate was 32.1% for the first quarter of 2012, compared with 33.2% for the prior-year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits derived from international tax initiatives and tax audit settlements partially offset by miscellaneous discrete items.
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
During the first quarter of 2012, Moodys did not repurchase any shares, but issued 2.6 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2012 totaled 224.7 million, representing a 1% decline from a year earlier. As of March 31, 2012, Moodys had $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. At quarter-end, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1.0 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end were $814.7 million, an increase of $95.2 million from a year earlier.
Assumptions and Outlook for Full-Year 2012
Moodys outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates.
Moodys is reaffirming its EPS guidance for the full-year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72; however, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moodys overall, the Company now expects full-year 2012 revenue to grow in the low-double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 expenses are now projected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39 percent. The effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33 percent. The Company still expects diluted earnings per share for full-year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expects to be toward the upper end of the range.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now forecasted to grow in the low-double-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is now expected to be flat to slightly up, while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For MA, full-year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range both inside and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single-digit percent range for research, data and analytics and in the low 20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting growth in the core business as well as the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 80%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in MAs existing training and education businesses.
