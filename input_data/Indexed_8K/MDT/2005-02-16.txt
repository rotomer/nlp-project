MEDTRONIC ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER REVENUE AND NET EARNINGS INCREASES OF 15 PERCENT AND 17 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY
 Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT) today announced that third-quarter revenues increased 15 percent to $2.531 billion over the $2.194 billion of the comparable period one year ago.  Reflecting the weaker dollar, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on quarterly revenue of $59.3 million compared to the third fiscal quarter of last year.  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, the company recorded a $24.3 million charge related to a legal judgment, and during the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, the company recorded a required $22.0 million in-process research and development charge related to an acquisition.  Excluding charges taken in the third quarter of the current and prior year, net earnings and diluted earnings per share grew 15 percent to $559.7 million and $0.46 per diluted share.  Actual as-reported quarterly net earnings were $544.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, an increase of 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively, over the $463.9 million in net earnings and $0.38 per diluted share recorded in the third quarter one year ago.
