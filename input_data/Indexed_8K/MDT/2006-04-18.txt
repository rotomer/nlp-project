Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 12, 2006, Medtronic, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which it agreed to sell $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes") the Initial Purchasers named therein (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). The Purchase Agreement also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to cover overallotments. On April 13, 2006, the Initial Purchasers exercised the aforementioned option in whole. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, are expected to be approximately $4.329 billion. A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Purchase Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on April 18, 2006. The Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), issuable in certain circumstances upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The 2011 Notes are governed by an indenture dated as of April 18, 2006 (the "2011 Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the 2011 Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the descriptions of the 2011 Indenture and the 2011 Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the 2011 Indenture and 2011 Notes, respectively. The 2013 Notes are governed by an indenture dated as of April 18, 2006 (the "2013 Indenture" and, together with the 2011 Indenture, the "Indentures"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of the 2013 Indenture are described in the Schedule to Exhibit 4.1 and are incorporated herein by reference; the descriptions of the 2013 Indenture and the 2013 Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by such description.
 
The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, commercial banking, corporate trust, financial advisory services and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company. They have received customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
The 2011 Notes will be convertible into cash and, at the option of the Company, shares of Common Stock, based on a conversion rate of 17.8113 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $56.14 per share), and the 2013 Notes will be convertible into cash and, at the option of the Company, shares of Common Stock, based on a conversion rate of 17.8113 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $56.14 per share) (each subject to adjustment) and only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing price of the Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 140% of the applicable conversion price per share; (2) if specified distributions to holders of the Common Stock are made or certain corporate transactions occur, as set forth in the Indentures, respectively; and (3) during the last month prior to maturity of the applicable Notes. Upon conversion, a holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) the principal amount of the Note or (ii) the conversion value, determined in the manner set forth in the Indentures. If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the Note on the conversion date, the Company will also deliver, at its election, cash or Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock having a value calculated as set forth in the Indentures.
The 2011 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year and the 2013 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.625% per year, in each case payable semiannually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2006. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes will mature on April 15, 2011 and 2013, respectively.
The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control, as defined in the applicable Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
 
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Company's senior credit facilities, Series B Contingent Convertible Debentures due 2021, Senior Notes, Series B due 2010 and Senior Notes, Series B due 2015. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness and effectively are subordinated in right of payment to all of its subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and are subordinated in right of payment to its secured obligations to the extent of the assets securing such obligation.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of April 18, 2006, with the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective within 270 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective for a period of two years after the closing of the offering of the Notes or until the earliest of (i) the sale or transfer pursuant to a shelf registration statement of all of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, (ii) the date the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have been or may be sold or transferred to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act and (iii) such Notes and Common Stock shall have ceased to be outstanding. The Company will be required to pay additional interest, subject to some limitations, to the holders of the Notes if it fails to comply with its obligation to register the Notes and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "Options") with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman, Sachs & Co., UBS AG, London Branch (represented by UBS Securities LLC as its agent) and Merrill Lynch International (represented by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as its agent) (the "Dealers"). The Options cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 164.6 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of approximately $56.14. The Company paid an aggregate amount of approximately $1.07 billion of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Options.
The Company also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby the Company sold to the Dealers warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 82.3 million shares of Common Stock (the "Warrants") at a strike price of approximately $76.56 per share of Common Stock. Half of the Warrants will be exercisable and will expire on July 25, 2011 and half will be exercisable and will expire on July 24, 2013. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $560 million from the sale of the Warrants.
 
The Options and Warrants are separate contracts entered into by the Company with the Dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. The Options are expected to offset potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the Options, which is equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to certain adjustments that correspond to adjustments to the conversion price of the Notes.
If the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the Options, the Options entitle the Company to receive from the Dealers net shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, depending on the consideration paid on the underlying Notes, based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Options. Additionally, if the market price of the Common Stock at the time of exercise of the Warrants exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Company will owe the Dealers net shares of Common Stock or cash in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Warrants.
The Warrants and the underlying Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
On April 13, 2006, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement to repurchase shares of Common Stock through a purchase agreement between the Company and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"). The agreement allows the Company to repurchase the shares immediately, while Citibank will purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over time. The initial price per share was $51.04. The Company will receive or be required to remit a price adjustment based upon the price of the Common Stock during that period. The purchase price adjustment is expected to be settled in June 2006.
Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On April 18, 2006, the Company issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes and $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes. The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
 
The 2011 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year and the 2013 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.625% per year, in each case payable semiannually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2006. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes will mature on April 15, 2011 and 2013, respectively.
The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control as defined in the applicable Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of their Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Notes and the underlying Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Any failure of the Company to send such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
     (e) With respect to the amendments set forth in Section 9.01 and this Section 9.02, any such amendment to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency made solely to conform the Indenture to the provisions of the description of the Notes as set forth in any final offering memorandum (relating to the initial issuance of such Notes to the extent that such description provisions are intended to be a verbatim recitation of terms applicable to the Notes) will be deemed not to adversely affect the interests of the Holders.

The
 
Trustee may also place an appropriate notation on any Note thereafter authenticated. However, the effectiveness of the amendment, supplement or waiver is not affected by any failure to annotate or exchange Notes in this fashion.
     Section 9.04The Trustee is entitled to receive, and will be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by the Indenture. If the Trustee has received such an Opinion of Counsel, it shall sign the amendment, supplement or waiver so long as the same does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee.

Upon conversion of a Note, a Noteholder will not receive, except as described below, any Cash payment representing accrued interest. Instead, accrued interest will be deemed paid by the Cash and/or shares of common stock, if any, received by the Noteholder upon conversion. Delivery to the Noteholder of such Cash and/or shares of Common Stock will thus be deemed (1) to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a Note, and (2) to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Note. As a result, upon conversion of a Note, accrued and unpaid interest on such Note is deemed paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
     (d) Holders of Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the Close of Business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business of such Interest Payment Date will receive the semiannual interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion, and such Notes upon surrender must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of such payment; that no such payment need be made (x) in connection with any conversion following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date, (y) if the Company has specified a Change in Control Purchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date or (z) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any Defaulted Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.

     (e) If the Holder converts more than one Note at the same time, the Required Cash Amount and the Remaining Shares, if any (together with the Cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) shall be based on the total principal amount of the Notes converted.
     (f) If the last day on which a Note may be converted is a Legal Holiday, the Note may be surrendered on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.
 
     (g) Upon surrender of a Note that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Note surrendered.
     Section 10.03The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Note.

However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.

     All shares of Common Stock delivered upon payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
     The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of Notes, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
 
     In addition, if any shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares of Common Stock may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will cause such shares of Common Stock to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be.

     (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
plus
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date.
     If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.06(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.06(a).
     (b) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, if the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased. In each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision or combination and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination. Such increase or reduction, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
     Section 10.07If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute rights to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:
. Adjustment for Rights Issue.
     (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for purchase; and
plus
     (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the declaration date for such distribution (determined by multiplying such total number of shares of Common Stock so offered by the exercise price of such rights and dividing the product so obtained by such Current Market Price).
plus
     Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or upon the expiration or termination of such rights, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not occurred. In determining whether any rights entitle the holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights and the value of such consideration if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Except as set forth in this paragraph, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07.
 
     Section 10.08
. Adjustment for Other Distributions.
     (a) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock any of its Capital Stock, assets, or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (excluding (x) any distribution of Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company referred to in Section 10.08(b) below, (y) any rights described in Section 10.07 above and (z) any cash dividends or other cash distributions referred to in Section 10.09 below) (such Capital Stock, assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company being distributed hereinafter in this Section 10.08 called the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:
Distributed Assets
     (i) the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, and
     (ii) the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus the fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors, of the portion of Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of the Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Ex-Dividend Date).
     Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. Except as set forth in the prior sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.08(a).
     If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.08(a) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "") used in computing the Current Market Price for purposes of clause (i) above, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders.
Reference Period
 
     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Distributed Assets distributed by the Company to all holders of the Common Stock consist of Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the fifteenth Trading Day following the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:
Spin-Off
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend for such distribution on the New York Stock Exchange or such other national or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted, (B) the average Closing Prices of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after such Ex-Dividend Date; and
plus
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after such Ex-Dividend Date,
such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the fifteenth Trading Day following the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.08(b).
     Section 10.09If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of Common Stock, Cash (excluding (x) any distributions described in Section 10.10 below or (y) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business of the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:
. Adjustment for Cash Dividends.
     (x) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock the Dividend Threshold Amount; and
minus
     (y) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such date, less the amount of the distribution per share of Common Stock.
 
     Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted hereunder or under the Notes, the Dividend Threshold Amount shall be increased or decreased by multiplying the Dividend Threshold Amount at such time by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate following such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Rate may be increased or decreased pursuant to the application of this Section 10.09.
     Section 10.10In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Notes are outstanding, distribute Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock, where the sum of the aggregate amount of such Cash distributed and the aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), as of the Expiration Date (as defined below), of such other consideration distributed (such sum, the "") expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer as of the Expiration Time (as defined below) (such tendered or exchanged shares of Common Stock, the "") exceeds the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the last date (such last date, the "") on which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (as the same may be amended through the Expiration Date), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date by a fraction:

Expiration Time
 
     (y) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Expiration Time (including all Purchased Shares) and (B) the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.
An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.10 shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Company or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 10.10 to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.10.
     Section 10.11. Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under Section 10.08, except as set forth in Section 10.23. If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof), except as set forth in Section 10.23. In addition, except as set forth in Section 10.23, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate
Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Rate.
Trigger Event
 
under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 10.23), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
     Section 10.12If any of the following events (any such event, a "") occurs:
. Disposition Events.
Disposition Event
     (a) any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination);
     (b) any merger, consolidation or other combination involving the Company; or
     (c) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person;
in each case, as a result of which all of the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive Cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture, if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.01, and subject to the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Notes, the Conversion Value with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted following the effective date of any Disposition Event, shall be calculated based on the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property (collectively, "") received upon the occurrence of such Disposition Event by a holder of Common Stock holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Disposition Event; that if the Disposition Event provides the holders of Common Stock with the right to receive more than a single type of consideration determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the Reference Property shall be comprised of the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock.
Reference Property
provided
 
     If the Conversion Value of the Notes shall be based on Reference Property as set forth above, the Company's obligation to deliver the consideration described in Section 10.01 with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion after the effective date of any such Disposition Event, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 10.01, be settled in Cash and units of Reference Property (if applicable) and the Company shall deliver, as promptly as practicable immediately following the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period:
     (1) Cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) $1,000 and (B) the Conversion Value, and
     (2) if the Conversion Value is greater than $1,000, (a) Cash equal to the difference between the aggregate Conversion Value and $1,000, (b) an amount in Reference Property, determined as set forth in Section 10.01(b), with a fair market value, as determined by the Conversion Agent, equal to the Conversion Value less $1,000 or (c) a combination thereof, at the Company's election, determined as set forth in Section 10.01(b); and
     (3) an amount in Cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock calculated based on the Average Price,
that, in each case, (x) the Conversion Value and the Daily Share Amounts, shall be determined as if the words "Volume Weighted Average Price per share of Common Stock" in the definition of each such term were replaced by the words "Volume Weighted Average Price per unit of Reference Property composed of the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Disposition Event would have owned or been entitled to receive", (y) the Volume Weighted Average Price shall be determined with respect to such a unit of Reference Property and (z) references to "Remaining Shares" and "shares of Common Stock" were instead references to "a unit of Reference Property composed of the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Disposition Event would have owned or been entitled to receive."
provided
     Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 10. If, in the case of any such Disposition Event, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a Person other than the successor
 
or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such Disposition Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Noteholders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
     The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at the address of such Noteholder as it appears on the register of the Notes maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     The above provisions of this Section 10.12 shall similarly apply to successive Disposition Events.
If this Section 10.12 applies to any event or occurrence, none of Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 shall apply.
     Section 10.13(a) If, after the Issue Date, a Change in Control occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Change in Control, the Company will increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 10.13. A conversion of Notes will be deemed for the purposes of this Section 10.13 to be "in connection with" a Change in Control transaction if the notice of conversion of the Notes is received by the Conversion Agent from and including the effective date of the Change in Control transaction up to and including the Trading Day prior to the related Change in Control Purchase Date.
. Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Change in Control Transactions.
Make-Whole Shares
     (b) The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control (in the case of a change in control described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof), or in the case of all other Changes in Control, the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the relevant Change in Control Effective Date (the ""). If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the case of a Change in Control described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the Stock Price shall be the Cash amount paid per share of Common Stock. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the relevant Change in Control Effective Date.
Change in Control Effective Date
Stock Price
 
     (c) The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. In addition, the number of Make-Whole Shares on the table below will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.06 through Section 10.10.
     (d) If the exact Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates are not set forth in the table, then: (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Change in Control Effective Date is between two Change in Control Effective Dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Notes will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Change in Control Effective Dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, (ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $110 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes; and (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $51.04 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes.
     (e) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10 as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the Notes a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     Section 10.14No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate shall be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment. In addition, the Company shall make any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected on each anniversary of the Issue Date, upon conversion of any Note, upon required purchase of the notes pursuant to Section 3.01, and five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
. When Adjustment May Be Deferred.
     Section 10.15(a) No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 if Noteholders participate, without conversion, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to such Section at the same time as holders of the Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event and on the same terms as holders of the Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event as if Noteholders, at such time, held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate at such time.
. When No Adjustment Required.
 
     (b) No adjustment need be made for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase Common Stock or any such security.
     (c) No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.
     (d) No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
     (e) To the extent the Notes become convertible pursuant to this Article 10 into Cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the Cash. Interest will not accrue on the Cash.
     (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary, the Conversion Rate shall not exceed 19.5924 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, other than on account of adjustments to the Conversion Rate in the manner set forth in Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 and Section 10.10.
     Section 10.16Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Noteholders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and a certificate from the Company's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
. Notice of Adjustment.
     Section 10.17If (a) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10 (unless no adjustment is to occur pursuant to Section 10.14 or Section 10.15), (b) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 10.12, or (c) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, then the Company shall mail to Noteholders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice stating the proposed Ex-Dividend Date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall file and mail the notice at least 15 days before such date; that if the Company elects to make a distribution described in Section 10.07, Section 10.08, or Section 10.09, and in the case of Section 10.08 or Section 10.09,

These calculations include, but are not limited to, Conversion Value, the Conversion Date, the Volume Weighted Average Price, the Conversion Reference Period, the Closing Price, the Conversion Price, the Required Cash Amount, the Applicable Conversion Rate and the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, to be issued upon conversion of the Notes. The Company shall make all these calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, the Company's calculations will be final and binding on Noteholders. The Company shall provide a schedule of the Company's calculations to the Trustee, and the Trustee is entitled to rely upon the accuracy of the Company's calculations without independent verification.
. Company Determination Final.
     Section 10.20The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article 10 should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 10.12 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct. The Trustee shall not be accountable for and makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Notes. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article 10. Each Conversion Agent shall have the same protection under this Section 10.20 as the Trustee.
. Trustee's Adjustment Disclaimer.
     Section 10.21(a) For purposes of Section 10.08, Section 10.06(a) and Section 10.07, any dividend or distribution to which Section 10.08 is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the debt securities, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.08 with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section

     (b) The reclassification of the Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon an event to which Section 10.12 applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than the Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be the "Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of this Section 10.08), and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 10.06(b)).
     Section 10.22After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Article 10, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Article 10 shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.

In order to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or such Prospectus, as applicable, each Holder must no later than 20 days following notice by the Company of such filing, furnish in writing the completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request in writing, if any, to the Company and the Company will include the information from the completed Questionnaire and such other information, if any, in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as necessary and in a manner, so that upon effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement the Holder will be permitted to deliver the Prospectus to purchasers of the Holder's Registrable Securities.

Holders that do not deliver a completed written Questionnaire and such other information, as provided for in this Section 2.1(c), will not be named as selling securityholders in the Prospectus.

The Company represents that any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by it or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder will not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus and, any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          The Company agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder or by the instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company, or to the extent the Company does not reasonably object, as reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers with respect to information relating to such Initial Purchasers or by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders covered by such Shelf Registration Statement with respect to information relating to such Holders, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its is used or filed with the SEC.

In the event that (a) a Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective by the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline, (b) after the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective, subject to Section 2.5, the Shelf Registration Statement fails to be effective or usable by the Holders without being succeeded within seven business days by a post-effective amendment or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act that cures the failure to be effective or usable or (c) the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable by the Holders for any reason, and the number of days for which the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be usable exceeds any Suspension Period permitted by Section 2.5 hereunder (each such event being a ""), additional interest, as liquidated damages (""), will accrue at a rate per annum of 0.125% of the principal amount of the Notes then remaining for the first 90-day period from the day following the Registration Default, and thereafter at a rate per annum of 0.25% of the principal amount of the Notes then remaining; , in no event shall Liquidated Damages accrue at a rate per annum exceeding 0.25% of the principal amount of the Notes then remaining; that no Liquidated Damages shall accrue after the second anniversary of the Closing Date; that Liquidated Damages shall not accrue under clause (b) and (c) above with respect to any Holder that (x) does not submit a properly completed Questionnaire and other information, if any, requested pursuant to Section 2.1(c) above, and (y) is not named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Liquidated Damages be payable in connection with a Registration Default relating to a failure to register the Common Stock into which the Notes are convertible; for the avoidance of doubt, if none of the Securities are registered then Liquidated Damages only will be payable in connection with the Registration Default relating to the failure to register the Notes. Upon the cure of all Registration Defaults then continuing, the accrual of Liquidated Damages will automatically cease and the interest rate borne by the Securities will revert to the original interest rate at such time. Liquidated Damages shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in each 90-day period in which the Shelf Registration Statement is not effective or is unusable. Holders who have converted Securities into Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any Liquidated Damages with respect to such Common Stock or the principal amount of the Notes converted.

Each Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company in writing all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not misleading, any other information regarding such Holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as may be required to be disclosed in the Prospectus or Shelf Registration Statement under applicable law or pursuant to SEC comments and any information otherwise reasonably required by the Company to comply with applicable law or regulations.
          Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event or the discovery of any facts, each of the kind described in Section 3(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(h) or written notice from the Company that the Shelf Registration Statement is again effective and no amendment or supplement is needed, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies in such Holder's possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

     in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (d) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 4, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (1) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (2) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 4 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel), reasonably approved by the indemnifying party, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
provided, however
     (e) . The indemnifying party under this Section 4 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party
Settlements
 
shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 4(d) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (f) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative fault of the indemnifying parties on the one hand and the indemnified parties and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, or by the Holders or the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, the Holders and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Initial Purchaser or Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such Initial Purchaser or Holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser or Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 4, each director, officer, employee and agent of any Initial Purchaser or Holder, or each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

14 clause (i) only, in so far as it relates to a suspension or limitation of trading in the Company's securities, or if the sale to the Initial Purchasers of the Securities on the Closing Date is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or to comply with any provision hereof, the Company agrees to reimburse the Representatives and the other Initial Purchasers (or such Initial Purchasers as have terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves), severally, upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses that shall have been reasonably incurred by the Representatives and the Initial Purchasers in connection with the proposed purchase and the offering and sale of the Securities, including but not limited to fees and disbursements of counsel, printing expenses, travel expenses, postage, facsimile and telephone charges.

Indemnification
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its directors, officers and employees, agents, and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (i) against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Initial Purchaser or such controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the Disclosure Package, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; (subject to Section 11(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (iii) against any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above; and to reimburse each Initial Purchaser, its officers, directors, employees, agents and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and
Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers.
provided that
 
disbursements of counsel chosen by the Initial Purchasers) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser, its officers, directors, employees, agents or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 11(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however,
     (b) Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the Disclosure Package, or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the Disclosure Package, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Initial Purchasers have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the Disclosure Package are the statements set forth
Indemnification of the Company, its Directors and Officers.
 
in Schedule C. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 11(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 11 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 11, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 11 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel), reasonably approved by the indemnifying party (or by the Representatives in the case of Section 11(b)), representing the indemnified parties who are
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
provided, however,
 
parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
     (d) The indemnifying party under this Section 11 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 11(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements.
     12. If the indemnification provided for in Section 11 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and
Contribution.
 
the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
     The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 12 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 12.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 12, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission received by such Initial Purchaser in connection with the Securities purchased by it hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 12, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
     13. If, on the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such failure or refusal occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such failure or refusal, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party (other than a defaulting Initial Purchaser) to any other party except that the provisions of Section 7(k), Section 10, Section 11 and Section 12 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers.
     As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 13. Any action taken under this Section 13 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.
     14. On or prior to the Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any federal or New York authority or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United
Termination of this Agreement.
 
States has occurred; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Final Offering Memorandum or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 14 shall be without liability on the part of (b) the Company to any Initial Purchaser, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Sections 7(k) and 10 hereof or (c) any Initial Purchaser to the Company.
     15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Initial Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Initial Purchaser has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement or agreements described in the Offering Memorandum; (iv) the several Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.
The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
     16. The respective indemnities, contribution, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Initial
Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.
 
Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the result hereof, made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Company or any of its or their partners, officers, directors, employees, agents or any controlling person, as the case may be, (ii) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
