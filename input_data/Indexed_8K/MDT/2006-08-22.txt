 Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE:MDT) today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2007 ended July 28, 2006.
MINNEAPOLIS  August 22, 2006
Medtronic recorded first quarter fiscal year 2007 revenue of $2.897 billion, an 8 percent increase over the $2.690 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $6 million this quarter. As reported, first quarter fiscal year 2007 net earnings were $599 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $321 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the same period last year, representing growth of 87 percent and 96 percent, respectively. Adjusted first quarter 2007 net earnings were $639 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net earnings of $584 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for the same period last year, representing an increase of 9 percent and 15 percent, respectively. As detailed in the attached table, adjusted net earnings for these periods (1) excludes the impact of a certain litigation charge of $40 million in first quarter 2007, (2) excludes the impact of purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $295 million in the first quarter 2006 and (3) includes incremental SFAS No. 123(R) stock-based compensation expense of $32 million in first quarter 2006.
"Strong performances in Medtronic's Spinal, Vascular, Neurological and Diabetes businesses helped offset weakness in the U.S. implantable defibrillator market during the quarter," said Art Collins, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer. "We are encouraged by the strength of our new product pipeline, and we continue to make investments in R&D, market development and operating infrastructure to support future growth."
Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management Business
Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management (CRDM) reported first quarter revenue of $1.250 billion, representing a decrease of 1 percent over the same period last fiscal year.
 
ICD revenue of $673 million was down 6 percent, driven principally by a decline in the growth of the U.S. ICD market. The Company believes the ICD market remains significantly under penetrated and that several factors contributed to last quarter's unanticipated decline. Medtronic expects the ICD market to reaccelerate as a result of a number of initiatives it is undertaking to both increase market share and spur market growth in the U.S. ICD market.
ICD revenue outside the United States was strong, growing 21 percent over the prior year quarter and Medtronic's worldwide market share for ICDs was flat over the same period last fiscal year. Worldwide pacing revenue of $460 million grew 3 percent. Worldwide market share for pacemakers was up over 2 percentage points. Medtronic's Emergency Response Systems business reported revenue of $101 million, a 16 percent revenue increase over the same period last fiscal year.
