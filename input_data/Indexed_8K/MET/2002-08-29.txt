(NYSE: MET) announced today that its subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and plaintiffs' counsel for the class have reached a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit concerning alleged race-based underwriting in the sale of certain life insurance policies from 1901 through 1972. The settlement, which has received preliminary approval from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, must receive final approval by the court before it can be implemented. A fairness hearing has been set for February 7, 2003. MetLife simultaneously is entering into a settlement agreement with the New York State Insurance Department that will resolve the Department's examination concerning race-based underwriting practices. If approved by the court, the settlement would provide benefits to current and former African-American and other non-Caucasian policyholders and certain beneficiaries of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company industrial and certain ordinary life insurance policies issued from 1901 through 1972. Benefits may also be paid to family members of deceased policyholders. On February 7, 2002, the company announced that it established a reserve to cover costs associated with the anticipated resolution of the class-action lawsuit and a regulatory inquiry into race-based underwriting practices. The company believes that the previously established reserve is adequate to cover the costs associated with resolving these matters. "The settlement addresses policies that were issued decades ago amid circumstances that are no longer prevailing today," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer. "MetLife prides itself on providing the best products and services to all of our customers. As we examined the limited records available in this case, we determined it to be appropriate with respect to certain policies to make adjustments and payments as provided in the settlement." "When many other life insurers in the first half of the 20th century refused to sell to African Americans, MetLife sold policies that performed as promised. In fact, regardless of race, policy benefits often significantly exceeded premiums paid over the life of the policy - in many cases, by multiples of two or three," explained Mr. Benmosche. "Beginning in 1948, the company equalized the benefits of certain rated policies, bringing them to the same level offered by policies issued with a better risk classification. The proposed settlement extends and expands upon the equalization program that MetLife began in 1948." "We are proud of the wide diversity that exists among our customer base. It is my view that it is in the best interest of our company to put this matter behind us," said Mr. Benmosche. The settlement includes all policyholders and certain beneficiaries of certain policies that insured non-Caucasians: industrial life policies issued from 1901 through 1964 with face amounts less than $1,000; ordinary policies issued from 1901 through 1972 with less-than-standard risk
classifications; and, Metropolitan Series policies issued from 1960 through 1972 with face amounts between $4,500 and $5,000. Three types of relief are available as a result of the settlement depending on the type of policy and its current status. They include an increased policy death benefit, cash payment or a special settlement death benefit.
