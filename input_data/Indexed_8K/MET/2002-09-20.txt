Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure On September 19, 2002, Fitch Ratings lowered its insurer financial strength and debt ratings of MetLife, Inc. and certain affiliated companies and assigned debt ratings to two affiliated companies. Fitch Ratings said that the changes in ratings were a result of its comprehensive industry review of all North American life insurance groups in light of its belief that recent adverse performance within the investment markets required an accelerated recognition of certain industry trends that have been negatively impacting life insurers.

Fitch Ratings reported that MetLife's Rating Outlook is Stable.
