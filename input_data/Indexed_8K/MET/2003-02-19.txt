Best & Co. or any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt security or the financial strength or the claims paying ability of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; (k) On or after the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agents, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed Remarketing of the Debentures, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iv) a suspension or material limitation in clearing and/or settlement in securities generally; (v) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; or (vi) the material outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or any other national or international calamity or emergency (including without limitation as a result of an act of terrorism) if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (vi) in the judgment of the Remarketing Agents makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the remarketing of the Debentures being delivered on the Remarketing Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectus; (l) The Company shall have complied with any request by the Remarketing Agents with respect to the furnishing of copies of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, in compliance with the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof; 15
(m) At the Remarketing Closing Date, the Remarketing Agents shall have received a certificate of the Company, dated as of the Remarketing Closing Date, to the effect that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2 hereof are true and correct in all respects with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of Remarketing Closing Date and (ii) the Company has complied in all respects with all agreements and all conditions on its part to be performed under this Remarketing Agreement at or prior to the Remarketing Closing Date; and (n) Debevoise & Plimpton, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agents their written opinion, dated the Remarketing Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Remarketing Agents, with respect to the incorporation of the Company and the validity of the Debentures being delivered on the Remarketing Closing Date. Such opinion shall also state that the statements set forth in the Final Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they purport to describe matters of law or legal conclusions, are correct in all material respects." 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) the failure to have an effective Registration Statement relating to the Debentures or the failure to satisfy the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 Act because the Company failed to provide the Remarketing Agents with a Final Prospectus for delivery, or (ii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any other prospectus relating to the Debentures, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iv) the remarketing of the Debentures or the establishment of the Reset Rate, as the case may be, or the engagement of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents pursuant to, or the performance by the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents of their respective services contemplated by, this Remarketing Agreement; and will reimburse each Remarketing Agent and each Reset Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that (I) the Company shall not be liable under clause (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus, any other prospectus relating to the Debentures, or any such amendment or supplement(s) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Remarketing Agent or such Reset Agent, as the case may be, expressly for use in the Final Prospectus and (II) the Company shall not be liable under clause (a)(iv) to the extent such liability is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be; provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Remarketing Agent under this Section 6(a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction has found by final and nonappealable order that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Remarketing Agent results from the fact that such Remarketing Agent sold Debentures to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (it being understood that if at the time of any such claim such Remarketing Agent shall certify that it has sent or given the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented to any person making such claim at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, it shall be presumed that such Final Prospectus has been so sent or given unless the Company shall have sustained the burden of proving, in a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable order, that the facts are otherwise), if (i) such delivery to such person is required by Section 5 of the Act, (ii) the Company has furnished copies of such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented to such Remarketing Agent a reasonable period of 16
time prior to such Remarketing Agent being required so to deliver such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented and (iii) the untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected by such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented. (b) Each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any other prospectus relating to the Debentures, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any other prospectus relating to the Debentures, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents on the other from the remarketing of the Debentures to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is 17
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such remarketing (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the aggregate fees actually received by such Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents under Section 4 hereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents, as the case may be, on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent shall be required to contribute any amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds the aggregate fees received by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent in connection with the Remarketing under Section 4 of this Remarketing Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective remarketing and reset obligations with respect to the Debentures and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agent. The Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents may resign and be discharged from their duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent; provided that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, and such successor Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. In any such case, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement. 8. Dealing in the Remarketed Debentures. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Debentures. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Debentures may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. 18
9. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Remarketing Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents shall be read into this Remarketing Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement or the Declaration. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents, as the case may be, each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it which purports to conform to the requirements of this Remarketing Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement or the Declaration as to the truth of the statements expressed in any such documents. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. Neither the Remarketing Agents nor the Reset Agents shall have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Debentures or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Debentures, and they shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide on or prior to the Business Day before the Remarketing Date or the applicable Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. None of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents, acting under this Remarketing Agreement, shall incur any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company or its respective security holders or creditors or to any beneficial owner or holder of Remarketed Debentures in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, relating to or arising out of the engagement of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to, or the performance by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent of their respective services contemplated by, this Remarketing Agreement or for any action or failure to act in connection with the Remarketing (or any Subsequent Remarketing, in the event of a Failed Remarketing) or otherwise, except to the extent such liability is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be. Each of the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase Remarketed Debentures for its own account. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive any termination of this Remarketing Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent notwithstanding their resignation or removal. 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate as to any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent which is replaced on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the obligations of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time on the Remarketing Date (or any Subsequent Remarketing Date, in the event of a Failed Remarketing) if, prior to that time, any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur. 11. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 10 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, each former Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of such Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent or any controlling person of any such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Debentures. 12.

All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication; notices to the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents shall be directed to (i) Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 and (ii) Goldman Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004, with a copy to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York 10036, attention of Susan J.

No purchaser of any of the Debentures pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS REMARKETING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 15. Consent to Jurisdiction. The Company agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent or by any person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, arising out of or based upon this Remarketing Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any state or Federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding. 16.

In particular, each Remarketing Agent severally represents and agrees as set forth in Annex III to this Remarketing Agreement. 17. Counterparts. This Remarketing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 20
