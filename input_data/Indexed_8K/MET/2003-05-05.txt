EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Exhibit - ------- ------- 99.1 Press Release, dated May 5, 2003. 99.2 Quarterly Financial Supplement for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Kevin Helmintoller (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2003 RESULTS NEW YORK, May 5, 2003 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported first quarter 2003 net income of $362 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with $329 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2002. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 includes after-tax net investment losses of $84 million. First quarter 2002 net income includes after-tax net investment losses of $76 million and income of $5 million from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill. As a result of the conversion of MetLife Capital Trust I's company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities into long-term debt, $21 million ($0.03 per diluted share) was charged to additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2003 and is included in the calculation of net income per share. See "Corporate Events" within this release for additional information related to MetLife Capital Trust I. MetLife analyzes its performance using a non-GAAP measure called operating earnings. Operating earnings is defined as net income, excluding after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. MetLife believes this measure enhances the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2003 were $446 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared with $400 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Total premiums and fees for the first quarter of 2003 were $5.40 billion, up 9% from the prior year period. Total assets under management grew 8% to $307.7 billion at March 31, 2003, compared with $284.9 billion at March 31, 2002, and up 3% from $299.2 billion at December 31, 2002. "We are pleased with our results this quarter, especially considering the difficult environment in which we are operating. At MetLife, we are beginning to see the positive effects of what has now become a very real flight to quality. This trend, coupled with the power of the MetLife brand and the strength of our people, is enhancing the top-line growth across our businesses," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. "Although the equity market performance in the first quarter was disappointing, we are encouraged by the performance thus far in the second quarter," added Mr. Benmosche. "And, the credit environment, although still challenging, has improved significantly from 2002. Our results reflect this improvement, as well as our continued prudent stance on impairments last year, with a 46% reduction in gross investment losses and a 21% reduction in the balance of gross unrealized investment losses versus the fourth quarter of 2002." "The diversification of our businesses and investment portfolio positions us to deliver even stronger results as the economy improves," continued Mr. Benmosche.
A reconciliation from net income and net income per share to operating earnings and operating earnings per share follows: After-tax net investment losses of $84 million in the first quarter of 2003 includes $221 million of pre-tax gross investment gains, offset by $357 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $268 million of writedowns and $89 million of losses related to sales of available-for-sale securities) and $34 million of losses on derivatives. After-tax net investment losses of $76 million in the first quarter of 2002 includes $545 million of pre-tax gross investment gains, offset by $621 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $338 million of writedowns and $283 million of losses related to sales of available-for-sale securities) and $29 million of losses on derivatives. In 2003, MetLife changed its method of measuring and allocating capital to its operating segments from a risk based capital method to one based on economic capital. While this change impacts the earnings and returns on allocated equity of the company's business segments, it has no impact on MetLife's consolidated results. The company believes that economic capital is a more rigorous model for measuring the risks inherent in its diverse businesses. MetLife did not change its method retrospectively. The impact of this change is quantified in each of the segments below. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS For each of the segments, the company provides below a reconciliation from net income to operating earnings. Reconciliations from net income to operating earnings for the product lines within each segment are provided in the financial tables accompanying this release. The discussions for each segment are based on operating earnings. Institutional Business Lower investment spreads and a $14 million after-tax increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs were partially offset by improved underwriting results in several product lines and an $5 million after-tax increase in earnings on allocated capital. Institutional Business, which consists of Group Life, Retirement & Savings, and Non-Medical Health & Other product lines, also reports the following highlights (all comparisons are with the quarter ended March 31, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Strong top-line growth, with total premiums, fees and other revenues up 12% to $2.44 billion.
- - Group Life operating earnings up $10 million to $78 million, due primarily to improved underwriting results. - - Group Life premiums, fees and other revenues up 7% to $1.34 billion. - - Retirement & Savings operating earnings down $32 million to $82 million, primarily as a result of lower investment spreads and reduced underwriting results, compared with more favorable underwriting results in the year-ago period. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues from Retirement & Savings up 30% to $219 million. - - Retirement & Savings general account liabilities up 9% to $36.2 billion, and up 2% versus December 31, 2002. - - Non-Medical Health & Other operating earnings up $6 million to $59 million, due to improved underwriting results and higher earnings from allocated capital. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues for Non-Medical Health & Other up 15% to $880 million due to continuing growth in Group Long-Term Care, Group Disability and Group Dental. - Group Disability premiums, fees and other revenues increased 22% to $241 million. - Group Disability incurred loss ratio was 96.5%, down from 97.2%. Individual Business Individual Business continues to focus on achieving greater efficiencies of scale through expanded distribution, product innovations and expense reductions. After-tax expense savings of approximately $15 million, coupled with improved investment spreads, were more than offset by the continuing effects of lower equity markets on this segment's variable products, an $8 million after-tax increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, and a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings on allocated capital. Individual Business, which is comprised of Traditional Life, Variable & Universal Life, Annuities and Other product lines, also reports the following highlights (all comparisons are with the quarter ended March 31, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Total life insurance and annuity statutory premiums and deposits up 23% to $4.56 billion. - - Traditional Life operating earnings down $22 million to $76 million, due to strong underwriting results in the prior year period, higher pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, and lower earnings on allocated capital. - - Traditional Life insurance first year statutory premiums and deposits up 4% to $53 million. - - Variable & Universal Life operating earnings down $2 million to $23 million resulting from increased pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and lower earnings on allocated capital, partially offset by improved investment spreads and expense savings. - - Variable Life first year statutory premiums and deposits down 19% to $91 million. - - Universal Life first year statutory premiums and deposits up 57% to $55 million. - - Annuities operating earnings up $10 million to $50 million due to higher investment spreads and growth in the overall business partially offset by higher guaranteed minimum death benefit claims and lower earnings on allocated capital.
- - Annuity statutory deposits up 53% to $2.61 billion, driven by increases in production by MetLife Investors Group, up 106%; MetLife Financial Services, up 17%; New England Financial, up 28%; and MetLife Resources, up 6%. - - Fixed annuity statutory deposits up 58% to $424 million, and down 9% from the fourth quarter 2002. - - Variable annuity statutory deposits up 52% to $2.19 billion, and up 16% from the fourth quarter 2002. - - Operating earnings from the Other product line remained unchanged at $11 million. Auto & Home Auto and Home's earnings continued to benefit from rate increases, as well as expense efficiencies resulting from the completion of the St. Paul personal lines integration. This was partially offset by a $4 million after-tax reduction in earnings on allocated capital. Also, a return to more typical winter weather versus 2002's mild winter was expected, and did suppress earnings growth period over period. Additional highlights include: - - Favorable homeowners claims frequencies, which contributed to a reduction in the Property loss ratio to 50.2%, from 63.2% in the year ago period; - - A $7 million income tax benefit associated with this segment's tax-preferred municipal bond portfolio; - - Higher Auto claims frequencies in the Northeast from winter weather; and - - An Auto loss reserve strengthening related to older accident years of $30 million after-tax. International International's first quarter 2003 operating earnings benefited $20 million after-tax from the June 2002 acquisition in Mexico of Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A. This increase was partially offset by a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings on allocated capital. Reinsurance
Reinsurance operations are conducted primarily through Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), of which MetLife beneficially owns approximately 59%. Business growth and favorable mortality in RGA's U.S. operations were offset by a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings resulting from the aforementioned change in MetLife's capital allocation methodology. Asset Management A 14% decline in assets under management resulted in lower revenues. A reduction in operating expenses, including staff reductions during 2002, as well as a $2 million after-tax increase in earnings on allocated capital, offset the decline in revenues. Corporate and Other The current period benefited from higher investment income resulting primarily from joint venture earnings (up $18 million after-tax) and earnings related to allocated capital (up $15 million after-tax) partially offset by lower yields on invested assets. In addition, the year-ago period includes a $48 million after-tax settlement provision for General American Life Insurance Company's former Medicare business. CORPORATE EVENTS Stock Options Expensed First quarter 2003 net income and operating earnings reflect a $3 million after-tax expense from MetLife's adoption of the fair-value recognition method of accounting for employee stock options on a prospective basis. MetLife Capital Trust I On May 15, 2003, the purchase contracts associated with the MetLife Capital Trust I equity security units will be settled. The company expects the settlement rate to be 2.97 shares of MetLife common stock per purchase contract, which will result in the issuance of approximately 59.8 million common shares on that date. The company will receive approximately $1.0 billion in proceeds from this issuance, which is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis used in the calculation of net income and operating earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2003 totaled 722.4 million shares. Included in this amount was 22.1 million shares related to the above-mentioned stock issuance, which is determined using the treasury method. As a result of the settlement of the purchase contracts and the issuance of the common shares, the company expects weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis to total
approximately 730 million shares in the quarter ending June 30, 2003 and approximately 760 million shares for periods thereafter, assuming no share repurchases or issuances.

NOTE: THE QUARTERLY FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT ("QFS") INCLUDES A FINANCIAL MEASURE, OPERATING EARNINGS, THAT IS NOT BASED ON GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("GAAP").

METLIFE USES OPERATING EARNINGS IN ANALYZING ITS PERFORMANCE; IT BELIEVES THAT THIS MEASURE ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING AND COMPARABILITY OF ITS PERFORMANCE BY EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES WHICH CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, THEREBY HIGHLIGHTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY DRIVERS OF THE BUSINESS. A RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS TO NET INCOME, THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, IS INCLUDED THROUGHOUT THE QFS.
