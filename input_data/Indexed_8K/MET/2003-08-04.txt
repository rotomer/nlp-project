Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: John Nadel (212) 578-2085 METLIFE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS NEW YORK, August 4, 2003 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported second quarter 2003 net income of $611 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $387 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2002. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 includes after-tax net investment losses of $40 million. Second quarter 2002 net income includes after-tax net investment losses of $117 million. MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as net income, excluding after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2003 are $651 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared with $504 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Second quarter 2003 net income and operating earnings also include the following items: - - A $64 million after-tax ($0.09 per diluted share) benefit from a reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement. - - After-tax earnings of $62 million ($0.08 per diluted share) from the merger of International's Mexican operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology. Second quarter 2002 net income and operating earnings also include a $30 million after-tax ($0.04 per diluted share) benefit from a reduction of the company's previously established liability for settlement death benefits related to its sales practice class action settlement recorded in 1999. Total premiums and fees for the second quarter of 2003 were $5.69 billion, up 9% from the prior year period. Total assets under management grew 16% to $331.8 billion at June 30, 2003, compared with $286.9 billion at June 30, 2002, and were up 8% from $307.7 billion at March 31, 2003. "In a still uncertain economy, earnings improved this quarter, assets under management grew, investment losses declined and underwriting results were favorable," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. "As demonstrated by our results, the
diversification of MetLife's businesses and investment portfolio continues to be critical to our success." "Specifically in regard to investments," Mr. Benmosche said, "gross investment losses declined by 47% and gross unrealized investment losses were down 42%, both compared with the first quarter of 2003." "We will continue to focus on sales growth and retention of business in the U.S. and abroad, which will enable us to continue to deliver earnings growth and shareholder value." A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: After-tax net investment losses of $40 million in the second quarter of 2003 include $188 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $103 million of writedowns and $85 million of losses related to sales of invested assets) and $3 million of losses on derivatives, partially offset by $137 million of pre-tax gross investment gains. After-tax net investment losses of $117 million in the second quarter of 2002 include $583 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $269 million of writedowns and $314 million of losses related to sales of invested assets) and $121 million of losses on derivatives, partially offset by $438 million of pre-tax gross investment gains. SIX MONTH RESULTS Net income for the first six months of 2003 is $973 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared with $716 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2002. Net income for the first six months of 2003 includes after-tax net investment losses of $124 million. For the first six months in 2002, net income includes net investment losses of $193 million and a $5 million benefit resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill, both of which are net of income taxes. Operating earnings for the first six months of 2003 are $1.10 billion, or $1.53 per diluted share, compared with $904 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period. Net income and operating earnings for the first six months of 2003 and 2002 also benefited from the aforementioned items from the second quarter of 2003 and 2002. Additionally, net income and operating earnings for the first six months of 2002 were reduced by a $48 million after-tax ($0.07 per diluted share) charge related to the settlement provision for General American Life Insurance Company's former Medicare business.
A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: In 2003, MetLife changed its method of measuring and allocating capital to its operating segments from a risk-based capital method to one based on economic capital. While this change impacts the earnings and returns on allocated equity of the company's business segments, it has no impact on MetLife's consolidated results. The company believes that economic capital is a more refined model for measuring the risks inherent in its diverse businesses. MetLife changed its method prospectively. The impact of this change is quantified in each of the segment discussions below. SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS For each of the segments, the company provides below a reconciliation from net income to operating earnings. Reconciliations from net income to operating earnings for the product lines within each segment are provided in the financial tables accompanying this release. The discussions for each segment are based on operating earnings. Institutional Business Improved underwriting results were partially offset by lower investment spreads, a $14 million after-tax increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, and $10 million after-tax of costs primarily related to office consolidations. Additionally, results benefited from a $4 million after-tax increase in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Institutional Business, which consists of Group Life, Retirement & Savings, and Non-Medical Health & Other product lines, reports the following highlights (all comparisons are with the quarter ended June 30, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Group Life operating earnings up $5 million to $79 million, due primarily to improved underwriting results.
- - Retirement & Savings operating earnings down $15 million to $120 million, primarily as a result of lower investment spreads and higher expenses largely related to pension and other post-retirement benefits. Both periods benefited from favorable underwriting-related experience. - - Non-Medical Health & Other operating earnings up $20 million to $61 million, due to continued business growth, improved underwriting results and higher earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. - - Group insurance, which includes Group Life and Non-Medical Health & Other, premiums, fees and other revenues up 10% to $2.24 billion. - - Group Life premiums, fees and other revenues up 5% to $1.34 billion. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues from Retirement & Savings down 10% to $403 million, primarily due to a large single-premium group annuity sale in the second quarter of 2002. - - Retirement & Savings general account liabilities up 13% to $39.11 billion, and up 8% versus March 31, 2003, including the proceeds from the sale of $1.9 billion of global guaranteed interest contracts in 2003. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues for Non-Medical Health & Other up 17% to $895 million, due to continuing growth in Group Long-Term Care, Group Disability and Group Dental, as well as continuing growth in the small business market. - Group Disability premiums, fees and other revenues increased 12% to $238 million. - Group Disability incurred loss ratio was 95.1%, down from 99.5%. Individual Business Higher equity market performance, coupled with favorable mortality results and expense savings, was more than offset by $14 million of after-tax costs primarily related to office consolidations, an $8 million after-tax increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Additionally, slightly lower investment spreads contributed to the decline in earnings. Individual Business, which is comprised of Traditional Life, Variable & Universal Life, Annuities and Other product lines, reports the following highlights (all comparisons are with the quarter ended June 30, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Traditional Life operating earnings down $20 million to $77 million due to higher pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and lower earnings on allocated capital, partially offset by favorable mortality results. Additionally, the prior year period benefited from relatively high income from private equity investments. - - Variable & Universal Life operating earnings down $1 million to $35 million, resulting from increased pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, the unlocking of deferred policy acquisition costs related to lapse experience on a block of variable life insurance business and lower earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Partially offsetting
these items were improved investment spreads, favorable mortality results and the impact of higher equity market performance. - - Annuities operating earnings up $6 million to $56 million due to higher equity market performance, favorable mortality results and growth in the overall business, partially offset by lower investment spreads and reduced earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. - - Total life insurance and annuity statutory premiums and deposits up 24% to $4.86 billion. - - Traditional Life first year statutory premiums and deposits down 14% to $49 million. - - Variable Life first year statutory premiums and deposits down 49% to $59 million. - - Universal Life first year statutory premiums and deposits up 45% to $71 million. - - Annuity statutory deposits up 59% to $2.93 billion, driven by sales growth at MetLife Investors Group, up 138%; MetLife Financial Services, up 17%; and New England Financial, up 16%. - Fixed annuity statutory deposits up 20% to $340 million, and down 20% from first quarter 2003. - Variable annuity statutory deposits up 66% to $2.59 billion, and up 19% from first quarter 2003. Auto & Home Growth in this segment resulted from continuing rate increases in its automobile and homeowners product lines, as well as lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher claims severity levels, increased catastrophe losses and a $4 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. The results also include: - - A $5 million after-tax reinsurance recoverable for weather-related losses. - - A $5 million after-tax partial reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency related to fires in Los Alamos, New Mexico during 2000.
International During the quarter, as part of its acquisition and integration strategy, International completed the legal merger of Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A into its original Mexican subsidiary, Seguros Genesis, S.A., forming MetLife Mexico, S.A. As a result of the merger of these companies, deferred tax valuation allowances were reduced by $40 million. Additionally, a change in reserve methodology resulted in a $22 million after-tax reduction in policyholder liabilities. Improved earnings from MetLife's other established international locations were partially offset by losses from start-up and developing operations, as well as by a $5 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Reinsurance Reinsurance operations are conducted primarily through Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), of which MetLife beneficially owns approximately 59%. Business growth and favorable mortality in RGA's U.S. operations were offset by a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Asset Management A 6% decline in assets under management (from $48.9 billion at June 30, 2002 to $46.1 billion at June 30, 2003), due in part to the impact of business exits in late 2002, resulted in an 18% decline in revenues period over period. Fully offsetting this was a corresponding reduction in operating expenses and a $2 million after-tax increase in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation.
Corporate and Other The current period benefited from a $64 million after-tax reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement, as well as earnings related to the aforementioned change in capital allocation (up $15 million after-tax). The 2002 results benefited from the aforementioned $30 million reduction of a previously established liability for settlement death benefits. CORPORATE EVENTS Stock Options Expensed Second quarter 2003 net income and operating earnings reflect a $3 million after-tax expense from MetLife's adoption of the fair-value recognition method of accounting for employee stock options on a prospective basis. MetLife Capital Trust I On May 15, 2003, the purchase contracts associated with the MetLife Capital Trust I equity security units were settled. In exchange for $1.01 billion, the company issued 2.97 shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock per purchase contract or approximately 59.8 million shares of treasury stock. Approximately $656 million, which represents the excess of the company's cost of the treasury stock ($1.66 billion) over the contract price of the stock issued to the purchase contract holders ($1.01 billion), was recorded as a direct reduction to retained earnings.

NOTE: The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted shares, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share in analyzing its performance; it believes that these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating earnings per diluted share to GAAP net income per diluted share the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in this QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, which is available at www.metlife.com.
