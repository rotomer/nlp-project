Contacts: For Media: Holly Sheffer (212) 578-4072 For Investors: John Nadel (212) 578-2085 METLIFE ANNOUNCES CHARGE AT ITS AFFILIATE NEW ENGLAND FINANCIAL NEW YORK, August 11, 2003 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today announced that it is adjusting its previously reported second quarter earnings by $31 million after-tax. This adjustment results from certain improperly deferred expenses at its affiliate, New England Financial, which is part of MetLife's Individual Business segment. The revised, as well as previously reported, second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 net income and operating earnings are shown below: "We are disappointed by the need for this adjustment and by the timing of it, one week after the release of our second quarter results," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. "Excluding this charge, we continue to work towards and expect to achieve our 2003 business plan," he added. Eileen McDonnell, currently senior vice president, Individual Insurance Business Development for MetLife, has been named president of New England Financial, replacing Thom Faria, who has left the company. Ms. McDonnell has had overall responsibility for field recruiting and training, advanced markets, strategic planning, expense management and field compensation for the MetLife, GenAmerica Financial and New England Financial distribution channels. Prior to joining MetLife earlier this year, Ms. McDonnell was senior vice president and head of individual insurance at Guardian Life Insurance Company. In that capacity, she was responsible
for retail distribution, product development, marketing and operations. Earlier in her career, Ms. McDonnell spent nearly ten years at AXA Financial. "We recruited Eileen several months ago because she brings a strong track record in leading and developing a highly productive agency sales force," said C. Robert Henrikson, president U.S. Insurance and Financial Services businesses. "Our appointment of Eileen to this important leadership position again underscores our commitment to grow New England Financial and its general agency sales force." The aforementioned $31 million after-tax charge resulted in a reduction to net income and operating earnings in the Traditional Life and Variable & Universal Life product lines within the Individual Business segment. For further details, a revised June 30, 2003 quarterly financial supplement is available on MetLife's Web site at www.metlife.com on the investor relations pages. MetLife, Inc., through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to individual and institutional customers. The MetLife companies serve approximately 12 million individuals in the U.S. and provide benefits to 37 million employees and family members through their plan sponsors.

NOTE: The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted shares, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share in analyzing its performance; it believes that these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating earnings per diluted share to GAAP net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in this QFS, in MetLife's earnings press release for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and in MetLife's press release dated August 11, 2003, all of which are available at www.metlife.com.
(METLIFE LOGO) =============================================================================== CORPORATE OVERVIEW Unaudited (Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data) (1) Presentation of net income throughout the QFS differs from other public filings with respect to discontinued operations. Presentation of discontinued operations in other public filings is in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. (2) Adjustments to net investment gains and losses include amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, charges and credits to participating contracts, and adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. (3) Operating earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2003 includes a $64 million after-tax benefit ($0.09 per diluted share) from a reduction of a previously established liability related to the Company's race conscious underwriting settlement and $62 million of after-tax earnings ($0.08 per diluted share) from the merger of the Company's Mexican operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology, and a $31 million after-tax charge ($0.05 per diluted share) related to previously deferred expenses. (4) Operating earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2002 includes a $169 million after-tax ($0.23 per diluted share) charge to cover costs associated with personal injury liabilities caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products, a $20 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) reduction of a previously established liability related to the Company's business realignment initiatives, and a $17 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) reduction of a previously established disability insurance liability related to the September 11, 2001 tragedies.

Rather, such gains or losses are recorded in capital in excess of par value on the balance sheet. However, such gains or losses are included in the calculation of net income per share. During the first quarter of 2003, net income per share includes a $21 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) charge associated with the Company's redemption of MetLife Capital Trust's mandatorily redeemable capital securities.
