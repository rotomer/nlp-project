(NYSE: MET) announced today in its filed 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2003 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has commenced a formal investigation of New England Securities Corporation, an indirect subsidiary of New England Life Insurance Company ("NES"), in response to NES informing the SEC that certain systems and controls relating to one NES advisory program were not operating effectively. NES is cooperating fully with the SEC and is continuing to research the effect, if any, of this issue upon approximately 6,000 active and closed accounts. In commenting about this investigation, the company clarified that the NES administrative system for this advisory program did not correctly rebalance asset allocations within certain investment manager accounts. The company intends to make affected clients whole and currently estimates a pre-tax cost of between $3 million and $11 million to do so. The company also added that it believes it is appropriately reserved for this matter. MetLife, Inc., through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to individual and institutional customers. The MetLife companies serve approximately 12 million individuals in the U.S. and provide benefits to 37 million employees and family members through their plan sponsors. Outside the U.S., the MetLife companies have insurance operations in 12 countries serving approximately 8 million customers. # # # This release contains statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries, as well as other statements including words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and other similar expressions.
