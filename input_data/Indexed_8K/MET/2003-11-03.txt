Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Kevin Helmintoller (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2003 RESULTS NEW YORK, November 3, 2003 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported third quarter 2003 net income of $574 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared with $328 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the third quarter of 2003 includes certain after-tax net investment losses of $42 million. Third quarter 2002 net income includes certain after-tax net investment losses of $169 million. MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as net income, excluding certain after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2003 are $616 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared with $502 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the prior year period. The weighted average diluted common shares outstanding increased 5.3% to 760.9 million at September 30, 2003, compared with 722.7 million at September 30, 2002. The increase was due to the settlement on May 15, 2003 of the purchase contracts associated with the equity security units issued by the company and MetLife Capital Trust I. Third quarter 2003 net income and operating earnings also include a $28 million after-tax benefit from a reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement, as well as a $36 million benefit from a revision of the estimate of income taxes for 2002. (These items combined are $0.08 per diluted share.) Third quarter 2002 net income includes a $5 million after-tax charge ($0.01 per diluted share) resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill. Total premiums and fees for the third quarter of 2003 were $5.70 billion, up 8% from the prior year period. Total assets under management grew 16% to $336.6 billion at September 30, 2003, compared with $290.2 billion at September 30, 2002, and were up 1% from $331.7 billion at June 30, 2003.
"During the quarter, we continued to meet or exceed our goals on an overall basis, with operating earnings per share up 17% over the prior year period," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer. "We experienced overall business growth, while benefiting from improved equity and credit markets. Annuity deposits, total premiums and fees were all up, and underwriting was favorable across Institutional and Individual businesses." "Our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers and our diligence in developing innovative products and services, and containing costs, has served us well in this increasingly competitive marketplace, as demonstrated by solid premium and fee growth, and a continued increase in assets under management," added Mr. Benmosche. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: 1. After-tax net investment losses exclude $23 million and $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. After-tax net investment losses of $42 million in the third quarter of 2003 include $195 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $89 million of writedowns and $106 million of losses related to sales of invested assets) and $109 million of pre-tax losses on derivative instruments, partially offset by $153 million of pre-tax gross investment gains. For the third quarter of 2002, after-tax net investment losses totaled $169 million, and consisted of $719 million of pre-tax gross investment losses (including $555 million of writedowns and $164 million of losses related to sales of invested assets), partially offset by $412 million of pre-tax gross investment gains and $21 million of pre-tax gains on derivative instruments. New England Financial Update - ---------------------------- Prior to filing its second quarter earnings on Form 10-Q, MetLife announced a $31 million after-tax charge related to an affiliate, New England Financial. MetLife notified the SEC about the nature of this charge prior to its announcement. The SEC is pursuing a formal investigation of the matter and MetLife is fully cooperating with the investigation. NINE MONTH RESULTS Net income for the first nine months of 2003 is $1.52 billion, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared with $1.04 billion, or $1.42 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2002. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 includes certain after-tax net investment losses of $166 million. For the first nine months in 2002, net income includes certain after-tax net investment losses of $362 million. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2003 are $1.68 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $1.92 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Net income and operating earnings for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 include the aforementioned items from the third quarters of 2003 and 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, net income and operating earnings also include a $64 million after-tax benefit ($0.09 per diluted share) from a second quarter 2003 reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement. Additionally, results for the first nine months of 2003 include after-tax earnings of $62 million ($0.08 per diluted share) in the International segment from the merger of the company's Mexican
operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities there resulting from a change in reserve methodology. For the first nine months of 2002, net income and operating earnings were reduced by a $48 million after-tax charge ($0.07 per diluted share) related to the settlement provision for General American Life Insurance Company's former Medicare business. Additionally, these results include a $30 million after-tax benefit ($0.04 per diluted share) from a reduction of the company's previously established liability for settlement death benefits related to its sales practice class action settlement recorded in 1999. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: 1. After-tax net investment losses exclude $36 million and $14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS Change in Method of Measuring and Allocating Capital - ---------------------------------------------------- In 2003, MetLife changed its method of measuring and allocating capital to its operating segments from a risk-based capital method to one based on economic capital. While this change impacts the earnings and returns on allocated equity of the company's business segments, it has no impact on MetLife's consolidated results. The company believes that economic capital is a more refined model for measuring the risks inherent in its diverse businesses. MetLife changed its method prospectively as of January 1, 2003. The impact of this change is quantified in each of the segment discussions. For each of the segments, the company provides a reconciliation from net income to operating earnings. Reconciliations from net income to operating earnings for the product lines within each segment are provided in the financial tables accompanying this release. The discussions for each segment are based on operating earnings. Institutional Business - ---------------------- Improved underwriting results primarily in Non-Medical Health & Other and to a lesser extent Group Life, as well as higher investment spreads in Group Life, contributed to this segment's results. These items were partially offset by a $7 million after-tax increase in pension and other
post-retirement benefit costs. Additionally, results benefited from a $4 million after-tax increase in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Institutional Business, which consists of Group Life, Retirement & Savings, and Non-Medical Health & Other product lines, reports the following highlights (all comparisons are with the quarter ended September 30, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Group Life operating earnings up $10 million to $94 million, due primarily to higher investment spreads and improved underwriting results. - - Retirement & Savings operating earnings up $1 million to $104 million. - - Non-Medical Health & Other operating earnings up $19 million to $66 million, due primarily to improved underwriting results in dental and long-term care products, and higher earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. - - Group Life premiums, fees and other revenues up 3.4% to $1.35 billion. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues from Retirement & Savings up 32% to $337 million, primarily due to higher sales in structured settlement products. - - Retirement & Savings general account liabilities up 13% to $40.2 billion. - - Premiums, fees and other revenues for Non-Medical Health & Other up 12% to $883 million, due to continuing growth in dental, disability and long-term care, as well as continuing growth in the small business market. Individual Business - ------------------- The effect of higher equity market performance was more than offset by lower net investment income primarily from corporate joint ventures, a $9 million after-tax increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, somewhat less favorable mortality results and a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. During the 2002 quarter, Individual Business operating earnings benefited by approximately $50 million (after-tax) from several items, which significantly increased Traditional Life operating earnings and partially raised operating earnings for Variable & Universal Life. These items include higher investment income related to sales of underlying assets in corporate joint ventures, a refund of interest associated with a prior-year tax payment and a reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation within the closed block. Individual Business, which is comprised of Traditional Life, Variable & Universal Life, Annuities and Other product lines, reports the following highlights in addition to those described above (all comparisons are with the quarter ended September 30, 2002, unless otherwise noted): - - Traditional Life operating earnings down $61 million to $66 million due to lower net investment income primarily from corporate joint ventures, lower mortality gains compared to favorable mortality results in the prior year period, and lower income as a result of the aforementioned change in capital allocation. The 2002 quarter results benefit from the
aforementioned refund of interest associated with a prior-year tax payment and a reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation within the closed block. - - Variable & Universal Life operating earnings down $10 million to $30 million, resulting from lower earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation and somewhat lower mortality results. Partially offsetting these items are the impact of higher equity market performance and lower expenses. - - Annuities operating earnings up $23 million to $67 million due to growth in the overall business and higher equity market performance, partially offset by reduced earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. - - Total life insurance and annuity statutory premiums and deposits up 20% to $4.81 billion. - - Traditional Life first year statutory premiums and deposits up 9% to $50 million. - - Variable Life first year statutory premiums and deposits down 11% to $86 million. - - Universal Life first year statutory premiums and deposits up 30% to $82 million. - - Annuity statutory deposits up 43% to $2.84 billion, driven by sales growth at MetLife Investors Group, up 71%; MetLife Financial Services, up 14%; and New England Financial, up 31%. - Fixed annuity statutory deposits down 29% to $320 million, and down 6% from second quarter 2003. - Variable annuity statutory deposits up 64% to $2.52 billion, and down 3% from second quarter 2003. Auto & Home - ----------- An increase in catastrophe losses from $6 million pre-tax to $25 million pre-tax (due in part to Hurricane Isabel), and a $4 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation, contributed to the decrease in earnings. This segment, however, benefited from continuing rate increases in its automobile and homeowners product lines, lower operating expenses and the impact from its ongoing risk management program. International - ------------- Strong earnings from MetLife's established international locations were offset by the funding of growth initiatives and expected losses from start-up and developing operations. Third quarter results were also reduced by a $5 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation.
Reinsurance - ----------- Reinsurance operations are conducted primarily through Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), of which MetLife beneficially owns approximately 59%. Business growth in all of RGA's operating segments was offset by less favorable mortality in its U.S. operating segment and a $6 million after-tax reduction in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Asset Management - ---------------- Favorable equity market performance contributed to this segment's results, as well as lower expenses due to more streamlined products and a $2 million after-tax increase in earnings due to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. Corporate and Other - ------------------- The 2003 period benefited from a $28 million after-tax reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement, as well as a $36 million benefit from a revision of the estimate of income taxes for 2002. Third quarter 2003 results also include a $15 million after-tax increase in earnings related to the aforementioned change in capital allocation. CORPORATE EVENTS Stock Options Expensed - ---------------------- Third quarter 2003 net income and operating earnings reflect a $3 million after-tax expense from MetLife's adoption (as of January 1, 2003) of the fair-value recognition method of accounting for employee stock options on a prospective basis.

NOTE: - ---- The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding certain after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. Metlife uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share in analyzing its performance; it believes that these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating earnings per diluted share to GAAP net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in Metlife's earnings press release, dated November 3, 2003, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, which are available at www.metlife.com.
