METLIFE, INC. DEBT SECURITIES UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT November 19, 2003 To the Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the respective Pricing Agreements hereinafter described Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time, MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) the principal amount of its securities or aggregate number of shares identified in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (the "Securities" with respect to such Pricing Agreement). The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Senior Indenture or Subordinated Indenture, in each case as supplemented by one or more Supplemental Indentures (each such Senior Indenture or Subordinated Indenture, as so supplemented, an "Indenture") or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (including the applicable Certificate of Designation), as applicable (each a "Securities Agreement"), and identified in such Pricing Agreement. Particular sales of Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Securities or the total number of shares, as the case may be, the initial public offering price of such Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount or number of shares, as the case may be, of such Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter. In addition, such Pricing Agreement shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Securities and payment therefor. Such Pricing Agreement shall also specify (in a manner not inconsistent with the applicable Securities Agreements and the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 1. Representations and Warranties.

actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the applicable Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other 15
shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus relating to the applicable Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the applicable Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Defaulting Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of any defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased does not exceed ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as applicable, to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, 16
to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased exceeds ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 9. Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 10. Effect of Termination of Pricing Agreement or Nondelivery of Securities. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of such Securities except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof. 11. Reliance upon Representatives. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of the Underwriters of Securities and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the applicable Pricing Agreements. 12. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication; notices to the Representatives shall be directed to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the applicable Pricing Agreements with a copy to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, New York 10036, attention of Susan J. Sutherland, Esq.; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. 13. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, and, to the extent provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 17
14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 15. Consent to Jurisdiction. The Company agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any State or federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding. 16. Offering Restrictions. Each of the Underwriters represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any of the Securities, or distribute the Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations thereof and that will not impose any obligations on the Company, except as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement. In particular, each Underwriter severally represents and agrees as set forth in Annex IV to this Agreement. 17. Counterparts. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18

ANNEX II SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (NY) GENAMERICA FINANCIAL CORPORATION (MO) GENERAL AMERICAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (MO) REINSURANCE GROUP OF AMERICA, INCORPORATED (MO) NEW ENGLAND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (MA) METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY (RI) STATE STREET RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT COMPANY (DE)
ANNEX III November XX, 2003 [Address to underwriters] Dear Sirs: We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, and the related financial statement schedules, all included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 ("Form 10-K"), and incorporated by reference in registration statement (No. 333-61282) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"); our report with respect thereto is also incorporated by reference in that registration statement. The registration statement, as amended on May 30, 2001, is herein referred to as the registration statement. We have also reviewed (a) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2003, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 ("Third Quarter Form 10-Q") and incorporated by reference in the registration statement as indicated in our report dated November 7, 2003; (b) the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2002, included in the Company's Form 10-K, as indicated in our report dated November __, 2003 and; (c) the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 included in the Company's Third Quarter Form 10-Q, as indicated in our report dated November __, 2003; our reports with respect thereto are attached. In connection with the registration statement-- 1. We are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 2. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by us and incorporated by reference in the registration statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. 3. We have not audited any consolidated financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2002; although we have conducted an audit for the year ended December 31, 2002, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002, and for the year ended, but not on the consolidated financial statements for any interim period within that year. Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on: (a) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2003, the related unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003 included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, incorporated by reference in the registration statement; (b) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2003, the related unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated III-1
statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, incorporated by reference in the registration statement; (c) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, included in the Company's Third Quarter Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the registration statement; or (d) on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows as of any other date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2002. 4. For purposes of this letter we have read the 2003 minutes of meetings of MetLife, Inc.'s stockholders, board of directors, executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, corporate social responsibility committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee as set forth in the minute books at November __, 2003, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein and have carried out other procedures to November __, 2003, (our work did not extend to November __, 2003) with respect to the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003, the related unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, incorporated by reference in the registration statement, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit of financial statements conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations regarding the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes. 5. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements described in item 4 do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. 6. Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 30, 2003, are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in consolidated financial statement items after September 30, 2003, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in item 4. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at November __, 2003, there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt or any decreases in consolidated assets or stockholders' equity of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown in the September 30, 2003, unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the registration statement or (b) for the period from October 1, 2003 to November __, 2003, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated revenues or in the total or per-share amounts of net income. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in item 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change, increase, or decrease, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur. III-2
7. For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached copy of Form 10-K, the Prospectus Supplement to the registration statement dated November __, 2003 and Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 22, 2003, and have performed the following procedures, which were applied as indicated with respect to the symbols explained below-- [SYMBOLS TO BE ADDED] 8. It should be noted that we make no representation regarding questions of legal interpretation or regarding the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in the preceding paragraph; also, such procedures would not necessarily reveal any material misstatements of the amounts or percentages listed above. Further, we have addressed ourselves solely to the foregoing data as set forth in the registration statement and make no representations regarding the adequacy of disclosures or regarding whether any material facts have been omitted. 9. This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the registration statement, and it is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to within or without the underwriting group for any purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the registration statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the registration statement. Yours truly, III-3

In connection with the foregoing, I or other attorneys of the Company over whom I exercise general supervisory authority have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise authenticated to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company, and such agreements, letters or certificates as to matters of fact of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and such other agreements, instruments, statements, documents, certificates and corporate or other records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein. In making such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where I have not independently established or verified facts material to the opinion hereinafter expressed, I have relied upon oral or written statements, certificates, opinions and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others. I believe that you and I are justified in relying upon such statements, certificates, opinions and representations. Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Senior Notes have been validly issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture. The opinion set forth above is subject to the effects of (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws now or hereafter in
effect affecting creditors' rights generally, (2) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity), (3) an implied covenant of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and standards of materiality and (4) limitations with respect to enforceability of provisions of the Indenture providing for indemnification or contribution, arising under applicable law (including court decisions) or public policy. I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York, and do not hold myself out as being conversant with the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K filed on November 24, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the use of my name under the caption "Legal Opinions" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby concede that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
