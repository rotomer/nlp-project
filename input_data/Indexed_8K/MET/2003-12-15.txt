Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition to her current leadership role at the Gates Foundation, Sylvia has been an integral and significant player in the development of a variety of financial, legislative and civic issues of national importance. Her in-depth knowledge and extensive background, which includes experiences in both the public and private sectors, will make her an extremely valuable addition to the MetLife board." As COO and executive director for Libraries & Pacific Northwest giving, Mathews has been responsible for the Gates Foundation's annual budget, payout management, grant making to libraries, PNW community and global health advocacy organizations. Recently, Mathew's responsibilities have grown to incorporate an expanded focus on advocacy, including policy and finance, across all Foundation program areas - education, global health, libraries and PNW. With increased oversight for advocacy, Mathews will transfer oversight of finance, administration and human resources to the Foundation's CFO and will retain oversight responsibility for the foundation's legal affairs. She also serves on the Gates Foundation's executive team, helping to shape and implement overall strategy. In addition, she plans and coordinates the building of partnerships with governments, industry, United Nations agencies, other foundations and non-governmental organizations. Before joining the Gates Foundation in 2001, Mathews was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, D.C. In this role, she worked with the director to develop the strategy and negotiate for the more than $1.5 trillion annual budget for the president of the United States. From 1997 to 1998, she served as deputy chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. From 1995 to 1997, she was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and also served as staff director for the National Economic Council from 1993 to 1995. Mathews was manager of President Clinton's economic transition team from 1992 to 1993. Prior to that, she was an associate at McKinsey and Company from 1990 to 1992. Mathews received an A.B. degree in government, cum laude, from Harvard University in 1987 and a bachelor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Oxford University, where she was a Rhodes Scholar.
She is a member of the University of Washington Medicine board, the Pacific Council on International Policy, the Aspen Strategy Group and the CFR Task Force on Transatlantic Relations for the Council on Foreign Relations.
