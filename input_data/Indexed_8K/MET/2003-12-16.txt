Robert H. Benmosche Chairman and Chief Executive Officer MetLife, Inc.
Robert H. Benmosche is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. He was named to this position at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company on July 1, 1998 and to his position at MetLife, Inc. on April 5, 2000.
Benmosche's strategic vision to position MetLife as a strong competitor in the new financial services marketplace was the impetus behind the insurer's demutualization and the formation of MetLife, Inc., a public company. MetLife, Inc. is the most widely held stock in North America.
In preparation for becoming a public company, Benmosche was responsible for making changes in corporate culture. He consolidated client service and compliance functions to improve quality standards and achieve greater economies of scale. He also streamlined the decision making process by moving authority closer to the business lines. A new performance management process was implemented that ties employee incentives to results and helps MetLife associates develop skills needed to build and maintain caring customer relationships.
Under Benmosche's leadership, MetLife has made acquisitions to grow core competencies. These include the 2003 acquisition of John Hancock's group life insurance business; the 2000 acquisition of GenAmerica Corporation and its subsidiaries; as well as the 1999 purchases of the disability income insurance business of Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the standard personal lines property and casualty insurance operations of the St. Paul Companies.
Benmosche joined MetLife on September 1, 1995 as an executive vice president to direct the merger with New England Financial. In February 1996 he was named executive vice president in charge of Individual Business. In that position, he was responsible for all product development, marketing and sales efforts focused on MetLife's individual customers. This included all life products, annuities and mutual funds, and the career agency sales force. On November 1, 1997, he was named president and chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors.
As president and chief operating officer, Benmosche was responsible for the company's primary lines of business, Individual and Institutional, as well as its International operations. In addition, he oversaw two other units: the business services group, which includes technology and call center operations, and corporate development and services, which includes corporate human resources and facilities and services.
 
Before joining MetLife, Benmosche was an executive vice president at PaineWebber and a member of the company's incorporated board of directors. In this position, he was in charge of the firm's southern division, comprised of 80 branch offices with over 1,500 retail brokers. He also directed the merger of Kidder Peabody into PaineWebber.
Benmosche joined PaineWebber in 1982 from Chase Manhattan Bank. As a senior vice president in marketing in 1984, he was responsible for marketing IRAs, insurance, financial planning, retirement plans and money market funds through the firm's retail brokerage sales force. In 1986, he was named chief financial officer of PaineWebber's retail business. The next year, as director of securities operations, he successfully moved the brokerage operation from New York to New Jersey and completed a major reengineering effort.
Two years later he was given added responsibilities for PaineWebber's technology organization and the facilities and administration organizations. PaineWebber became one of the first firms to implement a state-of-the-art client/server technology platform. In 1992 Benmosche's responsibilities were further expanded to include human resources.
Benmosche holds a B.A. degree in mathematics from Alfred University. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps between 1966 and 1968.
He served on the boards of the National Securities Clearing Corporation between 1990 and 1994 and the Chicago Stock Exchange from 1994 through 1995. He is currently on the board of trustees of Alfred University and on the board of directors of Credit Suisse Group and the New York Philharmonic.
