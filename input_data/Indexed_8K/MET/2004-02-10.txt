Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Kevin Helmintoller (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2003 RESULTS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME UP 25% TO $701 MILLION FROM THE 2002 PERIOD FULL-YEAR NET INCOME UP 38% TO $2.22 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR FULL-YEAR STATUTORY ANNUITY DEPOSITS UP 42% TO $11.2 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR NEW YORK, February 10, 2004 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported fourth quarter 2003 net income of $701 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with $561 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2002. FOURTH QUARTER 2003 HIGHLIGHTS o Total premiums and fees rose 10% to $6.4 billion from the 2002 period o Statutory annuity deposits up 21% to $2.8 billion from the 2002 period o Company repurchased three million common shares Strong top-line growth, robust earnings performance and high investment income during the fourth quarter of 2003 were partially offset by expenses related to certain efficiency initiatives, as well as an increase in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. These additional expenses stem from a number of consolidation activities including office closings, lease terminations, fixed asset write-offs, as well as staff reductions. Including the impact of these expenses, the company achieved its fourth quarter and full-year objectives. Further, these initiatives will assist the company's ability to meet or exceed its growth objectives in 2004 while enhancing overall efficiency. Commenting on the fourth quarter results, chairman and chief executive officer Robert H. Benmosche said, "We're pleased with our performance and continue to actively manage all aspects of our business for the long-term. While the credit markets have continued to improve, we're rapidly growing assets under management, as well as premiums and fees. We are also appropriately managing our crediting rates to support our spreads while providing customers a competitive return. The combination of these strategies is producing earnings in line with our stated objectives, and at the same time giving us further confidence in our ability to achieve long-term objectives." Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 includes after-tax net investment gains of $162 million, and an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $26 million resulting from the required application of a new accounting standard. Fourth quarter 2002 net income included after-tax net investment gains of $223 million, a $169 million after-tax charge related to the company's asbestos-related litigation, a $20 million after-tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for the company's 2001 business realignment initiatives, and a $17 million after-tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for disability insurance-related losses from the September 11, 2001 tragedies.
MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as net income, excluding certain after-tax net investment gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of certain investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the after-tax impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $565 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared with $338 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2002 included the previously mentioned items in the net income discussion above. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: (1.) After-tax net investment gains exclude $17 million and $7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. (2.) After-tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the three months ended December 31, 2003 is in accordance with FASB Statement 133 Implementation Issue B36 ("Issue B36"). FULL-YEAR RESULTS Net income for 2003 was $2.22 billion, or $2.94 per diluted share. For 2002, net income was $1.61 billion, or $2.20 per diluted share. For 2003, net income includes after-tax net investment losses of $4 million. Net income for 2002 included after-tax net investment losses of $139 million. FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS: o Increased statutory annuity deposits by 42% to $11.2 billion from the prior year o Increased total premiums and fees to $23.17 billion, up 9% from the prior year o Expanded assets under management by 17% to $350.2 billion from the prior year o Continued strong investment spreads o Grew book value, excluding other comprehensive income, nearly 19% to $18.4 billion from the prior year
Operating earnings for 2003 were $2.25 billion, or $3.01 per diluted share, compared with $1.74 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, in 2002. Full-year 2003 net income and operating earnings also include after-tax benefits totaling $92 million from a reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement, as well as an after-tax benefit of $62 million in the International segment from the merger of the company's Mexican operations and a reduction in Mexico of policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology. Full year net income and operating earnings also include a $36 million benefit from a revision of the estimate of income taxes for 2002 and a $31 million after-tax charge resulting from certain improperly deferred expenses at its affiliate, New England Financial, part of MetLife's Individual Business segment. Full-year 2002 net income and operating earnings also included the previously mentioned items in the fourth quarter 2002 net income discussion above, as well as a $48 million after-tax charge related to settlement provisions for General American Life Insurance Company's former Medicare business, and a $30 million after-tax benefit from a reduction of the company's previously established liability for death benefits related to its sales practices class action settlement, recorded in 1999. "In addition to further strengthening our financial position in 2003, we laid the groundwork for strong future performance. Specifically, we strengthened the management of our distribution systems and took aggressive action in consolidating office space and reducing redundancies while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure," said Benmosche. "Moving ahead in 2004, we will continue to deliver on our promises to customers and investors by providing competitive products and innovative solutions backed by a financially strong enterprise." A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: (1.) After-tax net investment losses exclude $53 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. (2.) After-tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the year ended December 31, 2003 is in accordance with Issue B36. FOURTH QUARTER INVESTMENTS AND SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment operating earnings to net income are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
INVESTMENTS The company completed several opportunistic sales of high profile real estate properties in the fourth quarter, including 11 Madison Avenue in New York City and 1 California Plaza in Los Angeles. The pre-tax gain on the sale of these two properties in the fourth quarter was $329 million, leaving the company with an estimated $3.6 billion of unrealized gains in the real estate portfolio. As expected, corporate joint venture income returned to more normal levels in the quarter while bond prepayment fees and commercial mortgage prepayments were at a higher than normal level. Finally, the company also reduced several equity positions, which resulted in gains, and reinvested the proceeds in income producing securities, which will help enhance operating earnings in the future. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS Institutional Business operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $277 million compared with $262 million in 2002. The fourth quarter 2002 included the impact of the aforementioned $20 million and $17 million reserve reductions, both net of taxes. The 2003 results reflect most of the impact of the higher investment income discussed in the investments section, as can be seen in higher than expected spreads in all product lines, and a $4 million after-tax favorable impact of the change in method of allocating capital. This was offset by costs associated with the aforementioned office closures and other consolidations, as well as higher pension and post-retirement benefit costs. Underwriting results continued to be strong in the Group Life product line while premium growth in the Dental, Long-Term Care and the Small Business Center product lines was 15% compared with the prior year quarter, and premiums in the Non Medical Health product line overall grew by 11%, compared with the prior year quarter. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS Individual Business operating earnings were $173 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with $174 million in 2002. Traditional Life results were in line with expectations while Variable Life/Universal Life results reflected higher mortality experience and the impact of recapturing previously reinsured business. Annuity results were strong at $85 million for the quarter reflecting substantial deposit growth, strong market performance and higher investment spreads. Individual Business results, across all product lines, were impacted more than the other business segments by the efficiency initiatives taken in the fourth quarter while benefiting somewhat less from the higher investment income. The 2003 fourth quarter results were also unfavorably impacted by $6 million after-tax as a result of the change in method of allocating capital. OTHER SEGMENTS The Auto & Home segment produced operating earnings in line with expectations at $53 million compared with $48 million in 2002. Results continue to benefit from rate increases across the book of business and disciplined underwriting and claims practices, as well as the broader volatility management program, and a $4 million after-tax unfavorable impact of the change in method of allocating capital. The International segment produced operating earnings of $34 million, compared with $38 million in the 2002 quarter. The 2003 results were unfavorably impacted by $5 million after-tax as a result of the change in method of allocating capital. The previously announced $19 million after-tax charge in Taiwan related to loss recognition due to low interest rates was offset by a $12 million tax benefit in Chile and an $8 million benefit related to reinsurance treaties.
CORPORATE EVENTS Share Repurchase - ---------------- For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the company repurchased through its share repurchase program approximately three million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $97 million.
