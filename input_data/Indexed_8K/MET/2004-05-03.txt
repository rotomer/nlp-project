Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Kevin Helmintoller (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2004 RESULTS Reports Net Income of $0.69 Per Share, a 47% Increase NEW YORK, May 3, 2004 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported first quarter 2004 net income of $523 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $362 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003. First Quarter 2004 Highlights o Achieved $362.9 billion in assets under management, an 18% increase over the prior year period and the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth o Reached record annuity deposits of $3.4 billion, an increase of 32% over the prior year period o Earned total premiums and fees of $6.0 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year period Top-line revenue growth across all of MetLife's business segments, favorable claims experience and an improvement in investment-related gains and losses all contributed to the 44% increase in net income in the first quarter of 2004, compared with the prior year period. Commenting on the first quarter results, chairman and chief executive officer Robert H. Benmosche said, "During the quarter, we continued to demonstrate our ability to grow premiums and fees, as well as annuity deposits through our leading market positions, innovative products, diversified distribution channels and improved sales force productivity. At the same time, we are operating in a dramatically improved credit and equity market environment compared to the prior year period." "We were also pleased with Moody's decision to affirm the ratings of MetLife, Inc., Metropolitan Life and other rated affiliates while raising the ratings outlook to stable. In today's marketplace, where clients are seeking dependable partners to help them build financial freedom, MetLife continues to exhibit its ability to meet this demand by offering unique solutions that are backed by financial strength and a trusted, well-recognized brand," added Benmosche. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 includes after-tax net investment-related gains of $85 million, and an approximate $158 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting resulting from the required application of a new accounting standard (AICPA Statement of Position 03-1). Net income for the first quarter of 2003 includes after-tax net investment-related losses of $84 million. - 1 -
MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding certain after-tax net investment-related gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of certain investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the after-tax impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Operating earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were $596 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared with $446 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the prior year period. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: (1) Net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include gains on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $13 million and $57 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. In addition, net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, exclude gains of $9 million and $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. (2) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2004 relates to the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-Traditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment operating earnings to net income are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 45% Institutional Business operating earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were $317 million, compared with $219 million in the prior year period. Asset growth and strong interest margins in Retirement and Savings, as well as favorable underwriting results contributed to the increase. - 2 -
During the quarter, Group Life premiums, fees and other revenues grew 10% over the prior year period. In addition, Retirement and Savings premiums, fees and other revenues increased 47% primarily as the result of the sale of a significant single premium contract during the first quarter, as well as higher structured settlement premiums. Non-medical health insurance premiums, fees and other revenues increased 10% during the quarter due to continued growth in the Dental business, particularly from the Small Business Center distribution channel, and the Long-Term Care business. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 15% Individual Business operating earnings were $184 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with $160 million in the prior year period. Results in Individual Business were driven by robust earnings growth in the annuity product line due to strong deposit growth and higher equity market levels. These factors led to an 84% increase in fees for the investment-type products within the Annuity business, compared with the year ago period. Partially offsetting these results was the impact of the lower interest rate environment on the interest spreads earned, higher expenses related in part to ongoing office consolidations and related fixed asset write-offs, as well as the continuing decline in revenues from the company's closed block business. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 53% Auto & Home operating earnings were $46 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with $30 million in the prior year period. Results continue to benefit from rate increases and disciplined underwriting practices, as well as the broader volatility management program. INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS UP 57% International segment operating earnings were $44 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with $28 million in the prior year period. Total operating revenues increased 8% to $622 million in the 2004 quarter, compared with the 2003 quarter. The sale of MetLife Iberia, S.A. in the first quarter of 2004 reduced revenues by 9%, compared with the 2003 quarter, but did not have a material impact on operating earnings. Excluding this sale, revenues increased by $96 million, or 18%, over the prior year quarter and were primarily driven by sales growth in almost all countries in which MetLife operates. CORPORATE EVENTS SHARE REPURCHASE For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the company repurchased through its share repurchase program approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $65 million. At March 31, 2004, the company had approximately $644 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization.
