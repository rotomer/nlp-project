(NYSE: MET) announced today that its subsidiary, General American Life Insurance Company, has received a so-called "Wells Notice" in connection with a previously announced SEC investigation regarding market timing and late trading in a limited number of its privately-placed variable insurance contracts. The "Wells Notice" provides notice that the SEC staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil action alleging violations of U.S. securities laws. Under the SEC procedures, the recipient can avail itself of the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff before it makes a formal recommendation regarding whether any action alleging violations of the U.S. securities laws should be considered. MetLife continues to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation and is unaware of any systemic problems with respect to such matters that may have a material adverse effect upon MetLife's consolidated financial position. MetLife, Inc., through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to individual and institutional customers. The MetLife companies serve individuals in approximately 13 million households in the U.S. and provide benefits to 37 million employees and family members through their plan sponsors.
