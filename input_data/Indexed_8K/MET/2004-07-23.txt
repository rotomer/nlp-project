The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Senior Indenture or Subordinated Indenture, in each case as supplemented by one or more Supplemental Indentures (each such Senior Indenture or Subordinated Indenture, as so supplemented, an "Indenture") or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (including the applicable Certificate of Designation), as applicable (each a "Securities Agreement"), and identified in such Pricing Agreement. Particular sales of Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Securities or the total number of shares, as the case may be, the initial public offering price of such Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount or number of shares, as the case may be, of such Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter. In addition, such Pricing Agreement shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Securities and payment therefor. Such Pricing Agreement shall also specify (in a manner not inconsistent with the applicable Securities Agreements and the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

competent jurisdiction has found by final and nonappealable order that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (it being understood that if at the time of any such claim such Underwriter shall certify that it has sent or given the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented to any person making such claim at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, it shall be presumed that such Final Prospectus has been so sent or given unless the Company shall have sustained the burden of proving, in a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable order, that the facts are otherwise), if (i) such delivery to such person is required by Section 5 of the Act, (ii) the Company has furnished copies of such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented to such Underwriter a reasonable period of time prior to such Underwriter being required so to deliver such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented and (iii) the untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected by such Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying 15
party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the applicable Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus relating to the applicable Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the applicable Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Defaulting Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the 16
respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of any defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased does not exceed ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as applicable, to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of Securities, as applicable, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, which remains unpurchased exceeds ten percent of the aggregate number of shares of such Securities or the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, as applicable, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 9. Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 10. Effect of Termination of Pricing Agreement or Nondelivery of Securities. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of such Securities except as provided in Section 5 and Section 7 hereof. 11. Reliance upon Representatives. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of the Underwriters of Securities and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the applicable Pricing Agreements. 17
12. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication; notices to the Representatives shall be directed to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the applicable Pricing Agreements with a copy to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, New York 10036, attention of Susan J. Sutherland, Esq.; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to MetLife, Inc., 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, Attention: Treasurer. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. 13. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company, and, to the extent provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 15. Consent to Jurisdiction. The Company agrees that any legal suit, action or proceeding against the Company brought by any Underwriter or by any person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be instituted in any State or federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding. 16. Offering Restrictions. Each of the Underwriters severally represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any of the Securities, or distribute the Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations thereof and that will not impose any obligations on the Company, except as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement. In particular, each Underwriter severally represents and agrees as set forth in Annex IV to this Agreement. 18

The reading of minutes described in paragraph 4 of that letter has been carried out through July 21, 2004 (our work did not extend to July 23, 2004). C. The procedures and inquiries covered in paragraph 7 of that letter are revised with the following procedures and inquiries. With respect to the period from April 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004, we have-- i. Read the unaudited draft consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 furnished to us by the Company, officials of the Company
having advised us that no such financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to June 30, 2004, were available. ii. Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited draft consolidated financial statements referred to in C(i) are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the registration statement. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that -- iii. (a) At June 30, 2004, there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated assets or stockholders' equity of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown in the March 31, 2004 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's 2004 First Quarter Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the registration statement, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur and except as described below, or (b) for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, there were any decreases, as compared to the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2003, in consolidated revenues or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur. iv. As mentioned in paragraph C(i), Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to June 30, 2004 are available; accordingly no procedures have been carried out by us with respect to changes in consolidated financial statement items after June 30, 2004.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date. Notwithstanding Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes to be redeemed by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may select for redemption Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Security Registrar of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.

Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture. This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided herein and in the Indenture. If (i) at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and the Company does not appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, or (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Note shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form and executes and delivers to the Security Registrar a written order of the Company providing that this Note shall be so exchangeable, this Note shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form, provided that the definitive Senior Notes so issued in exchange for this Note shall be in denominations of $2,000 and any whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000, without coupons, and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this Note to be exchanged.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (b) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note. The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 15 basis points; plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date. "Treasury Rate" means the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means any of Banc of America Securities LLC and any successor firm or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an A-6
independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC and four other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Banc of America Securities LLC or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date. Notwithstanding Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes to be redeemed by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may select for redemption Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Security Registrar of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company. No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
