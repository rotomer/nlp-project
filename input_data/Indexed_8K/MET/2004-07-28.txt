EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Exhibit - ------- ------- 99.1 Press Release, dated July 28, 2004, announcing second quarter 2004 results. 99.2 Quarterly Financial Supplement for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS REPORTS NET INCOME OF $1.11 PER SHARE, A 41% INCREASE RAISES EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE FOR 2004 NEW YORK, July 28, 2004 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported second quarter 2004 net income of $842 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with $580 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003. SECOND QUARTER 2004 HIGHLIGHTS - - Achieved record quarterly net income of $842 million - - Earned total premiums and fees of $6.1 billion, a 7% increase over the prior year period - - Continued strong investment spreads - - Achieved record Auto & Home quarterly net income of $68 million Top-line revenue growth across all of MetLife's business segments, strong interest spreads, favorable claims experience and an improvement in investment-related gains and losses all contributed to the 45% increase in net income in the second quarter of 2004, compared with the prior year period. "MetLife had an outstanding quarter as we continued to generate strong top-line growth among our core businesses," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and CEO of MetLife, Inc. "Our competitive products, diversified distribution and well-recognized brand continue to serve us well in both the retail and group marketplaces. In addition to increases in premiums and fees, we also benefited from strong investment spreads." "We are increasingly confident in our ability to exceed our previously announced 2004 earnings target of $3.08 to $3.18 operating earnings per share. We now expect 2004 operating earnings per share to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.30," added Benmosche. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 includes after-tax net investment-related gains of $174 million. Second quarter 2003 net income includes after-tax net investment-related losses of $40 million; a $64 million after-tax ($0.09 per diluted share) benefit from a reduction of a previously established liability related to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's race conscious underwriting settlement; after-tax benefit of $62 million ($0.08 per diluted share) from the merger of the company's Mexican operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology; and a $31 million after-tax ($0.05 per diluted share) charge related to previously deferred expenses. 1
MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding certain after-tax net investment-related gains and losses, and the after-tax impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of certain investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the after-tax impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. In this release, MetLife provides guidance on its future earnings per share on an operating, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2004 were $668 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with $620 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the prior year period. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: (1) Net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include gains on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $85 million and $0 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. In addition, net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, exclude gains of $14 million and $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. SIX MONTH HIGHLIGHTS - - Increased individual annuity deposits by 14% to $6.3 billion from the prior year period - - Increased total premiums and fees to $12.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year period - - Continued strong investment spreads - - Grew equity book value, excluding other comprehensive income, nearly 13% to $19.5 billion from the prior year period 2
SIX MONTH RESULTS Net income for the first six months of 2004 is $1.37 billion, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared with $942 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2003. Net income for the first six months of 2004 includes after-tax net investment gains of $259 million and an approximate $158 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting resulting from the required application of a new accounting standard (AICPA Statement of Position 03-1). Net income for the first six months of 2003 includes after-tax net investment losses of $124 million. Operating earnings for the first six months of 2004 are $1.26 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared with $1.07 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period. Net income and operating earnings for the first six months of 2003 also benefited from the aforementioned items from the second quarter of 2003 (see paragraph six). A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: (1) Net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, include gains on sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures related to discontinued operations of $98 million and $57 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. In addition, net investment-related (gains) losses, net of income taxes, exclude gains of $23 million and $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, from scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting. (2) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2004 relates to the adoption of AICPA Statement of Position 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-Traditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts. SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income to operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 22% Institutional Business operating earnings for the second quarter of 2004 were $317 million, compared with $260 million in the prior year period. Strong interest spreads in Retirement and Savings, which are primarily attributable to asset growth, contributed to the increase, while underwriting results in Group Life remained favorable. This was partially offset by a decrease in non-medical health operating earnings, due primarily to a decline in underwriting margins in the 3
dental and individual disability businesses. In addition, the current period also benefited from a $31 million after-tax reduction to a previously established premium tax liability. During the quarter, Group Life premiums, fees and other revenues grew 8% over the prior year period primarily due to strong sales and persistency and, in part, to the late 2003 acquisition of John Hancock's group life insurance business. Retirement and Savings net investment income grew 10% due to an increase in the asset base as well as higher investment spreads. Non-medical health insurance premiums, fees and other revenues increased 12% during the quarter due to continued growth in both the Small Business Center and the Long-Term Care business. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 39% Individual Business operating earnings were $210 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with $151 million in the prior year period. Results in Individual Business were driven by higher earnings in the annuity product line due to growth in separate account and strong interest spreads. Traditional Life results benefited from favorable mortality while Variable Life/Universal Life results reflected adverse mortality experience. Fees for the investment-type products within the Annuity business increased by 64%, compared with the year ago period. In addition, first year premiums and deposits for the Variable and Universal Life business were up 36% from the prior year period, largely driven by high initial premium Universal Life sales. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 69% Auto & Home operating earnings were $71 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with $42 million in the prior year period. Results benefited from an improved combined ratio (93.1%), driven by continued reductions in auto and homeowners non-catastrophe frequencies, lower auto severities and higher average earned premiums. INTERNATIONAL International operating earnings were $41 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with $102 million in the prior year period. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2003 includes $62 million of after-tax benefits related to the merger of the company's Mexican operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities related to a change in reserve methodology. ASSET MANAGEMENT Asset Management operating earnings were $16 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with $5 million in the prior year period. The increase was due to higher performance fees earned on certain institutional products during the quarter. INVESTMENTS During the 2004 quarter, the company completed the sale of Sears Tower, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $85 million. Corporate joint venture income, bond prepayment fees and commercial mortgage prepayments were at higher than normal levels during the quarter and further improved the investment spreads across all segments. 4
CORPORATE EVENTS For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the company repurchased through its share repurchase program approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $210 million. At June 30, 2004, the company had approximately $434 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. During the second quarter, MetLife made a $32 million after-tax contribution to MetLife Foundation, the company's non-profit organization. This item is recorded in Corporate & Other in other expenses. MetLife is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 1997-1999. Management anticipates that it may resolve all issues related to the IRS's audit before filing its 10-Q for this quarter. If the audit is resolved in the timeframe anticipated, the effect of the audit will be reflected in a revision to the second quarter financial results disclosed in this release. MetLife believes that if the audit is concluded as expected, second quarter 2004 consolidated financial results will be favorably impacted. Any earnings adjustment will be reflected in the 10-Q.

NOTE: - ----- The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding certain net investment-related gains and losses, net of income taxes, and the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes. Scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share in analyzing its performance; it believes that these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of certain investment-related gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating earnings per diluted share to GAAP net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release, dated July 28, 2004, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, which are available at www.metlife.com. 1

(10) Accounting standards require gains or losses resulting from the redemption of a subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock be excluded from the income statement. Rather, such gains or losses are recorded in capital in excess of par value on the balance sheet. However, such gains or losses are included in the calculation of net income per share. During the first quarter of 2003, net income per share includes a $21 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) charge associated with the Company's redemption of MetLife Capital Trust I's mandatorily redeemable capital securities. 2
