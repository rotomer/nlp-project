Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On September 28, 2004, the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. (the "Company"), approved the terms of an Agreement, Waiver and General Release (the "Agreement") between Stewart G. Nagler and MetLife Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, regarding the cessation of Mr. Nagler's employment. Mr. Nagler has been Vice Chairman of the Board of the Company since September 1999, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, since July 1998. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Nagler's employment and his directorships with such entities have been terminated effective August 31, 2004. Under the Agreement, the Board of the Company will recommend that Mr. Nagler receive a lump sum payment of $800,000 under the Company's Annual Variable Incentive Plan ("AVIP"), which would be paid at the next time payments are made to all other participants in the AVIP. The Agreement also provides for (i) a lump sum payment of $223,334 and (ii) an enhancement to his total pension benefit aggregating approximately $243,000, resulting from calculating such benefit as if he had reached age 62 at the time of retirement rather than his actual age at the time of retirement, age 61 and 7 months, both amounts payable shortly after the date the Board approved the Agreement.
