Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On December 14, 2004, the MetLife, Inc. board of directors (the "Board") approved the MetLife Leadership Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Leadership Plan"). The Leadership Plan allows officers and certain other employees of MetLife, Inc. affiliates to defer the receipt of salary, annual incentive compensation, and long-term incentive compensation payable in cash on and after January 1, 2005, and to defer the receipt of long-term incentive compensation payable in shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock on and after April 15, 2005, thereby deferring payment by participant of federal and most state income taxes on those amounts. Amounts deferred, once chosen, may not be changed by a participant, except in cases of hardship. Metlife, Inc. will match the value of participants' deferred compensation to the same extent that such compensation would have been matched under applicable savings and investment plans had it not been deferred under the Leadership Plan. Interest or simulated investment returns on deferred compensation is not determined on an above-market basis. The Leadership Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). Amounts deferred under the Leadership Plan are unsecured obligations of MetLife, Inc. On December 14, 2004, the Board also approved the MetLife Non-Management Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). The Directors' Plan allows directors, other than those who are employees of MetLife, Inc. or its affiliates, to defer the receipt of director fees, including compensation payable in shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock, payable on and after January 1, 2005, thereby deferring payment by the participant of federal and most state income taxes on those amounts. Amounts deferred, once chosen, may not be changed by a participant except in cases of hardship. Interest or simulated investment returns on deferred compensation is not determined on an above-market basis. The Directors' Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts deferred under the Directors' Plan are unsecured obligations of MetLife, Inc. On December 14, 2004, the Board also adopted a performance measure, from a selection of performance measures provided under Article 5 of the MetLife Annual Variable Incentive Plan ("AVIP"), which will govern the eligibility for awards under the AVIP of the Chief Executive Officer and each of MetLife, Inc.'s other officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Section 16 Officers"). The Board selected as the performance measure for awards under the AVIP, MetLife, Inc.'s net income excluding after-tax net investment gains and losses,excluding settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment, and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, determined according to generally accepted accounting principles, subject to the maximum award limit under the AVIP. The Compensation Committee of the Board retains the discretion to reduce the AVIP awards for the Chief Executive Officer and Section 16 Officers below the amount determined pursuant to the selected performance measure.
