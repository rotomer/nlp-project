[METLIFE LETTERHEAD & LOGO] Contacts: For Media: John Calagna (212) 578-6252 For Investors: Tracey Dedrick (212) 578-5140 METLIFE ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 RESULTS RECORD FULL YEAR NET INCOME OF $2.76 BILLION, UP 24% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR RECORD FULL YEAR OPERATING EARNINGS OF $2.65 BILLION, UP 18% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR NEW YORK, February 9, 2005 - MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) today reported fourth quarter 2004 net income of $511 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared with $701 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003. The company also reported that net income for 2004 was a record $2.76 billion, or $3.65 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.22 billion, or $2.94 per diluted share, for 2003. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS o Earned total premiums, fees and other revenues of $7.0 billion o Repurchased over 12 million common shares For the fourth quarter of 2004, net income of $511 million included net investment losses, net of income taxes, of $138 million and charges directly related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, of $3 million. Included in the net investment losses were $174 million of losses primarily related to derivatives which did not qualify for hedge accounting, net of income taxes. For the fourth quarter of 2003, net income of $701 million included net investment gains, net of income taxes, of $72 million and credits directly related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, of $90 million. Fourth quarter 2003 net income also included a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, of $26 million resulting from the required application of a new accounting standard. "For the third year in a row, MetLife had record net income and operating earnings as we continued to deliver top-line growth in excess of our targets," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. "During the fourth quarter, our results benefited from higher investment income resulting from the improved equity and credit markets." 1
"Throughout 2004, we continued to deliver on our financial objectives, grow our core businesses and build upon MetLife's strengthened foundation. Looking ahead, we are focused on achieving our 2005 goals and we are excited about the planned acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity. This transaction will give us an expanded presence in the individual, retirement and savings and international markets. All of MetLife's associates are committed to integrating this acquisition on schedule," added Benmosche. MetLife analyzes its performance using non-GAAP measures called operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share. Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income, excluding net investment gains and losses and directly related charges or credits, net of income taxes, and the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes. Discontinued operations and scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife believes these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses and directly related charges or credits, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $652 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared with $565 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the prior year period. A reconciliation of net income and net income per diluted share to operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share follows: 2

FOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT OVERVIEW Reconciliations of segment net income to operating earnings are provided in the tables that accompany this release. INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 11% Institutional Business operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $308 million, compared with $277 million in the prior year period. The improvement in earnings in the segment was primarily due to higher interest spreads and continued growth in the asset base for the company's Retirement and Savings business. Earnings in the group life and in the non-medical health and other businesses were essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Slightly higher underwriting and investment results were offset by higher expenses, including costs associated with the closing of one of the company's disability claims centers. During the quarter, group life premiums, fees and other revenues grew 9% over the prior year period primarily due to higher life sales and favorable persistency. Retirement and Savings net investment income grew 10% largely due to an increase in the asset base driven by favorable sales, particularly in the structured settlement business, and higher corporate joint venture income. Non-medical health premiums, fees and other revenues increased 16% over the prior year period due to continued growth in the small business market and long-term care. Growth in long-term care was due, in part, to the early 2004 acquisition of TIAA-CREF's long-term care insurance business. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS EARNINGS UP 16% Individual Business operating earnings were $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $173 million in the prior year period. Results in Individual Business were driven by higher earnings in the annuity product line due to overall growth in this product segment, as well as strong interest spreads. Variable/universal life results benefited from higher interest margins, improved mortality and higher fee income due to growth. Traditional life results reflected adverse mortality experience and the continuing decline in revenues from the company's closed block business. In addition, the unlocking of deferred policy acquisition costs during the quarter reduced earnings in the traditional, variable/universal life, and other businesses and increased earnings in the annuity business. Fees for the investment-type products within the annuity business increased by 29% compared with the year ago period. In addition, first year premiums and deposits for the universal life business were up 9% from the prior year period, while variable life sales continued to be depressed due to market conditions. AUTO & HOME EARNINGS UP 19% Auto & Home operating earnings were $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $53 million in the prior year period. Auto & Home's results benefited from an improved non-catastrophe combined ratio (92.2%) including favorable claim development related to prior accident years. These factors were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, including an additional $10 million, net of income taxes, for the hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter of 2004. 5
INTERNATIONAL International operating earnings were $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $34 million in the prior year period. Earnings in the International segment were adversely impacted by a strengthening of the company's liabilities on its Canadian pension business, as well as continuing investments in growth initiatives. INVESTMENTS During the 2004 quarter, corporate joint venture income, bond prepayment fees and commercial mortgage prepayment fees were at higher than normal levels. CORPORATE EVENTS Share Repurchase - ---------------- For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the company repurchased through its share repurchase program over 12 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $503 million. A portion of the repurchases were made through an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, through which the company repurchased approximately 7.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $300 million, subject to adjustment. At December 31, 2004, the company had approximately $710 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization. As a result of the company's agreement to acquire Travelers Life & Annuity from Citigroup, MetLife has currently suspended its share repurchase activity.

NOTE: - ----- The Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS") includes financial measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share, that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Operating earnings is defined as GAAP net income excluding certain net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, adjustments related to investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and the impact from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes. Discounted operations and scheduled settlement payments on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are included in operating earnings. Operating earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing operating earnings as defined above by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the period indicated. MetLife uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share in analyzing its performance; it believes that these measures enhance the understanding and comparability of its performance by excluding the net effect of investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, and adjustments related to net investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, both of which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as well as the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of income taxes, thereby highlighting the results from operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Reconciliations of operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating earnings per diluted share to GAAP net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included in the QFS and in MetLife's earnings press release, dated February 9, 2005, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, which are available at www.metlife.com. 1
